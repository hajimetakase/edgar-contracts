Section 3.1                                    Authorized Units; General 
Provisions With Respect to Units.
 
        (a)                                 Subject to the provisions of
        this Agreement, the Company shall be authorized to issue from time
        to time such number of Units and such other Equity Securities as
        the Managing Member shall determine in accordance with Section 3.3
        .  Each authorized Unit may be issued pursuant to such agreements
        as the Managing Member shall approve, including pursuant to options
        and warrants.  The Company may reissue any Units that have been
        repurchased or acquired by the Company.
 
        (b)                                 Each outstanding Unit shall be
        identical (except as provided in Section 3.1(e) or Section 3.3).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
        (c)                                  Initially, none of the Units
        will be represented by certificates.  If the Managing Member
        determines that it is in the interest of the Company to issue
        certificates representing the Units, certificates will be issued
        and the Units will be represented by those certificates, and this
        Agreement shall be amended as the Managing Member shall determine
        necessary or desirable to reflect the issuance of certificated
        Units for purposes of the Uniform Commercial Code.  Nothing
        contained in this Section 3.1(c) shall be deemed to authorize or
        permit any Member to Transfer its Units except as otherwise
        permitted under this Agreement.
 
        (d)                                 The total number of Units
        issued and outstanding and held by the Members is set forth on 
        Exhibit A (as amended from time to time in accordance with the
        terms of this Agreement) as of the date set forth therein.
 
        (e)                                  If, at any time after the
        Effective Time, PubCo issues a share of its Class A Common Stock or
        any other Equity Security of PubCo (other than shares of Class B
        Common Stock), (i) the Company shall concurrently issue to PubCo
        one Unit (if PubCo issues a share of Class A Common Stock), or such
        other Equity Security of the Company (if PubCo issues Equity
        Securities other than Class A Common Stock) corresponding to the
        Equity Securities issued by PubCo, and with substantially the same
        rights to dividends and distributions (including distributions upon
        liquidation) and other economic rights as those of such Equity
        Securities of PubCo to be issued and (ii) PubCo shall concurrently
        contribute to the Company the net proceeds or other property
        received by PubCo for such share of Class A Common Stock or other
        Equity Security; provided, however, that if PubCo issues any shares
        of Class A Common Stock in order to acquire or fund the acquisition
        from a Member of a number of Units (and shares of Class B Common
        Stock) equal to the number of shares of Class A Common Stock so
        issued, then the Company shall not issue any new Units in
        connection therewith and, where such shares of Class A Common Stock
        have been issued for cash to fund an acquisition, PubCo shall not
        be required to transfer such net proceeds to the Company, and such
        net proceeds shall instead be transferred to such Member as
        consideration for such acquisition.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,
        this Section 3.1(e) shall not apply to the issuance and
        distribution to holders of shares of PubCo Common Stock of rights
        to purchase Equity Securities of PubCo under a poison pill or
        similar shareholders rights plan (and upon any redemption of Units
        for Class A Common Stock, such Class A Common Stock will be issued
        together with a corresponding right under such plan), or to the
        issuance under PubCos employee benefit plans of any warrants,
        options, other rights to acquire Equity Securities of PubCo or
        rights or property that may be converted into or settled in Equity
        Securities of PubCo, but shall in each of the foregoing cases apply
        to the issuance of Equity Securities of PubCo in connection with
        the exercise or settlement of such rights, warrants, options or
        other rights or property.  Except pursuant to Section 3.6, (x) the
        Company may not issue any additional Units to PubCo or any of its
        Subsidiaries unless substantially simultaneously therewith PubCo or
        such Subsidiary issues or sells an equal number of newly-issued
        shares of PubCos Class A Common Stock to another Person, and (y)
        the Company may not issue any other Equity Securities of the
        Company to PubCo or any of its Subsidiaries unless substantially
        simultaneously PubCo or such Subsidiary issues or sells, to
 
16
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
        another Person, an equal number of newly-issued shares of a new
        class or series of Equity Securities of PubCo or such Subsidiary
        with substantially the same rights to dividends and distributions
        (including distributions upon liquidation) and other economic
        rights as those of such Equity Securities of the Company.  If at
        any time PubCo or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Company
        and its Subsidiaries) issues Debt Securities, PubCo or such
        Subsidiary shall transfer to the Company (in a manner to be
        determined by the Managing Member in its reasonable discretion) the
        proceeds received by PubCo or such Subsidiary in exchange for such
        Debt Securities in a manner that directly or indirectly burdens the
        Company with the repayment of the Debt Securities. In the event any
        Equity Security outstanding at PubCo is exercised or otherwise
        converted and, as a result, any shares of Class A Common Stock or
        other Equity Securities of PubCo are issued, the corresponding
        Equity Security outstanding at the Company shall be similarly
        exercised or otherwise converted, as applicable, and an equivalent
        number of Units or other Equity Securities of the Company shall be
        issued to PubCo as contemplated by the first sentence of this 
        Section 3.1(e).
 
        (f)                                   PubCo or any of its
        Subsidiaries may not redeem, repurchase or otherwise acquire (i)
        any shares of Class A Common Stock (including upon forfeiture of
        any unvested shares of Class A Common Stock) unless substantially
        simultaneously the Company redeems, repurchases or otherwise
        acquires from PubCo or such Subsidiary an equal number of Units for
        the same price per security or (ii) any other Equity Securities of
        PubCo, unless substantially simultaneously the Company redeems,
        repurchases or otherwise acquires from PubCo or such Subsidiary an
        equal number of Equity Securities of the Company of a corresponding
        class or series with substantially the same rights to dividends and
        distributions (including distributions upon liquidation) and other
        economic rights as those of such Equity Securities of PubCo for the
        same price per security.  The Company may not redeem, repurchase or
        otherwise acquire (x) except pursuant to Section 3.6, any Units
        from PubCo or any of its Subsidiaries unless substantially
        simultaneously PubCo or such Subsidiary redeems, repurchases or
        otherwise acquires an equal number of shares of Class A Common
        Stock for the same price per security from holders thereof, or (y)
        any other Equity Securities of the Company from PubCo or any of its
        Subsidiaries unless substantially simultaneously PubCo or such
        Subsidiary redeems, repurchases or otherwise acquires for the same
        price per security an equal number of Equity Securities of PubCo of
        a corresponding class or series with substantially the same rights
        to dividends and distributions (including distribution upon
        liquidation) and other economic rights as those of such Equity
        Securities of PubCo. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent
        that any consideration payable by PubCo in connection with the
        redemption or repurchase of any shares of Class A Common Stock or
        other Equity Securities of PubCo or any of its Subsidiaries
        consists (in whole or in part) of shares of Class A Common Stock or
        such other Equity Securities (including, for the avoidance of
        doubt, in connection with the cashless exercise of an option or
        warrant), then the redemption or repurchase of the corresponding
        Units or other Equity Securities of the Company shall be
        effectuated in an equivalent manner.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

         
        (g)                                  The Company shall not in any
        manner effect any subdivision (by any equity split, equity
        distribution, reclassification, recapitalization or otherwise) or
        combination (by reverse equity split, reclassification,
        recapitalization or otherwise) of the outstanding Units unless
        accompanied by an identical subdivision or combination, as
        applicable, of the outstanding PubCo Common Stock, with
        corresponding changes made with respect to any other exchangeable
        or convertible securities.  PubCo shall not in any manner effect
        any subdivision (by any equity split, equity distribution,
        reclassification, recapitalization or otherwise) or combination (by
        reverse equity split, reclassification, recapitalization or
        otherwise) of the outstanding PubCo Common Stock unless accompanied
        by an identical subdivision or combination, as applicable, of the
        outstanding Units, with corresponding changes made with respect to
        any other exchangeable or convertible securities.
 
        (h)                                 Notwithstanding any other
        provision of this Agreement (including Section 3.1(e)), if PubCo
        holds any excess cash amount, PubCo may, in its sole discretion,
        contribute such excess cash amount to the Company in exchange for a
        number of Units or other Equity Securities of the Company
        determined in its sole discretion, and distribute to the holders of
        Class A Common Stock shares of Class A Common Stock (if the Company
        issues Units to PubCo) or such other Equity Security of PubCo (if
        the Company issues Equity Securities of the Company other than
        Units) corresponding to the Equity Securities issued by the Company
        and with substantially the same rights to dividends and
        distributions (including distributions upon liquidation) and other
        economic rights as those of such Equity Securities of the Company
        issued.
 
Section 3.2                                    Voting Rights.  No Member 
has any voting right except with respect to those matters specifically 
reserved for a Member vote under the Act and for matters expressly 
requiring the approval of Members under this Agreement.  Except as 
otherwise required by the Act, each Unit will entitle the holder thereof to 
one vote on all matters to be voted on by the Members.  Except as otherwise 
expressly provided in this Agreement, the holders of Units having voting 
rights will vote together as a single class on all matters to be approved 
by the Members.
 
Section 3.3                                    Capital Contributions; Unit 
Ownership.
 
        (a)                                 Capital Contributions.  Except
        as otherwise set forth in Section 3.1(e), no Member shall be
        required to make additional Capital Contributions.
 
        (b)                                 Issuance of Additional Units or
        Interests.  Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
        Agreement, the Managing Member shall have the right to authorize
        and cause the Company to issue on such terms (including price) as
        may be determined by the Managing Member (i) subject to the
        limitations of Section 3.1, additional Units or other Equity
        Securities in the Company (including creating preferred interests
        or other classes or series of interests having such rights,
        preferences and privileges as determined by the Managing Member,
        which rights, preferences and privileges may be senior to the
        Units), and (ii) obligations, evidences of Indebtedness or other
        securities or interests convertible or exchangeable for Units or
        other Equity Securities in the Company; provided that, at any time
        following the Effective Date, in each case the Company shall not
        issue Equity Securities in the Company to any
 
18
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
        Person unless such Person shall have executed a counterpart to this
        Agreement and all other documents, agreements or instruments deemed
        necessary or desirable in the discretion of the Managing Member. 
        Upon such issuance and execution, such Person shall be admitted as
        a Member of the Company.  In that event, the Managing Member shall
        amend Exhibit A to reflect such additional issuances.  Subject to 
        Section 11.1, the Managing Member is hereby authorized to amend
        this Agreement to set forth the designations, preferences, rights,
        powers and duties of such additional Units or other Equity
        Securities in the Company, or such other amendments that the
        Managing Member determines to be otherwise necessary or appropriate
        in connection with the creation, authorization or issuance of, any
        class or series of Units or other Equity Securities in the Company
        pursuant to this Section 3.3(b); provided that, notwithstanding the
        foregoing, the Managing Member shall have the right to amend this
        Agreement as set forth in this sentence without the approval of any
        other Person (including any Member) and notwithstanding any other
        provision of this Agreement (including Section 11.1) if such
        amendment is necessary in order to consummate any offering of
        shares of PubCo Common Stock or other Equity Securities of PubCo
        provided that the designations, preferences, rights, powers and
        duties of any such additional Units or other Equity Securities of
        the Company as set forth in such amendment are substantially
        similar to those applicable to such shares of PubCo Common Stock or
        other Equity Securities of PubCo.
 
Section 3.4                                    Capital Accounts.  A Capital 
Account shall be maintained for each Member in accordance with the 
provisions of Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv) and, to the 
extent consistent with such regulations, the other provisions of this 
Agreement.  Each Members Capital Account balance as of the Effective Date 
shall be equal to the amount of its respective Closing Date Capital Account 
Balance set forth opposite such Members name on Exhibit A.  Thereafter, 
each Members Capital Account shall be (a) increased by (i) allocations to 
such Member of Profits pursuant to Section 4.1 and any other items of 
income or gain allocated to such Member pursuant to Section 4.2, (ii) the 
amount of additional cash or the initial Gross Asset Value of any asset 
(net of any Liabilities assumed by the Member and any Liabilities to which 
the asset is subject) contributed to the Company by such Member, and (iii) 
any other increases allowed or required by Treasury Regulations Section 
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv), and (b) decreased by (i) allocations to such Member of 
Losses pursuant to Section 4.1 and any other items of deduction or loss 
allocated to such Member pursuant to the provisions of Section 4.2, (ii) 
the amount of any cash or the Gross Asset Value of any asset (net of any 
Liabilities assumed by the Member and any Liabilities to which the asset is 
subject) distributed to such Member, and (iii) any other decreases allowed 
or required by Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv).  In the 
event of a Transfer of Units made in accordance with this Agreement 
(including a deemed Transfer for U.S. federal income tax purposes as 
described in Section 3.6(a)(iv)), the Capital Account of the Transferor 
that is attributable to the Transferred Units shall carry over to the 
Transferee Member in accordance with the provisions of Treasury Regulations 
Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(l).
 
Section 3.5                                    Other Matters.
 
        (a)                                 No Member shall demand or
        receive a return on or of its Capital Contributions or withdraw
        from the Company without the consent of the Managing Member.  Under
 
19
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
        circumstances requiring a return of any Capital Contributions, no
        Member has the right to receive property other than cash.
 
        (b)                                 No Member shall receive any
        interest, salary, compensation, draw or reimbursement with respect
        to its Capital Contributions or its Capital Account, or for
        services rendered or expenses incurred on behalf of the Company or
        otherwise in its capacity as a Member, except as otherwise provided
        in Section 6.9 or as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement.
 
        (c)                                  The Liability of each Member
        shall be limited as set forth in the Act and other applicable Law
        and, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement or required by
        Law, no Member (or any of its Affiliates) shall be personally
        liable, whether to the Company, any of the other Members, the
        creditors of the Company, or any other third party, for any debt or
        Liability of the Company, whether arising in contract, tort or
        otherwise, solely by reason of being a Member of the Company.
 
        (d)                                 Except as otherwise required by
        the Act, a Member shall not be required to restore a deficit
        balance in such Members Capital Account, to lend any funds to the
        Company or, except as otherwise set forth herein, to make any
        additional contributions or payments to the Company.
 
        (e)                                  The Company shall not be
        obligated to repay any Capital Contributions of any Member.
 
Section 3.6                                    Redemption of Units.
 
        (a)                                 (i) Upon the terms and subject
        to the conditions set forth in this Section 3.6, each of the
        Members (other than PubCo and its wholly-owned Subsidiaries) (the 
        Redeeming Member) shall be entitled to cause the Company to redeem
        all or a portion of such Members Units (together with the transfer
        and surrender of the same number of shares of Class B Common Stock)
        for an equivalent number of shares of Class A Common Stock (a 
        Redemption) or, at the Companys election made in accordance with 
        Section 3.6(a)(iv), cash equal to the Cash Election Amount
        calculated with respect to such Redemption.  A Redeeming Member
        shall be permitted to effect a Redemption of Units no more
        frequently than once per calendar quarter. The Managing Member may,
        in its discretion, adopt a policy to limit quarterly exchanges to a
        particular period during each quarter.  With respect to each
        Redemption, a Redeeming Member shall be required to redeem at least
        a number of Units equal to the lesser of (A) 2,500 Units and (B)
        All Owned Units (excluding, for this purpose only, HoldCo Units not
        eligible for redemption pursuant to the terms of the A&R HoldCo
        Agreement at the time of the relevant Redemption).  
        Notwithstanding the preceding clause (A) of this Section 3.6(a)(i),
        with respect to each Redemption, if the Redeeming Member is any of
        Bender Investment Company, Scott Bender, Joel Bender, Steven
        Bender, Cadent Energy Partners II, L.P. (or any affiliated funds or
        investment vehicles managed by Cadent Energy Partners, LLC) or Lee
        Boquet, such Redeeming Member  shall be required to redeem at least
        a number of Units equal to the lesser of 10,000 Units and All Owned
        Units, and if the
 
20
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
        Redeeming Member is a Former A-1 Unitholder, such Redeeming Member 
        shall be required to redeem at least a number of Units equal to the
        lesser of 1,000 Units and All Owned Units (excluding, for this
        purpose only, HoldCo Units not eligible for redemption pursuant to
        the terms of the A&R HoldCo Agreement at the time of the relevant
        Redemption).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, subject to Section
        3.6(j) and Section 3.6(k), a Redeeming Member may exercise its
        redemption right with respect to All Owned Units of such Member or
        at least 1,000,000 Units at any time. Upon the Redemption of all of
        a Members Units, such Member shall, for the avoidance of doubt,
        cease to be a Member of the Company.
 
            (ii)                                  In order to exercise the
            redemption right under Section 3.6(a)(i), the Redeeming Member
            shall provide written notice (the Redemption Notice) to the
            Company, with a copy to PubCo (the date of delivery of such
            Redemption Notice, the Redemption Notice Date), stating:
 
                (A)                               the number of Units
                (together with the transfer and surrender of an equal
                number of shares of Class B Common Stock) the Redeeming
                Member elects to have the Company redeem;
 
                (B)                               if the shares of Class A
                Common Stock to be received are to be issued other than in
                the name of the Redeeming Member, the name(s) of the
                Person(s) in whose name or on whose order the shares of
                Class A Common Stock are to be issued;
 
                (C)                               if the shares of Class A
                Common Stock are then publicly traded, whether the exercise
                of the redemption right is contingent upon the price of a
                share of Class A Common Stock at the close of business on
                the last trading day prior to the Redemption Date (as
                reported by Bloomberg, L.P. or its successor) being equal
                to a specified price, and, if so, such price;
 
                (D)                               whether the exercise of
                the redemption right is to be contingent (including as to
                timing) upon the closing of an underwritten offering of the
                shares of Class A Common Stock for which the Units will be
                redeemed or the closing of an announced merger,
                consolidation or other transaction or event to which PubCo
                is a party in which the shares of Class A Common Stock
                would be exchanged or converted or become exchangeable for
                or convertible into cash or other securities or property;
                and
 
                (E)                                if the Redeeming Member
                requires the Redemption to take place on a specific
                Business Day, such Business Day, provided that, any such
                specified Business Day not be earlier than the date that
                would otherwise apply pursuant to clause (a) of the
                definition of Redemption Date.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
            (iii)                               If the Units to be redeemed
            (or the shares of Class B Common Stock to be transferred and
            surrendered) by the Redeeming Member are represented by a
            certificate or certificates, prior to the Redemption Date, the
            Redeeming Member shall also present and surrender such
            certificate or certificates representing such Units (or shares
            of Class B Common Stock) during normal business hours at the
            principal executive offices of the Company, or if any agent for
            the registration or transfer of Class A Common Stock is then
            duly appointed and acting (the Transfer Agent), at the office
            of the Transfer Agent.  If required by the Managing Member, any
            certificate for Units and any certificate for shares of Class B
            Common Stock (in each case, if certificated) surrendered to the
            Company hereunder shall be accompanied by instruments of
            transfer, in forms reasonably satisfactory to the Managing
            Member and the Transfer Agent, duly executed by the Redeeming
            Member or the Redeeming Members duly authorized
            representative.
 
            (iv)                              Upon receipt of a Redemption
            Notice, the Company shall be entitled to elect (a Cash
            Election) to settle the Redemption by delivering to the
            Redeeming Member, in lieu of the applicable number of shares of
            Class A Common Stock that would be received in such Redemption,
            an amount of cash equal to the Cash Election Amount for such
            Redemption.  In order to make a Cash Election with respect to a
            Redemption, the Company must provide written notice of such
            election to the Redeeming Member (with a copy to PubCo) prior
            to 1:00 p.m., Houston time, on the seventh Business Day after
            the Redemption Notice Date.  If the Company fails to provide
            such written notice prior to such time, it shall not be
            entitled to make a Cash Election with respect to such
            Redemption.
 
            (v)                                 For U.S. federal income
            (and applicable state and local) tax purposes, each of the
            Redeeming Member, the Company and PubCo, as the case may be,
            agree to treat each Redemption and, in the event PubCo
            exercises its Call Right, each Call Purchase, as a sale of the
            Redeeming Members Units (together with the same number of
            shares of Class B Common Stock) to PubCo in exchange for shares
            of Class A Common Stock or cash, as applicable.
 
            (b)                                                            
                                (i) Subject to the satisfaction of any
            contingency described in Section 3.6(a)(ii)(C) or (D) that is
            specified in the relevant Redemption Notice, the Redemption
            shall be completed on the Redemption Date; provided, that if a
            valid Cash Election has not been made and a Retraction
            Condition occurs, the Redeeming Member may, at any time prior
            to the Redemption Date, revoke its Redemption Notice or delay
            the consummation of a Redemption by giving written notice (the
            Retraction Notice) to the Company (with a copy to PubCo); 
            provided that in no event shall the Redeeming Member seeking to
            revoke or delay the consummation of such Redemption and relying
            on any of the matters contemplated in the definition of
            Retraction Condition have controlled or intentionally
            materially influenced any facts, circumstances, or Persons in
            connection therewith (except in the good faith performance of
            his or her duties as an officer or director of PubCo) in order
 
22
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
            to provide such Redeeming Member with a basis for such
            revocation or delay.  The timely delivery of a Retraction
            Notice that revokes a Redemption Notice shall terminate all of
            the Redeeming Members, the Companys and PubCos rights and
            obligations arising from the retracted Redemption Notice.  If a
            Redeeming Member delays the consummation of a Redemption
            pursuant to a Retraction Notice, (A) unless the Redeeming
            Member delivers a Retraction Notice in accordance with Section
            3.6(b)(i)(B), the Redemption Date shall occur on the first
            Business Day following the date on which the conditions giving
            rise to such delay cease to exist (or such earlier day as
            PubCo, the Company and such Redeeming Member may agree in
            writing) and (B) the Redeeming Member may retract its
            Redemption Notice by giving a Retraction Notice to the Company
            (with a copy to PubCo) at any time prior to the date on which
            the conditions giving rise to such delay cease to exist.
 
            (ii)                                  Unless the Redeeming
            Member has timely delivered a Retraction Notice revoking a
            Redemption Notice as provided in Section 3.6(b)(i) or PubCo has
            elected its Call Right pursuant to Section 3.6(f), on the
            Redemption Date (to be effective immediately prior to the close
            of business on the Redemption Date) (A) the Redeeming Member
            shall transfer and surrender the Units to be redeemed (and a
            corresponding number of shares of Class B Common Stock) to the
            Company, in each case free and clear of all liens and
            encumbrances, (B) PubCo shall contribute to the Company the
            consideration the Redeeming Member is entitled to receive under 
            Section 3.6(a)(i) or Section 3.6(a)(iv) and, as described in 
            Section 3.1(e), the Company shall issue to PubCo a number of
            Units or other Equity Securities of the Company as
            consideration for such contribution, (C) the Company shall (x)
            cancel the redeemed Units, (y) transfer to the Redeeming Member
            the consideration the Redeeming Member is entitled to receive
            under Section 3.6(a)(i) or Section 3.6(a)(iv), and (z) if the
            Units are certificated, issue to the Redeeming Member a
            certificate for a number of Units equal to the difference (if
            any) between the number of Units evidenced by the certificate
            surrendered by the Redeeming Member pursuant to clause (ii)(A)
            of this Section 3.6(b) and the number of redeemed Units, and
            (D) PubCo shall cancel the surrendered shares of Class B Common
            Stock.
 
        (c)                                  If (i) there is any
        reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization or other similar
        transaction pursuant to which the shares of Class A Common Stock
        are converted or changed into another security, securities or other
        property (other than as a result of a subdivision or combination or
        any transaction subject to Section 3.1(g)), or (ii) PubCo, by
        dividend or otherwise, distributes to all holders of the shares of
        Class A Common Stock evidences of its Indebtedness or assets,
        including securities (including shares of Class A Common Stock and
        any rights, options or warrants to all holders of the shares of
        Class A Common Stock to subscribe for or to purchase or to
        otherwise acquire shares of Class A Common Stock, or other
        securities or rights convertible into, exchangeable for or
        exercisable for shares of Class A Common Stock) but excluding any
        cash dividend or distribution as well as any such distribution of
        Indebtedness or assets received by PubCo from the Company in
 
23
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
        respect of the Units, then upon any subsequent Redemption, in
        addition to the shares of Class A Common Stock or the Cash Election
        Amount, as applicable, each Member shall be entitled to receive the
        amount of such security, securities or other property that such
        Member would have received if such Redemption had occurred
        immediately prior to the effective date of such reclassification,
        reorganization, recapitalization, other similar transaction,
        dividend or other distribution, taking into account any adjustment
        as a result of any subdivision (by any split, distribution or
        dividend, reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization or
        otherwise) or combination (by reverse split, reclassification,
        recapitalization or otherwise) of such security, securities or
        other property that occurs after the effective time of such
        reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization or other similar
        transaction.  For the avoidance of doubt, if there is any
        reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization or other similar
        transaction in which the shares of Class A Common Stock are
        converted or changed into another security, securities or other
        property, or any dividend or distribution (other than an excluded
        dividend or distribution, as described above), this Section 3.6 
        shall continue to be applicable, mutatis mutandis, with respect to
        such security or other property. This Agreement shall apply to the
        Units held by the Members as of the Effective Date, as well as any
        Units hereafter acquired by a Member, including Members who receive
        their Units pursuant to Section 8.3 of the A&R HoldCo Agreement.
 
        (d)                                 PubCo shall at all times keep
        available, solely for the purpose of issuance upon a Redemption,
        out of its authorized but unissued shares of Class A Common Stock
        or other Equity Securities, such number of shares of Class A Common
        Stock that shall be issuable upon the Redemption of all outstanding
        Units (other than those Units held by PubCo or any Subsidiary of
        PubCo); provided, that nothing contained herein shall be construed
        to preclude PubCo from satisfying its obligations with respect to a
        Redemption by delivery of cash pursuant to a Cash Election or
        shares of Class A Common Stock or other Equity Securities that are
        held in the treasury of PubCo. PubCo covenants that all shares of
        Class A Common Stock and other Equity Securities that shall be
        issued upon a Redemption shall, upon issuance thereof, be validly
        issued, fully paid and non-assessable.  In addition, for so long as
        the shares of Class A Common Stock or other Equity Securities are
        listed on a National Securities Exchange, PubCo shall use its
        reasonable best efforts to cause all shares of Class A Common Stock
        and such other Equity Securities issued upon a Redemption to be
        listed on such National Securities Exchange at the time of such
        issuance.
 
        (e)                                  The issuance of shares of
        Class A Common Stock or other Equity Securities upon a Redemption
        shall be made without charge to the Redeeming Member for any stamp
        or other similar tax in respect of such issuance; provided, 
        however, that if any such shares of Class A Common Stock or other
        Equity Securities are to be issued in a name other than that of the
        Redeeming Member, then the Person or Persons in whose name the
        shares are to be issued shall pay to PubCo the amount of any tax
        that may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in such
        issuance or shall establish to the satisfaction of PubCo that such
        tax has been paid or is not payable.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
        (f)                                   (i) Notwithstanding anything
        to the contrary in this Section 3.6, but subject to Section 3.6(g)
        , a Redeeming Member shall be deemed to have offered to sell its
        Units as described in the Redemption Notice to PubCo, and PubCo
        may, in its sole discretion, by means of delivery of a Call
        Election Notice in accordance with, and subject to the terms of,
        this Section 3.6(f), elect to purchase directly and acquire such
        Units (together with the transfer and surrender of the same number
        of shares of Class B Common Stock) on the Redemption Date by paying
        to the Redeeming Member (or, on the Redeeming Members written
        order and subject to Section 3.6(e), its designee) that number of
        shares of Class A Common Stock the Redeeming Member (or its
        designee) would otherwise receive pursuant to Section 3.6(a)(i) or,
        at PubCos election, an amount of cash equal to the Cash Election
        Amount of such shares of Class A Common Stock (the Call Right),
        whereupon PubCo shall acquire the Units offered for redemption by
        the Redeeming Member (together with the transfer and surrender of
        the same number of shares of Class B Common Stock to PubCo for
        cancellation).  PubCo shall be treated for all purposes of this
        Agreement as the owner of such Units; provided that if PubCo funds
        the Cash Election Amount other than through the issuance of shares
        of Class A Common Stock, such Units will be reclassified into
        another Equity Security of the Company if the Managing Member
        determines such reclassification is necessary.
 
            (ii)                                  PubCo may, at any time
            prior to the Redemption Date, in its sole discretion deliver
            written notice (a Call Election Notice) to the Company and
            the Redeeming Member setting forth its election to exercise its
            Call Right.  A Call Election Notice may be revoked by PubCo at
            any time; provided that any such revocation does not prejudice
            the ability of the parties to consummate a Redemption on the
            Redemption Date.  Except as otherwise provided by this Section
            3.6(f), an exercise of the Call Right shall be consummated
            pursuant to the same timeframe and in the same manner as the
            relevant Redemption would have been consummated if PubCo had
            not delivered a Call Election Notice.
 
        (g)                                  In connection with a PubCo
        Change of Control, PubCo shall have the right, in its sole
        discretion, to require each Member (other than PubCo and its
        wholly-owned Subsidiaries) to effect a Redemption of some or all of
        such Members Units (together with the transfer and surrender of
        the same number of shares of Class B Common Stock); provided that a
        Cash Election shall not be permitted pursuant to such a Redemption
        under this Section 3.6(g).  Any Redemption pursuant to this 
        Section 3.6(g) shall be effective immediately prior to the
        consummation of the PubCo Change of Control (and, for the avoidance
        of doubt, shall not be effective if such PubCo Change of Control is
        not consummated) (the Change of Control Redemption Date).  From
        and after the Change of Control Redemption Date, (i) the Units and
        shares of Class B Common Stock subject to such Redemption shall be
        deemed to be transferred to PubCo on the Change of Control
        Redemption Date and (ii) such Member shall cease to have any rights
        with respect to the Units and shares of Class B Common Stock
        subject to such Redemption (other than the right to receive shares
        of Class A Common Stock pursuant to such Redemption).  PubCo shall
        provide written notice of an expected PubCo Change of Control to
        all Members
 
25
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
        within the earlier of (x) five (5) Business Days following the
        execution of the agreement with respect to such PubCo Change of
        Control and (y) ten (10) Business Days before the proposed date
        upon which the contemplated PubCo Change of Control is to be
        effected, indicating in such notice such information as may
        reasonably describe the PubCo Change of Control transaction,
        subject to applicable law, including the date of execution of such
        agreement or such proposed effective date, as applicable, the
        amount and types of consideration to be paid for shares of Class A
        Common Stock in the PubCo Change of Control, any election with
        respect to types of consideration that a holder of shares of Class
        A Common Stock, as applicable, shall be entitled to make in
        connection with such PubCo Change of Control, and the number of
        Units (and corresponding shares of Class B Common Stock) held by
        such Member that PubCo intends to require to be subject to such
        Redemption.  Following delivery of such notice and on or prior to
        the Change of Control Redemption Date, the Members shall take all
        actions reasonably requested by PubCo to effect such Redemption,
        including taking any action and delivering any document required
        pursuant to the remainder of this Section 3.6 to effect a
        Redemption.
 
        (h)                                 No Redemption shall impair the
        right of the Redeeming Member to receive any distributions payable
        on the Units redeemed pursuant to such Redemption in respect of a
        record date that occurs prior to the Redemption Date for such
        Redemption.  For the avoidance of doubt, no Redeeming Member, or a
        Person designated by a Redeeming Member to receive shares of Class
        A Common Stock, shall be entitled to receive, with respect to such
        record date, distributions or dividends both on Units redeemed by
        the Company from such Redeeming Member and on shares of Class A
        Common Stock received by such Redeeming Member, or other Person so
        designated, if applicable, in such Redemption.
 
        (i)                                     Any Units acquired by the
        Company under this Section 3.6 and transferred by the Company to
        PubCo shall remain outstanding and shall not be cancelled as a
        result of their acquisition by the Company.  Notwithstanding any
        other provision of this Agreement, PubCo shall be automatically
        admitted as a Member of the Company with respect to any Units or
        other Equity Securities in the Company it receives under this
        Agreement (including under this Section 3.6 in connection with any
        Redemption).
 
        (j)                                    Notwithstanding any other
        provision of this Section 3.6, the Managing Member may, by written
        notice to the Members, suspend the redemption rights of the Members
        as set forth in this Section 3.6 for an aggregate period of up to
        90 days in any calendar year.  For the avoidance of doubt,
        following the delivery of a Redemption Notice by any Redeeming
        Member, if the Managing Member suspends the redemption rights of
        the Members, such Redeeming Member may deliver a Retraction Notice
        and revoke its Redemption Notice at any time prior to the later of
        (x) the applicable Redemption Date or (y) the date of the
        consummation of the applicable Redemption.
 
        (k)                                 The Managing Member may impose
        additional limitations and restrictions on Redemptions (including
        limiting Redemptions or creating priority procedures for
 
26
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
        Redemptions), to the extent it determines, in its sole discretion,
        such limitations and restrictions to be necessary or appropriate to
        avoid undue risk that the Company may be classified as a publicly
        traded partnership within the meaning of Section 7704 of the Code.
         Furthermore, the Managing Member may require any Member or group
        of Members to redeem all of their Units to the extent it
        determines, in its sole discretion, that such Redemption is
        necessary or appropriate to avoid undue risk that the Company may
        be classified as a publicly traded partnership within the meaning
        of Section 7704 of the Code.  Upon delivery of any notice by the
        Managing Member to such Member or group of Members requiring such
        Redemption, such Member or group of Members shall exchange, subject
        to exercise by PubCo of its Call Right pursuant to Section
        3.6(f)(i), all of their Units effective as of the date specified in
        such notice (and such date shall be deemed to be a Redemption Date
        for purposes of this Agreement) in accordance with this Section 3.6 
        and otherwise in accordance with the requirements set forth in such
        notice.
 
ARTICLE IV
 
ALLOCATIONS OF PROFITS AND LOSSES
 
Section 4.1                                    Profits and Losses.  After 
giving effect to the allocations under Section 4.2 and subject to Section 
4.4, Profits and Losses (and, to the extent determined by the Managing 
Member to be necessary and appropriate to achieve the resulting Capital 
Account balances described below, any allocable items of income, gain, 
loss, deduction or credit includable in the computation of Profits and 
Losses) for each Fiscal Year or other taxable period shall be allocated 
among the Members during such Fiscal Year or other taxable period in a 
manner such that, after giving effect to the special allocations set forth 
in Section 4.2 and all distributions through the end of such Fiscal Year or 
other taxable period, the Capital Account balance of each Member, 
immediately after making such allocation, is, as nearly as possible, equal 
to (i) the amount such Member would receive pursuant to Section 10.3(b) if 
all assets of the Company on hand at the end of such Fiscal Year or other 
taxable period were sold for cash equal to their Gross Asset Values, all 
liabilities of the Company were satisfied in cash in accordance with their 
terms (limited with respect to each nonrecourse liability to the Gross 
Asset Value of the assets securing such liability), and all remaining or 
resulting cash was distributed, in accordance with Section 10.3(b), to the 
Members immediately after making such allocation, minus (ii) such Members 
share of Company Minimum Gain and Member Minimum Gain, computed immediately 
prior to the hypothetical sale of assets, and the amount any such Member is 
treated as obligated to contribute to the Company, computed immediately 
after the hypothetical sale of assets.
 
Section 4.2                                    Special Allocations.
 
        (a)                                 Nonrecourse Deductions for any
        Fiscal Year or other taxable period shall be specially allocated to
        the Members under any method determined by the Managing Member to
        be appropriate and in accordance with the applicable Treasury
        Regulations. The amount of Nonrecourse Deductions for a Fiscal Year
        or other taxable period shall equal the excess, if any, of the net
        increase, if any, in the amount of Company Minimum Gain during that
        Fiscal Year or other taxable period over the
 
27
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
        aggregate amount of any distributions during that Fiscal Year or
        other taxable period of proceeds of a Nonrecourse Liability that
        are allocable to an increase in Company Minimum Gain, determined in
        accordance with the provisions of Treasury Regulations Section
        1.704-2(d).
 
        (b)                                 Any Member Nonrecourse
        Deductions for any Fiscal Year or other taxable period shall be
        specially allocated to the Member who bears economic risk of loss
        with respect to the Member Nonrecourse Debt to which such Member
        Nonrecourse Deductions are attributable in accordance with Treasury
        Regulations Section 1.704-2(i).  If more than one Member bears the
        economic risk of loss for such Member Nonrecourse Debt, the Member
        Nonrecourse Deductions attributable to such Member Nonrecourse Debt
        shall be allocated among the Members according to the ratio in
        which they bear the economic risk of loss.  This Section 4.2(b) is
        intended to comply with the provisions of Treasury Regulations
        Section 1.704-2(i) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith.
 
        (c)                                  Notwithstanding any other
        provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if there is a net
        decrease in Company Minimum Gain during any Fiscal Year or other
        taxable period (or if there was a net decrease in Company Minimum
        Gain for a prior Fiscal Year or other taxable period and the
        Company did not have sufficient amounts of income and gain during
        prior periods to allocate among the Members under this Section
        4.2(c)), each Member shall be specially allocated items of Company
        income and gain for such Fiscal Year or other taxable period in an
        amount equal to such Members share of the net decrease in Company
        Minimum Gain during such year (as determined pursuant to Treasury
        Regulations Section 1.704-2(g)(2)).  This section is intended to
        constitute a minimum gain chargeback under Treasury Regulations
        Section 1.704-2(f) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith.
 
        (d)                                 Notwithstanding any other
        provision of this Agreement except Section 4.2(c), if there is a
        net decrease in Member Minimum Gain during any Fiscal Year or other
        taxable period (or if there was a net decrease in Member Minimum
        Gain for a prior Fiscal Year or other taxable period and the
        Company did not have sufficient amounts of income and gain during
        prior periods to allocate among the Members under this Section
        4.2(d)), each Member shall be specially allocated items of Company
        income and gain for such year in an amount equal to such Members
        share of the net decrease in Member Minimum Gain (as determined
        pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(i)(4)).  This
        section is intended to constitute a partner nonrecourse debt
        minimum gain chargeback under Treasury Regulations Section
        1.704-2(i)(4) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith.
 
        (e)                                  Notwithstanding any provision
        hereof to the contrary except Section 4.2(a) and Section 4.2(b), no
        Losses or other items of loss or expense shall be allocated to any
        Member to the extent that such allocation would cause such Member
        to have an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit (or increase any
        existing Adjusted Capital Account Deficit) at the end of such
        Fiscal Year or other taxable period.  All Losses and other items of
        loss and expense in excess of the limitation set forth in this 
        Section 4.2(e) shall be allocated to the Members who do not have an
        Adjusted Capital Account
 
28
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
        Deficit in proportion to their relative positive Capital Accounts
        but only to the extent that such Losses and other items of loss and
        expense do not cause any such Member to have an Adjusted Capital
        Account Deficit.
 
        (f)                                   Notwithstanding any provision
        hereof to the contrary except Section 4.2(c) and Section 4.2(d), in
        the event any Member unexpectedly receives any adjustment,
        allocation or distribution described in paragraph (4), (5) or (6)
        of Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d), items of
        income and gain (consisting of a pro rata portion of each item of
        income, including gross income, and gain for the Fiscal Year or
        other taxable period) shall be specially allocated to such Member
        in an amount and manner sufficient to eliminate any Adjusted
        Capital Account Deficit of that Member as quickly as possible;
        provided that an allocation pursuant to this Section 4.2(f) shall
        be made only if and to the extent that such Member would have an
        Adjusted Capital Account Deficit after all other allocations
        provided for in this Article IV have been tentatively made as if
        this Section 4.2(f) were not in this Agreement.  This Section
        4.2(f) is intended to constitute a qualified income offset under
        Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d) and shall be
        interpreted consistently therewith.
 
        (g)                                  If any Member has a deficit
        balance in its Capital Account at the end of any Fiscal Year or
        other taxable period that is in excess of the sum of (i) the amount
        that such Member is obligated to restore and (ii) the amount that
        the Member is deemed to be obligated to restore pursuant to the
        penultimate sentence of Treasury Regulations Sections 1.704-2(g)(1)
        and (i)(5), that Member shall be specially allocated items of
        Company income and gain in the amount of such excess as quickly as
        possible, provided that an allocation pursuant to this Section
        4.2(g) shall be made only if and to the extent that such Member
        would have a deficit balance in its Capital Account in excess of
        such sum after all other allocations provided for in this Article
        IV have been made as if Section 4.2(f) and this Section 4.2(g) were
        not in this Agreement.
 
        (h)                                 To the extent an adjustment to
        the adjusted tax basis of any Company asset pursuant to Code
        Sections 734(b) or 743(b) is required, pursuant to Treasury
        Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m)(2) or 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)
        (m)(4), to be taken into account in determining Capital Accounts as
        a result of a distribution to any Member in complete liquidation of
        such Members Interest in the Company, the amount of such
        adjustment to the Capital Accounts shall be treated as an item of
        gain (if the adjustment increases the basis of the asset) or loss
        (if the adjustment decreases such basis) and such item of gain or
        loss shall be allocated to the Members in accordance with Treasury
        Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m)(2) if such section applies
        or to the Member to whom such distribution was made if Treasury
        Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m)(4) applies.
 
        (i)                                     The allocations set forth
        in Sections 4.2(a) through 4.2(h) (the Regulatory Allocations)
        are intended to comply with certain requirements of Treasury
        Regulations Sections 1.704-1(b) and 1.704-2.  Notwithstanding any
        other provision of this Article IV (other than the Regulatory
        Allocations), the Regulatory Allocations (and anticipated future
        Regulatory Allocations) shall be taken into account in
 
29
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
        allocating other items of income, gain, loss and deduction among
        the Members so that, to the extent possible, the net amount of such
        allocation of other items and the Regulatory Allocations to each
        Member should be equal to the net amount that would have been
        allocated to each such Member if the Regulatory Allocations had not
        occurred.  This Section 4.2(i) is intended to minimize to the
        extent possible and to the extent necessary any economic
        distortions which may result from application of the Regulatory
        Allocations and shall be interpreted in a manner consistent
        therewith.
 
Section 4.3                                    Allocations for Tax Purposes 
in General.
 
        (a)                                 Except as otherwise provided in
        this Section 4.3, each item of income, gain, loss and deduction of
        the Company for U.S. federal income tax purposes shall be allocated
        among the Members in the same manner as such item is allocated
        under Sections 4.1 and 4.2.
 
        (b)                                 In accordance with Code Section
        704(c) and the Treasury Regulations thereunder (including the
        Treasury Regulations applying the principles of Code Section 704(c)
        to changes in Gross Asset Values), items of income, gain, loss and
        deduction with respect to any Company property having a Gross Asset
        Value that differs from such propertys adjusted U.S. federal
        income tax basis shall, solely for U.S. federal income tax
        purposes, be allocated among the Members to account for any such
        difference using the traditional method with curative
        allocations, with the curative allocations applied only to sale
        gain, under Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-3(c) or such other
        method or methods determined by the Managing Member to be
        appropriate and in accordance with the applicable Treasury
        Regulations.
 
        (c)                                  Any (i) recapture of
        depreciation or any other item of deduction shall be allocated, in
        accordance with Treasury Regulations Sections 1.1245-1(e) and
        1.1254-5, to the Members who received the benefit of such
        deductions, and (ii) recapture of grants credits shall be allocated
        to the Members in accordance with applicable law.
 
        (d)                                 Allocations pursuant to this 
        Section 4.3 are solely for purposes of U.S. federal, state and
        local taxes and shall not affect or in any way be taken into
        account in computing any Members Capital Account or share of
        Profits, Losses, other items or distributions pursuant to any
        provision of this Agreement.
 
        (e)                                  If, as a result of an exercise
        of a noncompensatory option to acquire an interest in the Company,
        a Capital Account reallocation is required under Treasury
        Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(s)(3), the Company shall make
        corrective allocations pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section
        1.704-1(b)(4)(x).
 
Section 4.4                                    Other Allocation Rules.
 
        (a)                                 The Members are aware of the
        income tax consequences of the allocations made by this Article IV 
        and the economic impact of the allocations on the amounts
        receivable by them under this Agreement.  The Members hereby agree
        to be bound by the
 
30
------------------------------------------------------------------------

         
        provisions of this Article IV in reporting their share of Company
        income and loss for income tax purposes.
 
        (b)                                 The provisions regarding the
        establishment and maintenance for each Member of a Capital Account
        as provided by Section 3.4 and the allocations set forth in 
        Sections 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 are intended to comply with the Treasury
        Regulations and to reflect the intended economic entitlement of the
        Members.  If the Managing Member determines, in its sole
        discretion, that the application of the provisions in Sections 3.4
        , 4.1, 4.2 or 4.3 would result in non-compliance with the Treasury
        Regulations or would be inconsistent with the intended economic
        entitlement of the Members, the Managing Member is authorized to
        make any appropriate adjustments to such provisions.
 
        (c)                                  All items of income, gain,
        loss, deduction and credit allocable to an interest in the Company
        that may have been Transferred shall be allocated between the
        Transferor and the Transferee based on the portion of the Fiscal
        Year or other taxable period during which each was recognized as
        the owner of such interest, in accordance with a method determined
        by the Managing Member and permissible under Code Section 706 and
        the Treasury Regulations thereunder.
 
        (d)                                 The Members proportionate
        shares of the excess nonrecourse liabilities of the Company,
        within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.752-3(a)(3),
        shall be allocated to the Members in any manner determined by the
        Managing Member and permissible under the Treasury Regulations.
 
ARTICLE V
 
DISTRIBUTIONS
 
Section 5.1                                    Distributions.
 
        (a)                                 Distributions.  To the extent
        permitted by applicable Law and hereunder, and except as otherwise
        provided in Section 10.3, distributions to Members may be declared
        by the Managing Member out of funds legally available therefor in
        such amounts and on such terms (including the payment dates of such
        distributions) as the Managing Member shall determine using such
        record date as the Managing Member may designate; any such
        distribution shall be made to the Members as of the close of
        business on such record date on a pro rata basis (except that, for
        the avoidance of doubt, repurchases or redemptions made in
        accordance with Section 3.1 or payments made in accordance with 
        Sections 6.4 or 6.9 need not be on a pro rata basis), in accordance
        with the number of Units owned by each Member as of the close of
        business on such record date; provided, however, that the Managing
        Member shall have the obligation to make distributions as set forth
        in Sections 5.2 and 10.3(b)(iii); and provided, further, that,
        notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, no
        distributions shall be made to any Member to the extent such
        distribution would render the Company insolvent or violate the Act.
         For purposes of the foregoing sentence, insolvency means the
        inability of the Company to meet its
 
31
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
        payment obligations when due.  Promptly following the designation
        of a record date and the declaration of a distribution pursuant to
        this Section 5.1, the Managing Member shall give notice to each
        Member of the record date, the amount and the terms of the
        distribution and the payment date thereof.
 
        (b)                                 Successors.  For purposes of
        determining the amount of distributions, each Member shall be
        treated as having made the Capital Contributions and as having
        received the distributions made to or received by its predecessors
        in respect of any of such Members Units.
 
        (c)                                  Distributions In-Kind.  Except
        as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any distributions may be
        made in cash or in kind, or partly in cash and partly in kind, as
        determined by the Managing Member.  To the extent that the Company
        distributes property in-kind to the Members, the Company shall be
        treated as making a distribution equal to the Fair Market Value of
        such property for purposes of Section 5.1(a) and such property
        shall be treated as if it were sold for an amount equal to its Fair
        Market Value.  Any resulting gain or loss shall be allocated to the
        Members Capital Accounts in accordance with Section 4.1 and 
        Section 4.2.
 
Section 5.2                                    Tax-Related Distributions.  
The Company shall, subject to any restrictions contained in any commercial 
agreement entered into in the ordinary course with a third party to which 
the Company is bound, make distributions out of legally available funds 
(and taking into account any cash reserves to pay costs, fees, operating 
expenses and other expenses of the Company which the Managing Member 
reasonably deems necessary) to all Members on a pro rata basis, in 
accordance with the number of Units owned by each Member, at such times and 
in such amounts as the Managing Member reasonably determines is necessary 
to enable PubCo to (i) timely satisfy all of its U.S. federal, state and 
local and non-U.S. tax liabilities and (ii) timely meet its obligations 
pursuant to any and all Tax Receivable Agreements.
 
Section 5.3                                    Distribution Upon Withdrawal
.  No withdrawing Member shall be entitled to receive any distribution or 
the value of such Members Interest in the Company as a result of 
withdrawal from the Company prior to the liquidation of the Company, except 
as specifically provided in this Agreement.

MANAGEMENT
 
Section 6.1                                    The Managing Member; 
Fiduciary Duties.
 
        (a)                                 PubCo shall be the sole
        Managing Member of the Company.  Except as otherwise required by
        Law, (i) the Managing Member shall have full and complete charge of
        all affairs of the Company, (ii) the management and control of the
        Companys business activities and operations shall rest exclusively
        with the Managing Member, and the Managing Member shall make all
        decisions regarding the business, activities and operations of the
        Company (including the incurrence of costs and expenses) in its
        sole discretion without the consent of any other Member and (iii)
        the Members
 
32
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
        other than the Managing Member (in their capacity as such) shall
        not participate in the control, management, direction or operation
        of the activities or affairs of the Company and shall have no power
        to act for or bind the Company.
 
        (b)                                 In connection with the
        performance of its duties as the Managing Member of the Company,
        except as otherwise set forth herein, the Managing Member
        acknowledges that it will owe to the Members the same fiduciary
        duties as it would owe to the stockholders of a Delaware
        corporation if it were a member of the board of directors of such a
        corporation and the Members were stockholders of such corporation. 
        The Members acknowledge that the Managing Member will take action
        through its board of directors, and that the members of the
        Managing Members board of directors will owe comparable fiduciary
        duties to the stockholders of the Managing Member.  The provisions
        of this Agreement, to the extent that they restrict or eliminate
        the duties (including fiduciary duties) and liabilities of the
        Managing Member otherwise existing at law or in equity, are agreed
        by the Members to replace, to the fullest extent permitted by
        applicable Law, such other duties and liabilities of the Managing
        Member.
 
Section 6.2                                    Officers.
 
        (a)                                 The Managing Member may
        appoint, employ or otherwise contract with any Person for the
        transaction of the business of the Company or the performance of
        services for or on behalf of the Company, and the Managing Member
        may delegate to any such Persons such authority to act on behalf of
        the Company as the Managing Member may from time to time deem
        appropriate.
 
        (b)                                 The initial president and chief
        executive officer of the Company (the President and Chief
        Executive Officer) will be Scott Bender.
 
        (c)                                  Except as otherwise set forth
        herein, the President and Chief Executive Officer will be
        responsible for the general and active management of the business
        of the Company and its Subsidiaries and will see that all orders of
        the Managing Member are carried into effect.  The President and
        Chief Executive Officer will report to the Managing Member and have
        the general powers and duties of management usually vested in the
        office of president and chief executive officer of a corporation
        organized under the DGCL, subject to the terms of this Agreement,
        and will have such other powers and duties as may be prescribed by
        the Managing Member or this Agreement.  The President and Chief
        Executive Officer will have the power to execute bonds, mortgages
        and other contracts requiring a seal, under the seal of the
        Company, except where required or permitted by Law to be otherwise
        signed and executed, and except where the signing and execution
        thereof will be expressly delegated by the Managing Member to some
        other Officer or agent of the Company.
 
        (d)                                 Except as set forth herein, the
        Managing Member may appoint Officers at any time, and the Officers
        may include one or more vice presidents, a secretary, one or more
        assistant secretaries, a chief financial officer, a general
        counsel, a treasurer, one or more assistant treasurers, a chief
        operating officer, an executive chairman, and any
 
33
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
        other officers that the Managing Member deems appropriate.  Except
        as set forth herein, the Officers will serve at the pleasure of the
        Managing Member, subject to all rights, if any, of such Officer
        under any contract of employment.  Any individual may hold any
        number of offices, and an Officer may, but need not, be a Member of
        the Company.  The Officers will exercise such powers and perform
        such duties as specified in this Agreement or as determined from
        time to time by the Managing Member.
 
        (e)                                  Subject to this Agreement and
        to the rights, if any, of an Officer under a contract of
        employment, any Officer may be removed, either with or without
        cause, by the Managing Member.  Any Officer may resign at any time
        by giving written notice to the Managing Member.  Any resignation
        will take effect at the date of the receipt of that notice or at
        any later time specified in that notice; and, unless otherwise
        specified in that notice, the acceptance of the resignation will
        not be necessary to make it effective.  Any resignation is without
        prejudice to the rights, if any, of the Company under any contract
        to which the Officer is a party.  A vacancy in any office because
        of death, resignation, removal, disqualification or any other cause
        will be filled in the manner prescribed in this Agreement for
        regular appointments to that office.
 
Section 6.3                                    Warranted Reliance by 
Officers on Others.  In exercising their authority and performing their 
duties under this Agreement, the Officers shall be entitled to rely on 
information, opinions, reports, or statements of the following Persons or 
groups unless they have actual knowledge concerning the matter in question 
that would cause such reliance to be unwarranted:
 
        (a)                                 one or more employees or other
        agents of the Company or subordinates whom the Officer reasonably
        believes to be reliable and competent in the matters presented; and
 
        (b)                                 any attorney, public
        accountant, or other Person as to matters which the Officer
        reasonably believes to be within such Persons professional or
        expert competence.
 
Section 6.4                                    Indemnification.  Subject to 
the limitations and conditions provided in this Section 6.4, each Person 
who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is 
involved in any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or 
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or arbitrative (each, a 
Proceeding), or any appeal in such a Proceeding or any inquiry or 
investigation that could lead to such a Proceeding, by reason of the fact 
he, she or it, or a Person of which he, she or it is the legal 
representative, is or was a Member, an Officer, or acting as the, Managing 
Member, Tax Matters Member or Company Representative of the Company, in 
each case, shall be indemnified by the Company to the fullest extent 
permitted by applicable Law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended 
(but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such 
amendment permits the Company to provide broader indemnification rights 
than such Law permitted the Company to provide prior to such amendment) 
against all judgment, penalties (including excise and similar taxes and 
punitive damages), fines, settlement and reasonable expenses (including 
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) actually incurred by such Person 
in connection with such Proceeding, appeal, inquiry or investigation, if 
such Person acted in
 
34
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Good Faith.  Reasonable expenses incurred by a Person of the type entitled 
to be indemnified under this Section 6.4 who was, is or is threatened to be 
made a named defendant or respondent in a Proceeding shall be paid by the 
Company in advance of the final disposition of the Proceeding upon receipt 
of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Person to repay such amount if it 
shall ultimately be determined that he, she or it is not entitled to be 
indemnified by the Company.  Indemnification under this Section 6.4 shall 
continue as to a Person who has ceased to serve in the capacity which 
initially entitled such Person to indemnity hereunder.  The rights granted 
pursuant to this Section 6.4 shall be deemed contract rights, and no 
amendment, modification or repeal of this Section 6.4 shall have the effect 
of limiting or denying any such rights with respect to actions taken or 
Proceedings, appeals, inquiries or investigations arising prior to any 
amendment, modification or repeal.  It is expressly acknowledged that the 
indemnification provided in this Section 6.4 could involve indemnification 
for negligence or under theories of strict liability.
 
Section 6.5                                    Maintenance of Insurance or 
Other Financial Arrangements.  In compliance with applicable Law, the 
Company (with the approval of the Managing Member) may purchase and 
maintain insurance or make other financial arrangements on behalf of any 
Person who is or was a Member, employee or agent of the Company, or at the 
request of the Company is or was serving as a manager, director, officer, 
employee or agent of another limited liability company, corporation, 
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, for any Liability 
asserted against such Person and Liability and expenses incurred by such 
Person in such Persons capacity as such, or arising out of such Persons 
status as such, whether or not the Company has the authority to indemnify 
such Person against such Liability and expenses.
 
Section 6.6                                    Resignation or Termination 
of Managing Member.  PubCo shall not, by any means, resign as, cease to be 
or be replaced as Managing Member except in compliance with this Section 
6.6.  No termination or replacement of PubCo as Managing Member shall be 
effective unless proper provision is made, in compliance with this 
Agreement, so that the obligations of PubCo, its successor (if applicable) 
and any new Managing Member and the rights of all Members under this 
Agreement and applicable Law remain in full force and effect.  No 
appointment of a Person other than PubCo (or its successor, as applicable) 
as Managing Member shall be effective unless PubCo (or its successor, as 
applicable) and the new Managing Member (as applicable) provide all other 
Members with contractual rights, directly enforceable by such other Members 
against PubCo (or its successor, as applicable) and the new Managing Member 
(as applicable), to cause (a) PubCo to comply with all PubCos obligations 
under this Agreement (including its obligations under Section 3.6) other 
than those that must necessarily be taken in its capacity as Managing 
Member and (b) the new Managing Member to comply with all the Managing 
Members obligations under this Agreement.
 
Section 6.7                                    No Inconsistent Obligations
.  The Managing Member represents that it does not have any contracts, 
other agreements, duties or obligations that are inconsistent with its 
duties and obligations (whether or not in its capacity as Managing Member) 
under this Agreement and covenants that, except as permitted by Section 6.1
, it will not enter into any contracts or other agreements or undertake or 
acquire any other duties or obligations that are inconsistent with such 
duties and obligations.
 
Section 6.8                                    Reclassification Events of 
PubCo.  If a Reclassification Event occurs, the Managing Member or its 
successor, as the case may be, shall, as and to the extent necessary, amend
 
35
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
this Agreement in compliance with Section 11.1, and enter into any 
necessary supplementary or additional agreements, to ensure that, following 
the effective date of the Reclassification Event: (i) the redemption rights 
of holders of Units set forth in Section 3.6 provide that each Unit 
(together with the transfer and surrender of one share of Class B Stock) is 
redeemable for the same amount and same type of property, securities or 
cash (or combination thereof) that one share of Class A Common Stock 
becomes exchangeable for or converted into as a result of the 
Reclassification Event and (ii) PubCo or the successor to PubCo, as 
applicable, is obligated to deliver such property, securities or cash upon 
such redemption.  PubCo shall not consummate or agree to consummate any 
Reclassification Event unless the successor Person, if any, becomes 
obligated to comply with the obligations of PubCo (in whatever capacity) 
under this Agreement.
 
Section 6.9                                    Certain Costs and Expenses.  
The Company shall (i) pay, or cause to be paid, all costs, fees, operating 
expenses and other expenses of the Company (including the costs, fees and 
expenses of attorneys, accountants or other professionals and the 
compensation of all personnel providing services to the Company) incurred 
in pursuing and conducting, or otherwise related to, the activities of the 
Company, and (ii) in the sole discretion of the Managing Member, reimburse 
the Managing Member for any costs, fees or expenses incurred by it in 
connection with serving as the Managing Member.  To the extent that the 
Managing Member determines in its sole discretion that such expenses are 
related to the business and affairs of the Managing Member that are 
conducted through the Company and/or its Subsidiaries (including expenses 
that relate to the business and affairs of the Company and/or its 
Subsidiaries and that also relate to other activities of the Managing 
Member), the Managing Member shall cause the Company to pay or bear all 
expenses of the Managing Member, including, without limitation, costs of 
securities offerings not borne directly by Members, board of directors 
compensation and meeting costs, costs of periodic reports to its 
stockholders, litigation costs and damages arising from litigation, 
accounting and legal costs; provided that the Company shall not pay or bear 
any income tax obligations of the Managing Member or bear the cost of 
payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement.  For the avoidance of doubt, 
any payments made to or on behalf of the Managing Member pursuant to this 
Section 6.9 shall not be treated as a distribution pursuant to Section 
5.1(a) but shall instead be treated as a cost or an expense of the Company.
 
ARTICLE VII
 
ROLE OF MEMBERS
 
Section 7.1                                    Rights or Powers.  Other 
than the Managing Member, the Members, acting in their capacity as Members, 
shall not have any right or power to take part in the management or control 
of the Company or its business and affairs or to act for or bind the 
Company in any way.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Members have all 
the rights and powers specifically set forth in this Agreement and, to the 
extent not inconsistent with this Agreement, in the Act.  A Member, any 
Affiliate thereof or an employee, stockholder, agent, director or officer 
of a Member or any Affiliate thereof, may also be an employee or be 
retained as an agent of the Company.  The existence of these relationships 
and acting in such capacities will not result in the Member (other than the 
Managing Member) being deemed to be participating in the control of the 
business of the Company or otherwise affect the limited liability of the 
Member.  Except as specifically provided herein, a Member (other than the 
Managing Member) shall not, in its capacity as a Member, take
 
36
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
part in the operation, management or control of the Companys business, 
transact any business in the Companys name or have the power to sign 
documents for or otherwise bind the Company

        (a)                                 Meetings of the Members may be
        called upon the written request of Members holding at least 50% of
        the outstanding Units.  Such request shall state the location of
        the meeting and the nature of the business to be transacted at the
        meeting.  Written notice of any such meeting shall be given to all
        Members not less than two Business Days and not more than 30 days
        prior to the date of such meeting.  Members may vote in person, by
        proxy or by telephone at any meeting of the Members and may waive
        advance notice of such meeting.  Whenever the vote or consent of
        Members is permitted or required under this Agreement, such vote or
        consent may be given at a meeting of the Members or may be given in
        accordance with the procedure prescribed in this Section 7.2. 
        Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, the
        affirmative vote of the Members holding a majority of the
        outstanding Units shall constitute the act of the Members.
 
        (b)                                 Each Member may authorize any
        Person or Persons to act for it by proxy on all matters in which
        such Member is entitled to participate, including waiving notice of
        any meeting, or voting or participating at a meeting.  Every proxy
        must be signed by such Member or its attorney-in-fact.  No proxy
        shall be valid after the expiration of 11 months from the date
        thereof unless otherwise provided in the proxy.  Every proxy shall
        be revocable at the pleasure of the Member executing it.
 
        (c)                                  Each meeting of Members shall
        be conducted by an Officer designated by the Managing Member or
        such other individual Person as the Managing Member deems
        appropriate.
 
        (d)                                 Any action required or
        permitted to be taken by the Members may be taken without a meeting
        if the requisite Members whose approval is necessary consent
        thereto in writing.
 
Section 7.3                                    Various Capacities.  The 
Members acknowledge and agree that the Members or their Affiliates will 
from time to time act in various capacities, including as a Member and as 
the Tax Matters Member or Company Representative.
 
Section 7.4                                    Business Opportunities.
 
        (a)                                 To the fullest extent permitted
        by Law, the Company, on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries,
        renounces any interest or expectancy of the Company and its
        Subsidiaries in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate
        in, any business opportunities that are from time to time presented
        to Cadent Energy Partners II, L.P. and its Affiliates (the 
        Sponsor) or any of their respective Affiliates or any of their
        respective agents, shareholders, members, partners, directors,
        officers, employees, Affiliates or Subsidiaries (other than the
        Company and its Subsidiaries), including any officer of the Company
        who is also an agent, shareholder, member, partner, director,
        officer, employee, Affiliate or Subsidiary of the Sponsor (each, a
        Business
 
37
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
        Opportunities Exempt Party), even if the business opportunity is
        one that the Company or its Subsidiaries might reasonably be deemed
        to have pursued or had the ability or desire to pursue if granted
        the opportunity to do so, and no Business Opportunities Exempt
        Party shall have any duty to communicate or offer any such business
        opportunity to the Company or be liable to the Company or any of
        its Subsidiaries or any Members, including for breach of any
        fiduciary or other duty, as an officer or Member or otherwise, and
        the Company shall indemnify each Business Opportunities Exempt
        Party against any claim that such Person is liable to the Company
        or the Members for breach of any fiduciary duty, by reason of the
        fact that such Person (i) participates in, pursues or acquires any
        such business opportunity, (ii) directs any such business
        opportunity to another Person or (iii) fails to present any such
        business opportunity, or information regarding any such business
        opportunity, to the Company or its Subsidiaries, unless, in the
        case of a Person who is an officer of the Company, such business
        opportunity is expressly offered to such officer in writing solely
        in his capacity as an officer of the Company.
 
        (b)                                 To the fullest extent permitted
        by Law, no Business Opportunity Exempt Party shall have any duty to
        refrain from directly or indirectly (i) engaging in the same or
        similar business activities or lines of business in which the
        Company or any of its Affiliates now engages or proposes to engage
        or (ii) otherwise competing with the Company or any of its
        Affiliates, and, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, no
        Business Opportunity Exempt Party shall be liable to the Company or
        the Members or to any Affiliate of the Company for breach of any
        fiduciary duty solely by reason of the fact that such Business
        Opportunity Exempt Party engages in any such activities.
 
ARTICLE VIII
 
TRANSFERS OF INTERESTS
 
Section 8.1                                    Restrictions on Transfer.
 
        (a)                                 Except as provided in Section
        3.6 and except for Transfers by HoldCo to its members pursuant to
        Section 8.3 of the A&R Holdco Agreement, no Member shall Transfer
        all or any portion of its Interest without the Managing Members
        prior written consent, which consent shall be granted or withheld
        in the Managing Members reasonable discretion.  If,
        notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8.1(a), all or any
        portion of a Members Interests are Transferred in violation of
        this Section 8.1(a), involuntarily, by operation of law or
        otherwise, then without limiting any other rights and remedies
        available to the other parties under this Agreement or otherwise,
        the Transferee of such Interest (or portion thereof) shall not be
        admitted to the Company as a Member or be entitled to any rights as
        a Member hereunder, and the Transferor will continue to be bound by
        all obligations hereunder, unless and until the Managing Member
        consents in writing to such admission, which consent shall be
        granted or withheld in the Managing Members sole discretion.  Any
        attempted or purported Transfer of all or a portion of a Members
        Interests in violation of this Section 8.1(a) shall be null and
        void and of no force or effect
 
38
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
        whatsoever.  For the avoidance of doubt, the restrictions on
        Transfer contained in this Article VIII shall not apply to the
        Transfer of any capital stock of the Managing Member; provided 
        that no shares of Class B Common Stock may be Transferred unless a
        corresponding number of Units are Transferred therewith in
        accordance with this Agreement.
 
        (b)           In addition to any other restrictions on Transfer
        contained herein, including the provisions of this Article VIII, in
        no event may any Transfer or assignment of Interests by any Member
        be made (i) to any Person who lacks the legal right, power or
        capacity to own Interests; (ii) unless, if requested by the
        Company, the Transferor has received a written opinion in form and
        substance that is reasonably acceptable to the Company from legal
        counsel or a qualified tax advisor (in either case who is
        reasonably acceptable to the Company) to the effect that such
        Transfer (A) will not be considered to be effected on or through an
        established securities market or a secondary market or the
        substantial equivalent thereof, as such terms are used in Treasury
        Regulations Section 1.7704-1, (B) will not result in the Company
        having more than one hundred (100) partners, within the meaning of
        Treasury Regulations Section 1.7704-1(h)(1) (determined taking into
        account the rules of Treasury Regulations Section 1.7704-1(h)(3)),
        and (C) will not cause the Company to be treated as a publicly
        traded partnership within the meaning of Section 7704 of the Code
        or a successor provision or to be taxed as a corporation pursuant
        to the Code or successor of the Code; (iii) if such Transfer would
        cause the Company to become, with respect to any employee benefit
        plan subject to Title I of ERISA, a party-in-interest (as defined
        in Section 3 (14) of ERISA) or a disqualified person (as defined
        in Section 4975(e)(2) of the Code); (iv) if such Transfer would, in
        the opinion of counsel to the Company, cause any portion of the
        assets of the Company to constitute assets of any employee benefit
        plan pursuant to the Plan Asset Regulations or otherwise cause the
        Company to be subject to regulation under ERISA; (v) if such
        Transfer requires the registration of such Interests or any Equity
        Securities issued upon any exchange of such Interests, pursuant to
        any applicable U.S. federal or state securities Laws; or (vi) if
        such Transfer subjects the Company to regulation under the
        Investment Company Act or the Investment Advisors Act of 1940, each
        as amended (or any succeeding law). Any Transfer purported to be
        made in violation of this Section 8.1(b) shall be void ab initio.

 
Section 8.2                                    Notice of Transfer.  Other 
than in connection with Transfers made pursuant to Section 3.6, each Member 
shall, after complying with the provisions of this Agreement, but in any 
event no later than three Business Days following any Transfer of 
Interests, give written notice to the Company of such Transfer.  Each such 
notice shall describe the manner and circumstances of the Transfer.

Section 9.5                                    Withholding Tax Payments and 
Obligations.
 
        (a)                                 The Company and its
        Subsidiaries may withhold from distributions, allocations or
        portions thereof if it is required to do so by any applicable rule,
        regulation or law, and each Member hereby authorizes the Company
        and its Subsidiaries to withhold or pay on behalf of or with
        respect to such Member any amount of taxes that the Managing Member
        determines, in good faith, that the Company or any of its
        Subsidiaries is required to withhold or pay with respect to any
        amount distributable or allocable to such Member pursuant to this
        Agreement.
 
        (b)                                 To the extent that any tax is
        paid by (or withheld from amounts payable to) the Company or any of
        its Subsidiaries and the Managing Member determines, in good faith,
        that such tax relates to one or more specific Members (including
        any tax payable by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant
        to Section 6225 of the Code with respect to items of income, gain,
        loss deduction or credit allocable or attributable to such Member),
        such tax shall be treated as an amount of taxes withheld or paid
        with respect to such Member pursuant to this Section 9.5.
 
        (c)                                  For all purposes under this
        Agreement, any amounts withheld or paid with respect to a Member
        pursuant to this Section 9.5 shall be treated as if distributed to
        such Member at the time such withholding or payment is made. 
        Further, to the extent that the cumulative amount of such
        withholding or payment for any period exceeds the distributions to
        which such Member is entitled for such period, the amount of such
        excess shall be considered a loan from the Company to such Member,
        with interest accruing at the Prime Rate in effect from time to
        time, compounded annually.  The Managing Member may, in its
        discretion, either demand payment of the principal and accrued
        interest on such demand loan at any time (which payment shall not
        be deemed a Capital Contribution for purposes of this Agreement),
        and enforce payment thereof by legal process, or may withhold from
        one or more distributions to a Member amounts sufficient to satisfy
        such Members obligations under any such demand loan.
 
        (d)                                 Neither the Company nor the
        Managing Member shall be liable for any excess taxes withheld in
        respect of any Member, and, in the event of overwithholding, a
        Members sole recourse shall be to apply for a refund from the
        appropriate Governmental Entity.
 
        (e)                                  Notwithstanding any other
        provision of this Agreement, (i) any Person who ceases to be a
        Member shall be treated as a Member for purposes of this Section
        9.5 and (ii) the obligations of a Member pursuant to this Section
        9.5 shall survive indefinitely with respect to any taxes withheld
        or paid by the Company that relate to the period
 
42
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
        during which such Person was actually a Member, regardless of
        whether such taxes are assessed, withheld or otherwise paid during
        such period.

reorganization, arrangements, readjustment of debt, dissolution, 
liquidation or similar proceedings shall be instituted (by petition, 
application or otherwise) against that Member and shall remain undismissed
