2. 	Company Registration
 
    (a)    On or prior to each Filing Date, the Company shall prepare and
    file with the Commission a Registration Statement covering the resale
    of all Registrable Securities for an offering to be made on a
    continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415. The Registration Statement shall
    be on Form S-1 or, if the Company is so eligible, on Form S-3 (except
    if the Company is not then eligible to register for resale the
    Registrable Securities on Form S-1 or Form S-3, as the case may be, in
    which case such registration shall be on another appropriate form in
    accordance herewith) and shall contain substantially the “Plan of
    Distribution” attached hereto as Annex A. Subject to the terms of this
    Agreement, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause a
    Registration Statement to be declared effective under the Securities
    Act as promptly as possible after the filing thereof, but in any event
    prior to the applicable Effectiveness Date, and shall use its
    reasonable best efforts to keep such Registration Statement
    continuously effective under the Securities Act until all Registrable
    Securities covered by such Registration Statement have been sold, or
    may be sold without volume restrictions, notice or manner of sale
    requirements pursuant to Rule 144, including without limitation 144(i),
    as determined by the counsel to the Company pursuant to a written
    opinion letter to such effect, addressed and reasonably acceptable to
    the Transfer Agent and the affected Holders that such securities may be
    sold without registration and may be issued without legends thereon
    (the “Effectiveness Period”). The Company shall telephonically request
    effectiveness of a Registration Statement as of 5:00 p.m. New York City
    time on a Trading Day. The Company shall immediately notify the Holders
    via facsimile or by e-mail of the effectiveness of a Registration
    Statement on the same Trading Day that the Company telephonically
    confirms effectiveness with the Commission, which shall be the date
    requested for effectiveness of such Registration Statement. The Company
    shall, by 9:30
    a.m. New York City time on the Trading Day after the effective date of
    such Registration Statement, file a final Prospectus with the
    Commission as required by Rule 424. Failure to so notify the Holder
    within 1 Trading Day of such notification of effectiveness or failure
    to file a final Prospectus as foresaid shall be deemed an Event under
    Section 2(b).
 
    (b)    If: (i) the Registration Statement is not filed on or prior to
    its Filing Date (if the Company files the Registration Statement
    without affording the Holders the opportunity to review and comment on
    the same as required by Section 3(a) herein, the Company shall be
    deemed to have not satisfied this clause (i)), or (ii) the Company
    fails to file with the Commission a request for acceleration of a
    Registration Statement in accordance with Rule 461 promulgated by the
    Commission pursuant to the Securities Act, within five Trading Days of
    the date that the Company is notified (orally or in writing, whichever
    is earlier) by the Commission that such Registration Statement will not
    be “reviewed” or will not be subject to further review, or (iii) prior
    to the effective date of a Registration Statement, the Company fails to
    file a pre-effective amendment and otherwise respond in writing to
    comments made by the Commission in respect of such
     
  	3 	 

 
     
    Registration Statement within 15 calendar days after the receipt of
    comments by or notice from the Commission that such amendment is
    required in order for such Registration Statement to be declared
    effective, or (iv) as to, in the aggregate among all Holders on a
    pro-rata basis based on their purchase of the Securities pursuant to
    the Purchase Agreement, a Registration Statement registering for resale
    all of the Registrable Securities is not declared effective by the
    Commission by the Effectiveness Date of the Registration Statement, or
    (v) all of the Registrable Securities are not registered for resale
    pursuant to one or more effective Registration Statements on or before
    the Effectiveness Date (except as may be limited by the Commission
    pursuant to its authority with respect to “Rule 415”), or (vi) after
    the effective date of a Registration Statement, such Registration
    Statement ceases for any reason to remain continuously effective as to
    all Registrable Securities included in such Registration Statement, or
    the Holders are otherwise not permitted to utilize the Prospectus
    therein to resell such Registrable Securities, for more than 10
    consecutive calendar days or more than an aggregate of 20 calendar days
    (which need not be consecutive calendar days) during any 12-month
    period (any such failure or breach being referred to as an “Event”, and
    for purposes of clause (i), (iv) and (v) the date on which such Event
    occurs, and for purpose of clause (ii) the date on which such five
    Trading Day period is exceeded, and for purpose of clause (iii) the
    date which such 10 calendar day period is exceeded, and for purpose of
    clause (vi) the date on which such 10 or 20 calendar day period, as
    applicable, is exceeded being referred to as “Event Date”), then, in
    addition to any other rights the Holders may have hereunder or under
    applicable law, on each such Event Date and on each monthly anniversary
    of each such Event Date (if the applicable Event shall not have been
    cured by such date) until the applicable Event is cured, the Company
    shall pay to each Holder an amount in cash, as partial liquidated
    damages and not as a penalty, equal to 1.5% of the aggregate purchase
    price paid by such Holder pursuant to the Purchase Agreement for any
    unregistered Registrable Securities then held by such Holder, up to a
    maximum of 24% of the Purchase Price of such Purchaser’s Notes. The
    partial liquidated damages pursuant to the terms hereof shall apply on
    a daily pro rata basis for any portion of a month prior to the cure of
    an Event. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be
    required to make any payments pursuant to this Section if an Event
    occurred at such time that all Registrable Securities are eligible for
    resale pursuant to Rule 144 (without volume restrictions or current
    public information requirements) promulgated by the Commission pursuant
    to the Securities Act; provided, further, that the Company shall not be
    required to make any payments pursuant to this Section with respect to
    any Registrable Securities the Company is unable to register due to
    limits imposed by the SEC Guidance on Rule 415 under the Securities
    Act.
 
    (c)    Notwithstanding the registration obligations set forth in this
    Section, if the Commission informs the Company that all of the
    Registrable Securities cannot, as a result of the application of Rule
    415, be registered for resale as a secondary offering on a single
    registration statement, the Company agrees to promptly inform each of
    the Holders thereof and use its commercially reasonable efforts to file
    amendments to the Registration Statement as required by the Commission,
    covering the maximum number of Registrable Securities permitted to be
    registered by the Commission, on Form S-3 or such other form available
    to register for resale the Registrable Securities as a secondary
    offering;
     
  	4 	 

 
     
    provided, however, that prior to filing such amendment, the Company
    shall be obligated to use diligent efforts to advocate with the
    Commission for the registration of all of the Registrable Securities in
    accordance with the SEC Guidance, including without limitation,
    Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation 612.09.
 
    (d)    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if the
    Commission or any SEC Guidance sets forth a limitation on the number of
    Registrable Securities permitted to be registered on a particular
    Registration Statement as a secondary offering (and notwithstanding
    that the Company used diligent efforts to advocate with the Commission
    for the registration of all or a greater portion of Registrable
    Securities), unless otherwise directed in writing by a Holder as to its
    Registrable Securities, the number of Registrable Securities to be
    registered on such Registration Statement will be reduced by
    Registrable Securities represented by Conversion Shares, as defined in
    the Note (applied, in the case that some Conversion Shares may be
    registered, to the Holders on a pro rata basis based on the total
    number of unregistered Conversion Shares held by such Holders. In the
    event of a cutback hereunder, the Company shall give the Holder at
    least 5 Trading Days prior written notice along with the calculations
    as to such Holder’s allotment.
 
    (e)    In the event of a cutback hereunder, the Company shall give the
    Holder at least five (5) Trading Days prior written notice along with
    the calculations as to such Holder’s allotment. In the event the
    Company amends the Initial Registration Statement in accordance with
    the foregoing, the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to file
    with the Commission, as promptly as allowed by the Commission or SEC
    Guidance provided to the Company or to registrants of securities in
    general, one or more registration statements on Form S-3 or such other
    form available to register for resale those Registrable Securities that
    were not registered for resale on the Initial Registration Statement,
    as amended.
 
3. 	Registration Procedures.
 
     In connection with the Company’s registration obligations hereunder,
     the Company shall:
 
    (a)    Not less than 5 Trading Days prior to the filing of each
    Registration Statement and not less than one Trading Day prior to the
    filing of any related Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto
    (including any document that would be incorporated or deemed to be
    incorporated therein by reference), the Company shall (i) furnish to
    each Holder copies of all such documents proposed to be filed, which
    documents (other than those incorporated or deemed to be incorporated
    by reference) will be subject to the review of such Holders and (ii)
    cause its officers and directors, counsel and independent certified
    public accountants to respond to such inquiries as shall be necessary,
    in the reasonable opinion of respective counsel to each Holder, to
    conduct a reasonable investigation within the meaning of the Securities
    Act. The Company shall not file a Registration Statement or any such
    Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto to which the
    Holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities shall
     
  	5 	 

 
     
    reasonably object in good faith, provided that the Company is notified
    of such objection in writing no later than 5 Trading Days after the
    Holders have been so furnished copies of a Registration Statement or 1
    Trading Day after the Holders have been so furnished copies of any
    related Prospectus or amendments or supplements thereto. No selling
    stockholders other than the Purchaser, and no securities other than
    those held by the Purchase, shall be included in and covered by the
    Registration Statement without the prior written consent of the
    Purchaser, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.
 
    (b)    (i) Prepare and file with the Commission such amendments,
    including post-effective amendments, to a Registration Statement and
    the Prospectus used in connection therewith as may be necessary to keep
    a Registration Statement continuously effective as to the applicable
    Registrable Securities for the Effectiveness Period and prepare and
    file with the Commission such additional Registration Statements in
    order to register for resale under the Securities Act all of the
    Registrable Securities; (ii) cause the related Prospectus to be amended
    or supplemented by any required Prospectus supplement (subject to the
    terms of this Agreement), and, as so supplemented or amended, to be
    filed pursuant to Rule 424; (iii) respond as promptly as reasonably
    possible to any comments received from the Commission with respect to a
    Registration Statement or any amendment thereto and provide as promptly
    as reasonably possible to the Holders true and complete copies of all
    correspondence from and to the Commission relating to a Registration
    Statement (provided that the Company may excise any information
    contained therein which would constitute material non-public
    information as to any Holder which has not executed a confidentiality
    agreement with the Company); and (iv) comply in all material respects
    with the provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act with
    respect to the disposition of all Registrable Securities covered by a
    Registration Statement during the applicable period in accordance
    (subject to the terms of this Agreement) with the intended methods of
    disposition by the Holders thereof set forth in such Registration
    Statement as so amended or in such Prospectus as so supplemented.
 
    (c)    If during the Effectiveness Period, the number of Registrable
    Securities at any time exceeds 100% of the number of shares of Common
    Stock then registered in a Registration Statement, then the Company
    shall file as soon as reasonably practicable, but in any case prior to
    the applicable Filing Date, an additional Registration Statement
    covering the resale by the Holders of not less than the number of such
    Registrable Securities.
 
    (d)    Notify the Holders of Registrable Securities to be sold (which
    notice shall, pursuant to clauses (iii) through (vi) hereof, be
    accompanied by an instruction to suspend the use of the Prospectus
    until the requisite changes have been made) as promptly as reasonably
    possible (and, in the case of (i)(A) below, not less than one Trading
    Day prior to such filing) and (if requested by any such Person) confirm
    such notice in writing no later than one Trading Day following the day
    (i)(A) when a Prospectus or any Prospectus supplement or post-effective
    amendment to a Registration Statement is proposed to be filed; (B) when
    the Commission notifies the Company whether there will be a “review” of
    such Registration Statement and whenever the Commission comments in
    writing on such Registration Statement; and (C) with respect to a
    Registration Statement or any
     
  	6 	 

 
     
    post-effective amendment, when the same has become effective; (ii) of
    any request by the Commission or any other federal or state
    governmental authority for amendments or supplements to a Registration
    Statement or Prospectus or for additional information; (iii) of the
    issuance by the Commission or any other federal or state governmental
    authority of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of a
    Registration Statement covering any or all of the Registrable
    Securities or the initiation of any Proceedings for that purpose; (iv)
    of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the
    suspension of the qualification or exemption from qualification of any
    of the Registrable Securities for sale in any jurisdiction, or the
    initiation or threatening of any Proceeding for such purpose; (v) of
    the occurrence of any event or passage of time that makes the financial
    statements included in a Registration Statement ineligible for
    inclusion therein or any statement made in a Registration Statement or
    Prospectus or any document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated
    therein by reference untrue in any material respect or that requires
    any revisions to a Registration Statement, Prospectus or other
    documents so that, in the case of a Registration Statement or the
    Prospectus, as the case may be, it will not contain any untrue
    statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
    required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
    therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
    misleading; and (vi) of the occurrence or existence of any pending
    corporate development with respect to the Company that the Company
    believes may be material and that, in the determination of the Company,
    makes it not in the best interest of the Company to allow continued
    availability of a Registration Statement or Prospectus, provided that
    any and all of such information shall remain confidential to each
    Holder until such information otherwise becomes public, unless
    disclosure by a Holder is required by law; provided, further, that
    notwithstanding each Holder’s agreement to keep such information
    confidential, each such Holder makes no acknowledgement that any such
    information is material, non-public information.
 
    (e)    Use its best efforts to avoid the issuance of, or, if issued,
    obtain the withdrawal of (i) any order stopping or suspending the
    effectiveness of a Registration Statement, or (ii) any suspension of
    the qualification (or exemption from qualification) of any of the
    Registrable Securities for sale in any jurisdiction, at the earliest
    practicable moment.
 
    (f)    Furnish to each Holder, without charge, at least one conformed
    copy of each such Registration Statement and each amendment thereto,
    including financial statements and schedules, all documents
    incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference to the
    extent requested by such Person, and all exhibits to the extent
    requested by such Person (including those previously furnished or
    incorporated by reference) promptly after the filing of such documents
    with the Commission; provided, that any such item which is available on
    the EDGAR system need not be furnished in physical form.
 
    (g)    Subject to the terms of this Agreement, the Company hereby
    consents to the use of such Prospectus and each amendment or supplement
    thereto by each of the selling Holders in connection with the offering
    and sale of the Registrable Securities covered by such Prospectus and
    any amendment or supplement thereto, except after the giving of any
    notice pursuant to Section 3(d).
     
  	7 	 

 
 
    (h)    The Company shall cooperate with any broker-dealer through which
    a Holder proposes to resell its Registrable Securities in effecting a
    filing with the FINRA Corporate Financing Department pursuant to FINRA
    Rule 5110, as requested by any such Holder, and the Company shall pay
    the filing fee required by such filing within 2 Business Days of
    written request therefor.
 
    (i)    Prior to any resale of Registrable Securities by a Holder, use
    its commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify or cooperate
    with the selling Holders in connection with the registration or
    qualification (or exemption from the Registration or qualification) of
    such Registrable Securities for the resale by the Holder under the
    securities or Blue Sky laws of such jurisdictions within the United
    States as any Holder reasonably requests in writing, to keep each
    registration or qualification (or exemption therefrom) effective during
    the Effectiveness Period and to do any and all other acts or things
    reasonably necessary to enable the disposition in such jurisdictions of
    the Registrable Securities covered by each Registration Statement;
    provided, that the Company shall not be required to qualify generally
    to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not then so qualified,
    subject the Company to any material tax in any such jurisdiction where
    it is not then so subject or file a general consent to service of
    process in any such jurisdiction.
 
    (j)    If requested by a Holder, cooperate with such Holders to
    facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of certificates
    representing Registrable Securities to be delivered to a transferee
    pursuant to a Registration Statement, which certificates shall be free,
    to the extent permitted by the Purchase Agreement, of all restrictive
    legends, and to enable such Registrable Securities to be in such
    denominations and registered in such names as any such Holder may
    request.
 
    (k)    Upon the occurrence of any event contemplated by Section 3(d),
    as promptly as reasonably possible under the circumstances taking into
    account the Company’s good faith assessment of any adverse consequences
    to the Company and its stockholders of the premature disclosure of such
    event, prepare a supplement or amendment, including a post-effective
    amendment, to a Registration Statement or a supplement to the related
    Prospectus or any document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated
    therein by reference, and file any other required document so that, as
    thereafter delivered, neither a Registration Statement nor such
    Prospectus will contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit
    to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
    make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
    they were made, not misleading. If the Company notifies the Holders in
    accordance with clauses (iii) through (vi) of Section 3(d) above to
    suspend the use of any Prospectus until the requisite changes to such
    Prospectus have been made, then the Holders shall suspend use of such
    Prospectus. The Company will use its best efforts to ensure that the
    use of the Prospectus may be resumed as promptly as is practicable. The
    Company shall be entitled to exercise its right under this Section 3(k)
    to suspend the availability of a Registration Statement and Prospectus,
    subject to the payment of partial liquidated damages otherwise required
    pursuant to Section 2(b), for a period not to exceed 60 calendar days
    (which need not be consecutive days) in any 12 month period.
     
  	8 	 

 
 
    (l)    Comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the
    Commission.
 
    (m)    The Company may require each selling Holder to furnish to the
    Company a certified statement as to the number of shares of Common
    Stock beneficially owned by such Holder and, if required by the
    Commission, the natural persons thereof that have voting and
    dispositive control over the shares. During any periods that the
    Company is unable to meet its obligations hereunder with respect to the
    registration of the Registrable Securities solely because any Holder
    fails to furnish such information within three Trading Days of the
    Company’s request, any liquidated damages that are accruing at such
    time as to such Holder only shall be tolled and any Event that may
    otherwise occur solely because of such delay shall be suspended as to
    such Holder only, until such information is delivered to the Company.
 
    4.                          Registration Expenses. All fees and
    expenses incident to the performance of or compliance with this
    Agreement by the Company shall be borne by the Company whether or not
    any Registrable Securities are sold pursuant to a Registration
    Statement. The Holder may withhold and offset the balance of such
    amount from the payment of its Purchase Price (as defined in the
    Purchase Agreement) at closing of the transaction described in the
    Purchase Agreement. The fees and expenses referred to in the foregoing
    sentence shall include, without limitation, (i) all registration and
    filing fees (including, without limitation, fees and expenses of the
    Company’s counsel and auditors and up to $2,500 of fees and expenses of
    a single counsel for the Holders) (A) with respect to filings made with
    the Commission, (B) with respect to filings required to be made with
    any Trading Market on which the Common Stock is then listed for
    trading, (C) in compliance with applicable state securities or Blue Sky
    laws reasonably agreed to by the Company in writing (including, without
    limitation, fees and disbursements of counsel for the Company in
    connection with Blue Sky qualifications or exemptions of the
    Registrable Securities) and (D) if not previously paid by the Company
    in connection with an Issuer Filing, with respect to any filing that
    may be required to be made by any broker through which a Holder intends
    to make sales of Registrable Securities with the FINRA pursuant to Rule
    5110, so long as the broker is receiving no more than a customary
    brokerage commission in connection with such sale, (ii) printing
    expenses (including, without limitation, expenses of printing
    certificates for Registrable Securities), (iii) messenger, telephone
    and delivery expenses, (iv) fees and disbursements of counsel for the
    Company, (v) Securities Act liability insurance, if the Company so
    desires such insurance, and (vi) fees and expenses of all other Persons
    retained by the Company in connection with the consummation of the
    transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In addition, the Company
    shall be responsible for all of its internal expenses incurred in
    connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
    this Agreement (including, without limitation, all salaries and
    expenses of its officers and employees performing legal or accounting
    duties), the expense of any annual audit and the fees and expenses
    incurred in connection with the listing of the Registrable Securities
    on any securities exchange as required hereunder. In no event shall the
    Company be responsible for any broker or similar commissions of any
    Holder or, except to the extent provided for in the Transaction
    Documents, any legal fees or other costs of the Holders.
  
  	9 	 

 
  
    similar commissions of any Holder or, except to the extent provided for
    in the Transaction Documents, any legal fees or other costs of the
    Holders.
 
5. 	Indemnification.
 
    (a)    Indemnification by the Company. The Company shall,
    notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement, indemnify and hold
    harmless each Holder, the officers, directors, members, partners,
    agents, brokers (including brokers who offer and sell Registrable
    Securities as principal as a result of a pledge or any failure to
    perform under a margin call of Common Stock), investment advisors and
    employees (and any other Persons with a functionally equivalent role of
    a Person holding such titles, notwithstanding a lack of such title or
    any other title) of each of them, each Person who controls any such
    Holder (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or
    Section 20 of the Exchange Act) and the officers, directors, members,
    shareholders, partners, agents and employees (and any other Persons
    with a functionally equivalent role of a Person holding such titles,
    notwithstanding a lack of such title or any other title) of each such
    controlling Person, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law,
    from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities,
    costs (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees) and
    expenses (collectively, “Losses”), as incurred, arising out of or
    relating to (1) any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material
    fact contained in a Registration Statement, any Prospectus or any form
    of prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto or in any
    preliminary prospectus, or arising out of or relating to any omission
    or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or
    necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of any Prospectus
    or supplement thereto, in light of the circumstances under which they
    were made) not misleading or (2) any violation or alleged violation by
    the Company of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or any state
    securities law, or any rule or regulation thereunder, in connection
    with the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, except to
    the extent, but only to the extent, that (i) such untrue statements or
    omissions are based solely upon information regarding such Holder
    furnished in writing to the Company by such Holder expressly for use
    therein, or to the extent that such information relates to such Holder
    or such Holder’s proposed method of distribution of Registrable
    Securities and was reviewed and expressly approved in writing by such
    Holder expressly for use in a Registration Statement, such Prospectus
    or in any amendment or supplement thereto (it being understood that the
    Holder has approved Annex A hereto for this purpose) or (ii) in the
    case of an occurrence of an event of the type specified in Section
    3(d)(iii)-(vi), the use by such Holder of an outdated or defective
    Prospectus after the Company has notified such Holder in writing that
    the Prospectus is outdated or defective and prior to the receipt by
    such Holder of the Advice contemplated in Section 6(d). The Company
    shall notify the Holders promptly of the institution, threat or
    assertion of any Proceeding arising from or in connection with the
    transactions contemplated by this Agreement of which the Company is
    aware.
 
    (b)    Indemnification by Holders. Each Holder shall, severally and not
    jointly, indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors,
    officers, agents and employees, each Person who controls the Company
    (within the meaning of Section 15 of the
     
  	10 	 

 
     
    Securities Act and Section 20 of the Exchange Act), and the directors,
    officers, agents or employees of such controlling Persons, to the
    fullest extent permitted by applicable law, from and against all
    Losses, as incurred, to the extent arising out of or based solely upon:
    (x) such Holder’s failure to comply with the prospectus delivery
    requirements of the Securities Act or (y) any untrue or alleged untrue
    statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement,
    any Prospectus, or in any amendment or supplement thereto or in any
    preliminary prospectus, or arising out of or relating to any omission
    or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or
    necessary to make the statements therein not misleading (i) to the
    extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or omission
    is contained in any information so furnished in writing by such Holder
    to the Company specifically for inclusion in such Registration
    Statement or such Prospectus or (ii) to the extent that such
    information relates to such Holder’s proposed method of distribution of
    Registrable Securities and was reviewed and expressly approved in
    writing by such Holder expressly for use in a Registration Statement
    (it being understood that the Holder has approved Annex A hereto for
    this purpose), such Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement
    thereto or (ii) in the case of an occurrence of an event of the type
    specified in Section 3(d)(iii)-(vi), the use by such Holder of an
    outdated or defective Prospectus after the Company has notified such
    Holder in writing that the Prospectus is outdated or defective and
    prior to the receipt by such Holder of the Advice contemplated in
    Section 6(d). In no event shall the liability of any selling Holder
    hereunder be greater in amount than the dollar amount of the net
    proceeds received by such Holder upon the sale of the Registrable
    Securities giving rise to such indemnification obligation.
 
    (c)    Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings. If any Proceeding shall
    be brought or asserted against any Person entitled to indemnity
    hereunder (an “Indemnified Party”), such Indemnified Party shall
    promptly notify the Person from whom indemnity is sought (the “
    Indemnifying Party”) in writing, and the Indemnifying Party shall have
    the right to assume the defense thereof, including the employment of
    counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and the
    payment of all fees and expenses incurred in connection with defense
    thereof; provided, that the failure of any Indemnified Party to give
    such notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations
    or liabilities pursuant to this Agreement, except (and only) to the
    extent that it shall be finally determined by a court of competent
    jurisdiction (which determination is not subject to appeal or further
    review) that such failure shall have prejudiced the Indemnifying Party.
 
    An Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in
    any such Proceeding and to participate in the defense thereof, but the
    fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such
    Indemnified Party or Parties unless: (1) the Indemnifying Party has
    agreed in writing to pay such fees and expenses; (2) the Indemnifying
    Party shall have failed promptly to assume the defense of such
    Proceeding and to employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to such
    Indemnified Party in any such Proceeding; or (3) the named parties to
    any such Proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both such
    Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, and counsel to the
    Indemnified Party shall reasonably believe that a material conflict of
    interest is likely to exist if the same counsel were to represent such
    Indemnified Party and the
     
  	11 	 

 
     
    Indemnifying Party (in which case, if such Indemnified Party notifies
    the Indemnifying Party in writing that it elects to employ separate
    counsel at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying
    Party shall not have the right to assume the defense of the Indemnified
    Party and the reasonable fees and expenses of no more than one separate
    counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnifying Party). The
    Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any settlement of any such
    Proceeding effected without its written consent, which consent shall
    not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. No Indemnifying Party shall,
    without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, effect any
    settlement of any pending Proceeding in respect of which any
    Indemnified Party is a party, unless such settlement includes an
    unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability on
    claims that are the subject matter of such Proceeding.
 
    Subject to the terms of this Agreement, all reasonable fees and
    expenses of the Indemnified Party (including reasonable fees and
    expenses to the extent incurred in connection with investigating or
    preparing to defend such Proceeding in a manner not inconsistent with
    this Section) shall be paid to the Indemnified Party, as incurred,
    within ten Trading Days of written notice thereof to the Indemnifying
    Party; provided, that the Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse
    the Indemnifying Party for that portion of such fees and expenses
    applicable to such actions for which such Indemnified Party is
    judicially determined to be not entitled to indemnification hereunder.
 
    (d)    Contribution. If the indemnification under Section 5(a) or 5(b)
    is unavailable to an Indemnified Party or insufficient to hold an
    Indemnified Party harmless for any Losses, then each Indemnifying Party
    shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified
    Party, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative
    fault of the Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party in connection
    with the actions, statements or omissions that resulted in such Losses
    as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative
    fault of such Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party shall be
    determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in
    question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a
    material fact or omission or alleged omission of a material fact, has
    been taken or made by, or relates to information supplied by, such
    Indemnifying Party or Indemnified Party, and the parties’ relative
    intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or
    prevent such action, statement or omission. The amount paid or payable
    by a party as a result of any Losses shall be deemed to include,
    subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, any reasonable
    attorneys’ or other fees or expenses incurred by such party in
    connection with any Proceeding to the extent such party would have been
    indemnified for such fees or expenses if the indemnification provided
    for in this Section was available to such party in accordance with its
    terms.
 
    The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if
    contribution pursuant to this Section 5(d) were determined by pro rata
    allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take into
    account the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately
    preceding paragraph. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section
    5(d), no Holder shall be required to contribute, in the aggregate, any
    amount in
     
  	12 	 

 
     
    excess of the amount by which the net proceeds actually received by
    such Holder from the sale of the Registrable Securities subject to the
    Proceeding exceeds the amount of any damages that such Holder has
    otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged
    untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
 
    The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section are
    in addition to any liability that the Indemnifying Parties may have to
    the Indemnified Parties.
 
6. 	Miscellaneous.
 
    (a)    Remedies. In the event of a breach by the Company or by a Holder
    of any of their respective obligations under this Agreement, each
    Holder or the Company, as the case may be, in addition to being
    entitled to exercise all rights granted by law and under this
    Agreement, including recovery of damages, shall be entitled to specific
    performance of its rights under this Agreement. The Company and each
    Holder agree that monetary damages would not provide adequate
    compensation for any losses incurred by reason of a breach by it of any
    of the provisions of this Agreement and hereby further agrees that, in
    the event of any action for specific performance in respect of such
    breach, it shall not assert or shall waive the defense that a remedy at
    law would be adequate.
 
    (b)    Compliance. Each Holder covenants and agrees that it will comply
    with the prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act as
    applicable to it in connection with sales of Registrable Securities
    pursuant to a Registration Statement.
 
    (c)    Discontinued Disposition. By its acquisition of Registrable
    Securities, each Holder agrees that, upon receipt of a notice from the
    Company of the occurrence of any event of the kind described in Section
    3(d)(iii) through (vi), such Holder will forthwith discontinue
    disposition of such Registrable Securities under a Registration
    Statement until it is advised in writing (the “Advice”) by the Company
    that the use of the applicable Prospectus (as it may have been
    supplemented or amended) may be resumed. The Company will use its best
    efforts to ensure that the use of the Prospectus may be resumed as
    promptly as is practicable. The Company agrees and acknowledges that
    any periods during which the Holder is required to discontinue the
    disposition of the Registrable Securities hereunder shall be subject to
    the provisions of Section 2(b).
 
    (d)    Amendments and Waivers. The provisions of this Agreement,
    including the provisions of this sentence, may not be amended, modified
    or supplemented, and waivers or consents to departures from the
    provisions hereof may not be given, unless the same shall be in writing
    and signed by the Company and the Holders of at least 67% of the then
    outstanding Registrable Securities (including, for this purpose any
    Registrable Securities issuable upon exercise or conversion of any
    Security). If a Registration Statement does not register all of the
    Registrable Securities pursuant to a waiver or amendment done in
    compliance with the previous sentence, then the number of Registrable
    Securities to be registered for each Holder shall be reduced pro rata
    among all Holders and each Holder shall have the right to designate
    which of its Registrable Securities shall be omitted from such
    Registration Statement. Notwithstanding the
  
  	13 	 

 
  
    foregoing, a waiver or consent to depart from the provisions hereof
    with respect to a matter that relates exclusively to the rights of a
    Holder or some Holders and that does not directly or indirectly affect
    the rights of other Holders may be given by such Holder or Holders of
    all of the Registrable Securities to which such waiver or consent
    relates; provided, however, that the provisions of this sentence may
    not be amended, modified, or supplemented except in accordance with the
    provisions of the first sentence of this Section 6(d).
 
    (e)    Notices. Any and all notices or other communications or
    deliveries required or permitted to be provided hereunder shall be
    delivered as set forth in the Purchase Agreement.
 
    (f)    Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall inure to the
    benefit of and be binding upon the successors and permitted assigns of
    each of the parties and shall inure to the benefit of each Holder. The
    Company may not assign (except by merger) its rights or obligations
    hereunder without the prior written consent of all of the Holders of
    the then outstanding Registrable Securities. Each Holder may assign
    their respective rights hereunder in the manner and to the Persons as
    permitted under the Purchase Agreement.
 
    (g)    Execution and Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in
    two or more counterparts, all of which when taken together shall be
    considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when
    counterparts have been signed by each party and delivered to the other
    party, it being understood that both parties need not sign the same
    counterpart. In the event that any signature is delivered by facsimile
    transmission or by e-mail delivery of a “.pdf” format data file, such
    signature shall create a valid and binding obligation of the party
    executing (or on whose behalf such signature is executed) with the same
    force and effect as if such facsimile or “.pdf” signature page were an
    original thereof.
 
    (h)    Governing Law. All questions concerning the construction,
    validity, enforcement and interpretation of this Agreement shall be
    determined in accordance with the provisions of the Purchase Agreement.
 
    (i)    Cumulative Remedies. The remedies provided herein are cumulative
    and not exclusive of any other remedies provided by law.
 
    (j)    Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of
    this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
    invalid, illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms,
    provisions, covenants and restrictions set forth herein shall remain in
    full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
    invalidated, and the parties hereto shall use their commercially
    reasonable efforts to find and employ an alternative means to achieve
    the same or substantially the same result as that contemplated by such
    term, provision, covenant or restriction. It is hereby stipulated and
    declared to be the intention of the parties that they would have
    executed the remaining terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions
    without including any of such that may be hereafter declared invalid,
    illegal, void or unenforceable.
 
    (k)    Headings. The headings in this Agreement are for convenience
    only, do not constitute a part of the Agreement and shall not be deemed
    to limit or affect any of the provisions hereof.
  
  	14 	 

 
 
  
    (l)    Independent Nature of Holders’ Obligations and Rights. The
    obligations of each Holder hereunder are several and not joint with the
    obligations of any other Holder hereunder, and no Holder shall be
    responsible in any way for the performance of the obligations of any
    other Holder hereunder. Nothing contained herein or in any other
    agreement or document delivered at any closing, and no action taken by
    any Holder pursuant hereto or thereto, shall be deemed to constitute
    the Holders as a partnership, an association, a joint venture or any
    other kind of entity, or create a presumption that the Holders are in
    any way acting in concert with respect to such obligations or the
    transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each Holder shall be
    entitled to protect and enforce its rights, including without
    limitation the rights arising out of this Agreement, and it shall not
    be necessary for any other Holder to be joined as an additional party
    in any proceeding for such purpose.
 
********************
    IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Registration Rights
    Agreement as of the date first written above.
 
                   DRONE GUARDER, INC.
 
 
                    By:
                    Name: Adam Taylor
                    Title: CEO
 

                   EMA FINANCIAL, LLC
 
                    By:
                    Name: Adam Taylor
                    Title: Authorized Signatory
                     
  	15 	 

 
Annex A
 
                   Plan of Distribution
 
    Each Selling Stockholder (the “Selling Stockholders”) of the common
    stock and any of their pledgees, assignees and successors-in-interest
    may, from time to time, sell any or all of their shares of common stock
    on the Nasdaq Stock Market or any other stock exchange, market or
    trading facility on which the shares are traded or in private
    transactions. These sales may be at fixed or negotiated prices. A
    Selling Stockholder may use any one or more of the following methods
    when selling shares:
 
· 	ordinary brokerage transactions and transactions in which the 
broker-dealer solicits purchasers;
 
· 	block trades in which the broker-dealer will attempt to sell the shares 
as agent but may position and resell a portion of the block as principal to 
facilitate the transaction;
 
· 	purchases by a broker-dealer as principal and resale by the 
broker-dealer for its account;
 
· 	an exchange distribution in accordance with the rules of the applicable 
exchange;
· 	privately negotiated transactions;
· 	settlement of short sales entered into after the effective date of the 
registration statement of which this prospectus is a part;
 
· 	broker-dealers may agree with the Selling Stockholders to sell a 
specified number of such shares at a stipulated price per share;
 
· 	through the writing or settlement of options or other hedging 
transactions, whether through an options exchange or otherwise;
 
· 	a combination of any such methods of sale; or
· 	any other method permitted pursuant to applicable law.
     
    The Selling Stockholders may also sell shares under Rule 144 under the
    Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), if
    available, rather than under this prospectus.
 
    Broker-dealers engaged by the Selling Stockholders may arrange for
    other brokers-dealers to participate in sales. Broker-dealers may
    receive commissions or discounts from the Selling Stockholders (or, if
    any broker-dealer acts as agent for the purchaser of shares, from the
    purchaser) in amounts to be negotiated, but, except as set forth in a
    supplement to this Prospectus, in the case of an agency transaction not
    in excess of a customary brokerage commission in compliance with FINRA
    NASD Rule 2440; and in the case of a principal transaction a markup or
    markdown in compliance with NASD IM-2440.
  
  	16 	 

 
 
    In connection with the sale of the common stock or interests therein,
    the Selling Stockholders may enter into hedging transactions with
    broker-dealers or other financial institutions, which may in turn
    engage in short sales of the common stock in the course of hedging the
    positions they assume. The Selling Stockholders may also sell shares of
    the common stock short and deliver these securities to close out their
    short positions, or loan or pledge the common stock to broker-dealers
    that in turn may sell these securities. The Selling Stockholders may
    also enter into option or other transactions with broker-dealers or
    other financial institutions or the creation of one or more derivative
    securities which require the delivery to such broker-dealer or other
    financial institution of shares offered by this prospectus, which
    shares such broker-dealer or other financial institution may resell
    pursuant to this prospectus (as supplemented or amended to reflect such
    transaction).
 
    The Selling Stockholders and any broker-dealers or agents that are
    involved in selling the shares may be deemed to be “underwriters”
    within the meaning of the Securities Act in connection with such sales.
    In such event, any commissions received by such broker-dealers or
    agents and any profit on the resale of the shares purchased by them may
    be deemed to be underwriting commissions or discounts under the
    Securities Act. Each Selling Stockholder has informed the Company that
    it does not have any written or oral agreement or understanding,
    directly or indirectly, with any person to distribute the Common Stock.
    In no event shall any broker-dealer receive fees, commissions and
    markups which, in the aggregate, would exceed eight percent (8%).
 
    The Company is required to pay certain fees and expenses incurred by
    the Company incident to the registration of the shares. The Company has
    agreed to indemnify the Selling Stockholders against certain losses,
    claims, damages and liabilities, including liabilities under the
    Securities Act.
 
    Because Selling Stockholders may be deemed to be “underwriters” within
    the meaning of the Securities Act, they will be subject to the
    prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act including Rule
    172 thereunder. In addition, any securities covered by this prospectus
    which qualify for sale pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act
    may be sold under Rule 144 rather than under this prospectus. There is
    no underwriter or coordinating broker acting in connection with the
    proposed sale of the resale shares by the Selling Stockholders.
 
    We agreed to keep this prospectus effective until the earlier of (i)
    the date on which the shares may be resold by the Selling Stockholders
    without registration and without regard to any volume limitations by
    reason of Rule 144 under the Securities Act or any other rule of
    similar effect or (ii) all of the shares have been sold pursuant to
    this prospectus or Rule 144 under the Securities Act or any other rule
    of similar effect. The resale shares will be sold only through
    registered or licensed brokers or dealers if required under applicable
    state securities laws. In addition, in certain states, the resale
    shares may not be sold unless they have been registered or qualified
    for sale in the applicable state or an exemption from the registration
    or qualification requirement is available and is complied with.
  
    Under applicable rules and regulations under the Exchange Act, any
    person engaged in the distribution of the resale shares may not
