    Stock has been (or will be) taken prior to the Closing.  This
    Agreement,  when executed  and delivered by or on behalf of the

    the Company, legally enforceable against the Company  in  accordance 
    with  its  terms, except (a) as limited by applicable bankruptcy,
    insolvency, reorganization, moratorium , fraudulent conveyance or other
    laws of general application  relating  to  or  affecting  the

       as-converted basis, all outstanding options on an as-exercised basis
       and all other securities convertible into Common Stock;

       to a Dilutive Issuance, divided by$  ; and
 
2
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
       C = The number of new shares of Common Stock issued in a Dilutive
       Issuance.
 
      The Investors rights under this Section 4 shall terminate upon the
      consummation of an initial public offering of the Companys equity
      securities and the listing of the Companys equity securities on a
      national securities exchange.
 
  5.              Representations and Warranties of the Investors. Each
  Investor, severally and not jointly,  represents  and warrants,  as of
  the date hereof, that:
 
    5.1.         Authorization. The Investor has full power and authority
    to enter into this Agreement. This Agreement, when executed and 
    delivered  by  the  Investor,  will  constitute  a  valid and legally
    binding obligation of the  Investor,  enforceable  against  the 
    Investor  in accordance with its terms, except (a) as limited by
    applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or
    fraudulent conveyance and any other laws of general application
    relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally
    or (b) as limited by laws relating to the availability of specific
    performance, injunctive relief or other equitable remedies.
 
    5.2.         Purchase Entirely for Own Account. The Investor
    understands that the shares of Common Stock (the Shares) to be
    acquired by the Investor are restricted securities and have not been
    registered under the Securities Act or any applicable state securities
    law and is acquiring the Shares as principal for its own account and
    not with a view to or for distributing or reselling such Shares or any
    part thereof in violation of the Securities Act or any applicable state
    securities law, has no present intention of distributing any of such
    Shares in violation of the Securities Act or any applicable state
    securities law and has no direct or indirect arrangement or
    understandings with any other persons to distribute or regarding the
    distribution of such Shares in violation of the Securities Act or any
    applicable state securities law. The Investor is acquiring the Shares
    hereunder in the ordinary course of its business.
 
    5.3.         Disclosure of Information. The Investor has had an
    opportunity to discuss the Companys, business, management, financial
    affairs and the terms and conditions of the  offering of the Shares
    with the Companys management and has had an opportunity to review the
    Companys facilities, and the Investor has been furnished with copies
    of  documents  relating  thereto that the Investor has requested. The
    foregoing, however, does not limit or modify the representations and
    warranties of the Company in Section 2 of this Agreement or the right
    of the Investors to rely thereon.·
 
    5.4.         Lack of Liquidity. The Investor is presently able (a) to
    bear the economic risk of the Investors investment in the Shares, (b)
    to hold the Shares for an indefinite period of time and (c) to afford a
    complete loss of the Investors investment.  The Investor has
    sufficient liquid assets so that the illiquidity associated with the
    Investors investment in the Shares will not cause any financial
    difficulties for the Investor or affect the Investors ability to
    provide for the Investors current needs and possible financial
    contingencies. The Investor is able to bear the high degree of economic
    risk of this investment including, but not limited to, the possible
    complete loss of Investors entire investment and the limited
    transferability of the Shares, which may make liquidation of this
    investment impossible for the indefinite future. The Investors
    commitment to speculative investments (including the investment by the
    Investor in the Shares) is reasonable in relation to the Investors net
    worth or investment portfolio.
 
    5.5.         Knowledge and Experience. The Investor has such knowledge
    and experience in financial and business matters that the Investor is
    capable of evaluating the merits and risks of a speculative investment
    which involves a high degree of risk of loss of the entire investment,
 
3
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
       such as an investment in the Shares, and of making an informed
       investment decision with respect thereto.
 
    5.6.         Restricted Securities. The Investor understands that the
    Shares have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities
    Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), by reason of a specific
    exemption from the registration provisions of the Securities Act which
    depends upon, among other things, the bona fide nature of the
    investment intent and the accuracy of the Investors representations as
    expressed herein. The Investor understands that the Shares are
    restricted securities under applicable U.S. federal and state
    securities laws and that, pursuant to these laws, the Investor must
    hold the Shares indefinitely unless they are registered with the
    Securities and Exchange Commission and qualified by state authorities
    or an exemption from such registration and qualification requirements
    is available.  The Investor  acknowledges that  the  Company  has  no 
    obligation  to  register  or  qualify  the  Shares  for  resale. The
    Investor further acknowledges that if  an exemption  from registration 
    or qualification  is  available,  it may be conditioned on various
    requirements including, but  not  limited  to,  the  time  and  manner 
    of sale, the holding period for the Shares and on requirements relating
    to the Company which are outside of the Investors control, and which
    the Company is under no obligation and may not  be  able to satisfy.
 
    5.7.         No Public Market. The Investor understands that no public
    market now exists for the Shares and that the Company has made no
    assurances that a public market will ever exist for the Shares.
 
    5.8.         Legends. The Investor understands that the Shares and any
    securities issued in respect of or exchange for the Shares may bear, in
    addition to any legend required by the securities laws of any state to
    the extent such laws are applicable to the Shares represented by the
    certificate so legended, a legend similar to the following:
 
       5.8.1.    THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT
       BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 (THE SECURITIES
       ACT), AND HAVE BEEN ISSUED IN RELIANCE ON AN EXEMPTION FROM
       REGISTRATION PROVIDED FROM REGULATIONS UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT. 
       THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE MAY NOT BE OFFERED OR
       SOLD, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, EXCEPT (A) PURSUANT TO AND IN

       REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT AND (B) PURSUANT
       TO AND IN CONFORMITY WITH ANY APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES OR BLUE
       SKY LAWS. OTHER THAN PURSUANT TO AND IN CONFORMITY WITH AN EFFECTIVE
       REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT, NO SUCH OFFER OR
       SALE OF THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE MAY BE MADE
       UNLESS, IF REQUESTED BY IT, BIOXCEL THERAPEUTICS, INC. HAS RECEIVED
       A WRITTEN LEGAL OPINION OF COUNSEL (SUCH COUNSEL AND OPINION
       REASONABLY ACCEPTABLE TO IT) TO THE EFFECT THAT SUCH OFFER OR SALE
       DOES NOT VIOLATE THE SECURITIES ACT OR ANY APPLICABLE STATE
       SECURITIES OR BLUE SKY LAWS.
 
    5.9.         Accredited Investor. The Investor is an accredited
    investor as defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D promulgated under
    the Securities Act.
 
     5.10.           Foreign Investors.  If the  Investor  is not  a United
      States person  (as defined by Section 7701(a)(30)  of the Code), the
     Investor  hereby  represents  that  it has satisfied itself

    as  to the full observance of the laws of its jurisdiction  in

    jurisdiction for the purchase of the Shares,  (b) any  foreign 
    exchange  restrictions applicable  to such purchase,  (c) any
    governmental or other consents that may need to be obtained and (d) the

    the purchase, holding, redemption, sale or transfer of the Shares. The
    Investors subscription and payment for and continued beneficial
    ownership of the Shares will not violate any applicable securities or
    other laws of the Investors jurisdiction.
 
    5.11.           No General Solicitation. Neither the Investor, nor any
    of its officers, directors, managers, employees, agents, stockholders,
    members or partners has, either directly or indirectly, including

    (b) published any advertisement in connection with the offer and sale
    of the Shares.
 
    5.12.           Exculpation Among Investors. The Investor acknowledges
    that it is not relying upon any person, other than the Company and its
    officers and directors, in making its investment or decision to invest
    in the Company. The Investor agrees that neither any Investor nor the
    respective controlling persons, officers, directors, partners, agents
    or employees of any Investor shall be liable to any other Investor for
    any action heretofore taken or omitted to be taken by any of them in
    connection with the purchase of the Shares.
 
    5.13.           Residence.  If the Investor is an individual, then the
    Investor resides in the state, province or other jurisdiction
    identified in the address of the Investor set forth on Schedule 1; if
    the Investor is a partnership, corporation, limited liability company
    or other entity, then the office, or offices of the Investor in which

    or addresses of the Investor set forth on Schedule 1.  The Investor is
    a citizen of the United States of America or otherwise qualifies as a
    holder of stock of an S corporation under the Code.
 
  6.              [Registration Rights. If, at any time after the Closing,
  the Company shall propose to file with the Commission a registration

  with a sale of securities by any other stockholder) other than on Form
  S-1 in connection with the Companys IPO (as defined herein), Forms S-4
  or S-8 (or any successor to such forms), the Company shall give notice to

  Act without any requirement for the Company to maintain current public
  information and without any limitation on volume or manner of sale.]
 
  7.              [Reports Under Exchange Act. With a view to making
