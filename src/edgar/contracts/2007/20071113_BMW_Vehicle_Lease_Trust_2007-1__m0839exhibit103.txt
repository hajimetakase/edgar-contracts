TRANSFER OF 2007-1 SUBI CERTIFICATE


Section 2.01.
Transfer of 2007-1 SUBI Certificate.


      (a)
      In consideration of the Transferees delivery to, or upon the order
      of, the Transferor of cash in the amount of $1,248,391,261 (the
      Transfer Price), the Transferor does hereby absolutely sell,
      transfer, assign and otherwise convey to the Transferee, without
      recourse, and the Transferee does hereby purchase and acquire, as of
      the date set forth above, all of the following (collectively, the
      Assets):


            (i)
            all right, title and interest in and to the 2007-1 SUBI
            Certificate and the related interests in the 2007-1 SUBI
            represented thereby, including all monies due and paid thereon
            or in respect thereof;


            (ii)
            the beneficial rights evidenced thereby in any property that
            underlies or may be deemed to secure the respective interests
            in the 2007-1 SUBI represented by the 2007-1 SUBI Certificate;


            (iii)
            all of the Transferors rights and benefits, as Holder of the
            2007-1 SUBI Certificate under the Servicing Agreement and the
            SUBI Trust Agreement; and


            (iv)
            all proceeds of the foregoing.


      (b)
      The parties hereto intend that the sale, transfer and assignment of
      the Assets constitute a true sale and assignment of the Assets such
      that any interest in and title to the Assets would not be property of
      the Transferors estate in the event the Transferor becomes a debtor
      in a case under any bankruptcy law.  To the extent that the
      conveyance of the Assets hereunder is characterized by a court or
      similar governmental authority as a financing, it is intended by the
      Transferor and the Transferee that the interest conveyed constitute a
      first priority grant of a perfected security interest under the UCC
      as in effect in the State of New York by the Transferor to the
      Transferee to secure the Transfer Price to the Transferor.  The
      Transferor does hereby grant to the Transferee a security interest in
      all of its rights, title and privileges and interest in and to the
      Assets and the parties hereto agree that this Agreement constitutes a
      security agreement under all applicable law.

            business as a foreign limited partnership in good standing, and

            jurisdictions in which the ownership or lease of property or
            the conduct of its business shall require such qualifications,
            except where the failure to have any such license, approval or
            qualification would not have a material adverse effect on the
            condition, financial or otherwise, of the Transferor or would
            not have a material adverse effect on the ability of the
            Transferor to perform its obligations under this Agreement.

            and binding obligation of the Transferor, enforceable against
            it in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may
            be subject to or limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,

            affecting the enforcement of creditors rights in general and
            by general principles of equity, regardless of whether such
            enforceability shall be considered in a proceeding in equity or
            at law.


            (v)
            No Violation.  The execution, delivery and performance by the

            breach of any of the terms and provisions of, nor constitute

            instrument (other than this Agreement); nor violate any law or,
            to the knowledge of the Transferor, any order, rule or

            performance by the Transferor of its obligations under this
            Agreement.

            Agreement.


      (d)
      The representations and warranties set forth in this Section shall
      survive the sale of the Assets by the Transferor to the Transferee
      and the sale of the Assets by the Transferee to the Trust.  Upon
      discovery by the Transferor, the Transferee or the Vehicle Trustee of
      a breach of any of the foregoing representations and warranties, the
      party discovering such breach shall give prompt written notice to the
      others.


Section 2.03.
Financing Statement and Books and Records.


      (a)
      In connection with the conveyance of the Assets hereunder, the
      Transferor agrees that prior to the Closing Date, it will file, at
      its own expense, one or more financing statements with respect to the
      Assets meeting the requirements of applicable state law in such
      manner as necessary to perfect the sale of the Assets to the
      Transferor, and the proceeds thereof (and any continuation statements
      as are required by applicable state law), and to deliver a
      file-stamped copy of each such financing statement (or continuation
      statement) or other evidence of such filings (which may, for purposes
      of this Section, consist of telephone confirmation of such filings
      with the file stamped copy of each such filings to be provided to the
      Transferee in due course), as soon as is practicable after receipt by
      the Transferor thereof.


      (b)
      The Transferor further agrees that it will treat the transfer of the
      Assets as a sale for accounting purposes, take no actions
      inconsistent with the Transferees ownership of the Assets and on or
      prior to the Closing Date indicate on its books, records and
      statements that the Assets have been sold to the Transferee.


      (c)
      If the Transferor makes any change in its jurisdiction of
      organization (within the meaning of the applicable UCC), name or
      corporate structure that would make any financing statement or
      continuation statement filed in accordance with paragraph (a) above
      seriously misleading within the applicable provisions of the UCC or
      any title statute, the Transferor shall give the Transferee written
      notice thereof at least 30 days prior to such change and shall
      promptly file such financing statements or amendments as may be
      necessary to continue the perfection of the Transferors interest in
      the Assets.


Section 2.04.
Acceptance by the Transferee.  The Transferee agrees to comply with all 
covenants and restrictions applicable to a Holder of the 2007-1 SUBI 
Certificate and the interest in the 2007-1 SUBI represented thereby, 
whether set forth in the 2007-1 SUBI Certificate, in the SUBI Trust 
Agreement or otherwise, and assumes all obligations and liabilities, if 
any, associated therewith.

Schedule I
Perfection Representations, Warranties and Covenants


In addition to the representations, warranties and covenants contained in 
the SUBI Certificate Transfer Agreement, BMW Manufacturing, L.P., as 
transferor (the Transferor), hereby represents, warrants, and covenants 
to BMW Auto Leasing LLC, as transferee (the Transferee), as follows on 
the Closing Date:


      1.
      The SUBI Certificate Transfer Agreement creates a valid and
      continuing security interest (as defined in the applicable UCC) in
      the 2007-1 SUBI Certificate in favor of the Transferee, which
      security interest is prior to all other Liens and is enforceable as
      such as against creditors of and purchasers from the Transferor.


      2. The 2007-1 SUBI Certificate constitutes a general intangible,
      instrument, certificated security, or tangible chattel paper,
      within the meaning of the applicable UCC.


      3. The Transferor owns and has good and marketable title to the
      2007-1 SUBI Certificate free and clear of any Liens, claim or
      encumbrance of any Person, excepting only liens for taxes,
      assessments or similar governmental charges or levies incurred in the
      ordinary course of business that are not yet due and payable or as to
      which any applicable grace period shall not have expired, or that are
      being contested in good faith by proper proceedings and for which
      adequate reserves have been established, but only so long as
      foreclosure with respect to such a lien is not imminent and the use
      and value of the property to which the Lien attaches is not impaired
      during the pendency of such proceeding.


      4. The Transferor has received all consents and approvals to the sale
      of the 2007-1 SUBI Certificate under the SUBI Certificate Transfer
      Agreement to the Transferee required by the terms of the 2007-1 SUBI
      Certificate to the extent that it constitutes an instrument or a
      payment intangible.


      5. The Transferor has received all consents and approvals required by
      the terms of the 2007-1 SUBI Certificate, to the extent that it
      constitutes a securities entitlement, certificated security or
      uncertificated security, to the transfer to the Transferee of its
      interest and rights in the 2007-1 SUBI Certificate under the SUBI
      Certificate Transfer Agreement.


      6. The Transferor has caused or will have caused, within ten days
      after the effective date of the SUBI Certificate Transfer Agreement,
      the filing of all appropriate financing statements in the proper
      filing office in the appropriate jurisdictions under applicable law
      in order to perfect the sale of the 2007-1 SUBI Certificate from the
      Transferor to the Transferee and the security interest in the 2007-1
      SUBI Certificate granted under the SUBI Certificate Transfer
      Agreement.


      7. To the extent that the 2007-1 SUBI Certificate constitutes an
      instrument or tangible chattel paper, all original executed copies of
      each such instrument or tangible chattel paper have been delivered to
      the Transferee.


      8. Other than the transfer of the 2007-1 SUBI Certificate from the
      Transferor to the Transferee under the SUBI Certificate Transfer
      Agreement and from the Transferee to the Issuer under the Issuer SUBI
      Certificate Transfer Agreement and the security interest granted to
      the Indenture Trustee pursuant to the Indenture, the Transferor has
      not pledged, assigned, sold, granted a security interest in, or
      otherwise conveyed the 2007-1 SUBI Certificate. The Transferor has
      not authorized the filing of, nor is aware of, any financing
      statements against the Transferor that include a description of
      collateral covering the 2007-1 SUBI Certificate other than any
      financing statement relating to any security interest granted
      pursuant to the Basic Documents or that has been terminated.


      9. No instrument or tangible chattel paper that constitutes or
      evidences the 2007-1 SUBI Certificate has any marks or notations
      indicating that it has been pledged, assigned or otherwise conveyed
      to any Person other than the Indenture Trustee.
