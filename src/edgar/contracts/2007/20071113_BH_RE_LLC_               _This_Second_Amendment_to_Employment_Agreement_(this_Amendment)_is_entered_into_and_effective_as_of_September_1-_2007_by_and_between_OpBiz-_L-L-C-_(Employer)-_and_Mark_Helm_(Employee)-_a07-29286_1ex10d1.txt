Exhibit 10.1
AMENDMENT TO EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT
 
                This Second Amendment to Employment Agreement (this 
Amendment) is entered into and effective as of September 1, 2007 by and 
between OpBiz, L.L.C. (Employer), and Mark Helm (Employee).
 
                Whereas, the Employer and Employee are parties to an 
Employment Agreement dated November 2, 2004 (the Agreement);
 
                Whereas, Employer and Employee wish to make certain 
amendments to the Agreement as set forth below;
 
                Now, therefore, for good and valuable consideration, the 
Employer and Employee agree to amend the Agreement as follows:
 
The parties wish to amend Section 2 of the Agreement as follows:

    Effective Date; Specified Term.  Subject to earlier termination as
    provided in the Agreement, the term of the Employees employment
    hereunder shall be extended commencing on November 2, 2007 and
    terminating on the third anniversary thereof (the Specified Term). 
    If Employee remains employed by Employer following the Specified Term,
    any such employment shall be on an at-will basis, unless the parties
    agree in writing to extend the Specified Term.

This Amendment shall act to amend the terms as conditions set forth in the 
Agreement as set forth herein and all other terms and conditions of the 
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.  The Agreement, as so 
amended, shall supersede and replace any and all other prior discussions 
and negotiations as well as any and all agreements and arrangements that 
may have been entered into by and between Employee or any predecessor 
thereof, on the one hand, and Employee, on the other hand, prior to the 
date first written above relating to the subject matter hereof.  Employee 
acknowledges that all rights under such prior agreements and arrangements 
shall be extinguished.
