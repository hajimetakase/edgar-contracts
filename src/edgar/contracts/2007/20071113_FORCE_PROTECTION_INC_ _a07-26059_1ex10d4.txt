            suspensive condition, shall be the COMMENCEMENT DATE of this
            agreement.
             
            4.1.2                      The suspensive condition is
            established for the benefit of the LICENSOR, and no waiver of

5.                                       LICENCED RIGHTS
 
        5.1                               The LICENSOR hereby grants to the
        LICENSEE License 1 as provided for in clause 2.1.1.
         
        5.2                               The LICENSOR hereby grants to the
        LICENSEE, subject to PROOF OF CONCEPT, License 2 as set out in
        clause 2.1.2, being:
 
4
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
            5.2.1                        an exclusive licence to EXPLOIT
            the PATENT in the USA, Canada, the UK, France, Germany and
            Israel; and
             
            5.2.2                        a non-exclusive licence to EXPLOIT
            the PATENT in the RSA
             
        subject to the terms and conditions as set out in this agreement.
         
        5.3                               The license allows for the
        manufacturing and sale of PRODUCTS in any country forming part of
        the TERRITORY, save for the RSA where any PRODUCTS sold must also
        be at least manufactured in part, or assembled, in the RSA. Export
        by or for LICENSEE of PRODUCTS from a country in the TERRITORY to a
        country outside the TERRITORY shall be subject to the prior written
        approval of LICENSOR and such approval shall only be denied in the
        event that:
         
            5.3.1                      LICENSOR has granted exclusive
            rights in that country to a third party with respect to the
            PATENT or the TECHNOLOGY and such third partys rights may be
            infringed by LICENSEEs intended export to that country, or
             
            5.3.2                      Statutory or regulatory restriction
            on defence-related technology supply to the specific country
            outside the TERRITORY prevents such exports.
             
        5.4                               Should the LICENSEE fail to
        achieve a consistent level of sales as set out in the table below
        (the minimum royalty) through the application of the TECHNOLOGY
        and fail to pay over to the LICENSOR the balance between actual
        sales achieved and the specific minimum royalty fee, the LICENSOR
        shall have the right to, in its sole discretion, convert the
        exclusive nature of License 2 for a specific country in the
        TERRITORY as provided for in 5.2.1 to a non-exclusive license, or
        terminate the license.

            5.4.1                      For the first 3 (three) years after
            the COMMENCEMENT DATE, royalty payments from any one country in
            the TERRITORY in excess of that countrys minimum royalty
            payment, may be calculated towards the
 
5
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
            minimum royalty payment of any other country in the TERRITORY
            where the minimum royalty payment has not been attained in that
            ROYALTY YEAR. Thereafter, each countrys minimum royalty must
            be attained from sales in that country in order to maintain
            exclusivity of this licence.
             
        5.5                                 The LICENSOR is entitled to
        call from time to time for information on the endeavours being made
        by the LICENSEE and is entitled on reasonable notice and by
        appointment to enter the premises of the LICENSEE to inspect work
        being done and to receive information in reply to any relevant
        inquiry made by it.
         
        5.6                                 On the termination of this
        agreement:
         
            (i)                                   The LICENSEE must do all
            things reasonably required by the LICENSOR to protect its
            rights, titles and interests in the PATENT and other
            intellectual property owned by LICENSOR;
             
            (ii)                                All improvements made to
            the TECHNOLOGY by either PARTY and which form the subject of
            any claim in a patent or patent application anywhere in the
            world that is dependent on the PATENT, and/or any investments
            made by LICENSOR in the course thereof, will remain the
            property of the LICENSOR and the LICENSEE may make no claim in
            respect of them;
             
            (iii)                             or at any time before such
            termination at the request of the LICENSOR, the LICENSEE must
            promptly return to the LICENSOR:
             
                (a)                                  all specifications,
                samples, drawing, films, pamphlets, catalogues, advertising
                material and other materials, documents and papers of any
                nature sent to the LICENSEE by the LICENSOR relating to the
                TECHNOLOGY or the business of the LICENSOR (other than
                correspondence between the PARTIES) which the LICENSEE may
                have in its possession or under its control; and
                 
                (b)                                 a copy of separate

                in accordance with clause 11 suitable for the purpose of
                LICENSOR keeping record of the parties and countries whom
                PRODUCTS were sold to. For the avoidance of doubt it is
                specifically recorded that this provision 5.6 (iii) (b)
                does not include the original records and books of the
                LICENSEE but pertains to copies of records required to be
                kept for regulatory and statutory purposes.
                 
        5.7                               Within 30 days after the date on
        which termination of this agreement takes effect, the LICENSEE
        must, at its own cost, promptly return to the LICENSOR or otherwise
        dispose of as the LICENSOR instructs, those of the PRODUCTS and
        specifications and any parts which the LICENSEE may have in its
        possession or under its control and which are the property of the
        LICENSOR.

6.                                      TITLE TO THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
 
        6.1                               The LICENSEE acknowledges that
        all right, title and interest in and to the PATENT vests in the
        LICENSOR and that it has no claim of any nature in and to the
        PATENT or any other intellectual property owned by LICENSOR. The
        LICENSEE shall not at any time during or after termination or
        cancellation of this agreement dispute the validity or
        enforceability of such rights or of the PATENT, or cause to be done
        any act contesting or in any way impairing or tending to impair any
        part of that right, title and interest in the PATENT and shall not
        counsel or assist any other person to do so.
         
            6.1.1                      LICENSOR will have first right of
            refusal to patent an improvements made by LICENSEE to the
            TECHNOLOGY at its own cost, in those countries forming part of
            the TERRITORY where LICENSEE has EXPLOITATION rights. LICENSOR
            shall grant LICENSEE an exclusive royalty-free licence under
            such patents in all countries in the TERRITORY except RSA and a
            non-exclusive, royalty-free licence in RSA on condition that
            LICENSEE contributes 50% (fifty per cent) of the bona fide
            patenting expenses in each such country where a royalty-free
            licence is granted. In the event that LICENSOR elects not to
            apply for or to maintain patents in the TERRITORY on
            improvements made by LICENSEE, then LICENSEE may apply for, own
            and maintain such patents.
             
            6.1.2                      LICENSOR will own all improvements
            made by it. Such improvements made by LICENSOR and related
            patents will, subject to any statutory or regulatory approvals
            required be licensed to LICENSEE in the TERRITORY, subject to
            the terms of this agreement including the royalty provisions,
            provided the PARTIES are able to agree on the minimum royalty
            payable in respect of the licence to such improvements.
             
        6.2                                The LICENSOR does, however,
        grant the LICENSEE the right, where and when necessary, to modify
        the TECHNOLOGY for its specific needs and applications subject to
        the following conditions:
         
            6.2.1                      Such modifications of the TECHNOLOGY
            will not remove any obligations or benefits of the LICENSOR and
            LICENSEE in terms of this agreement.
             
            6.2.2                      The LICENSEE will provide the
            LICENSOR with copies or drawings of the final TECHNOLOGY for
            each case.

        14.1                         If during the currency in force of
        this agreement any infringement or illegal use of the TECHNOLOGY or

        attention of the LICENSEE, then and in such event the LICENSEE
        shall notify the LICENSOR of such infringement or illegal use.
         
        14.2                         It shall be within the discretion of
        the LICENSOR to determine what steps shall be taken against an
        infringer and the LICENSEE shall co-operate fully with the LICENSOR
        in whatever measures, including legal action, are taken to bring
        any infringement or illegal use to an end.

        license income derived from, such action as contemplated in 14.2
        above shall, after deduction of all legal costs incurred and which
        could be shown to the satisfaction of the LICENSOR as not having
        been recovered from the infringing party, be payable to the
        LICENSEE, which amount shall be reflected as income from SALES in
        the next ROYALTY YEAR statement as contemplated in Clause 9.6
        above, and royalty payable on this amount shall be calculated by
        using the average sales price of PRODUCTS in the ROYALTY YEAR to
        determine the equivalent number of PRODUCTS.
         
        14.4                         Should the LICENSOR refuse to
        institute action as contemplated in 14.2 above, the LICENSEE may

        proceedings of whatever nature arising out of the infringement or
        illegal use of the PATENT or the TECHNOLOGY with the prior written
        consent of the LICENSOR, which consent shall not be unreasonably
        withheld. LICENSOR will cooperate in any such action, including
        being named as a party if necessary to permit the action to
        proceed.

    The rights and obligations of the LICENSEE are personal and may not be

    subject to South African regulatory approval and approval by the

        TECHNOLOGY or the manufacture, sale or use of PRODUCTS.
         
        17.2                         Any claims for damages that may be
        instituted by LICENSEE against the LICENSOR in terms of this
        agreement, shall be limited to an amount equal to the actual amount
        of direct damages, or the aggregate amount of all payments made to
        the LICENSOR under the terms of this agreement, whichever is the
        least. This maximum liability shall be an aggregate liability for
        all claims howsoever arising, whether by contract, in delict or
        otherwise. Neither PARTY shall be liable to the other for any

        perform any of its obligations under this agreement insofar as it
        proves:
         
            18.1.1                that the failure was due to an impediment
            beyond its control;
             
            18.1.2                that it could not reasonably be expected
            to have taken the impediment and its effects upon the partys
            ability to perform into account at the time of the conclusion
            of the contract; and
 
12
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
            18.1.3                 that it could not reasonably have
            avoided or overcome the impediment or at least its effects.
             
        18.2                           An impediment in Clause 18.1 may
