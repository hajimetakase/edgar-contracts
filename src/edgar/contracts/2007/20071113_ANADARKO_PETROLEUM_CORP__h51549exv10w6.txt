Exhibit 10.6

PERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIAL


November 6, 2007

Dear                     :

The Compensation and Benefits Committee of the Anadarko Board of Directors 
has made an award of performance units (PUs) to you under the Companys 
1999 Stock Incentive Plan, as may be amended from time to time (the 
Plan). The PUs are subject to all terms and conditions of the Plan, the 
summary (prospectus) of the Plan and the provisions of this grant letter. 
The Plan summary is available via the Anadarko intranet at the following 
address: 
http://insider.anadarko.com/hr/stock_plan/1999_Restated_SIP_SPD_01-01-05.pdf.

You have been awarded {Target} PUs as your target. The vesting of these 
units is dependent upon the Companys relative Total Shareholder Return 
(TSR) over the specified Performance Periods. Fifty percent (50%) of the 
target PUs are subject to a two year Performance Period that begins 
1/1/2008 and ends 12/31/2009 (the 2009 Performance Period) and 50% of the 
target PUs are subject to a three year Performance Period that begins 
1/1/2008 and ends 12/31/2010 (the 2010 Performance Period). The 2009 and 
2010 Performance Period may each be individually referred to herein as a 
Performance Period. The maximum number of PUs that you can earn during 
each Performance Period will be calculated as follows {Target x 50% x 200%
}, with actual payout based on the Companys relative TSR ranking as 
described below.

Each PU represents the value of one share of the Companys common stock. 
The payout of PUs is contingent upon the Companys TSR ranking relative to 
a predetermined peer group during a Performance Period. The TSR measure 
provides an external comparison of the Companys performance against a peer 
group of companies and will be calculated as follows:


Average Closing Stock Price for the last 30 trading days of the Performance 
Period

Minus

Average Closing Stock Price for the 30 trading days preceding the beginning 
of the Performance
Period

Plus

Dividends paid per share over the Performance Period

Total Above Divided By

Average Closing Stock Price for the 30 trading days preceding the beginning 
of the Performance
Period

The actual number of PUs you will earn for each Performance Period is based 
upon the Companys relative TSR ranking as follows:

For example, if you were awarded 1,000 target PUs and the Companys 
relative ranking for the 2009 Performance Period is 3rd, you will receive 
820 PUs (1,000 x 50% x 164%) at the end of the 2009 Performance Period 
(subject to the other terms and conditions of this grant letter). If the 
Companys relative ranking for the 2010 Performance Period is 1st, you will 
receive 1,000 PUs (1000 x 50% x 200%) at the end of the 2010 Performance 
Period (subject to the other terms and conditions of this grant letter).

The peer group for the 2009 Performance Period and the 2010 Performance 
Period include Apache Corporation, ConocoPhillips, Devon Energy 
Corporation, EnCana Corporation, EOG Resources Inc., Hess Corporation, 
Marathon Oil Corporation, Noble Energy Inc., Occidental Petroleum 
Corporation, Pioneer Natural Resources Company and Talisman Energy Inc. If 
any peer companies cease to exist during either of the Performance Periods, 
the Compensation Committee has approved Chevron Corporation, Chesapeake 
Energy Corporation and XTO Energy, Inc. as replacement companies (in the 
order provided).

At the end of each Performance Period, the value attributed to the PUs that 
vest on such date shall be reduced by the applicable payroll taxes as a 
result of such vesting, and the resulting amount shall then be converted 
into shares of unrestricted Anadarko common stock using the closing price 
of the Companys common stock on the last day of the Performance Period. 
Your shares will be deposited in a direct registration account at Mellon.

Dividend Equivalents shall not be paid with respect to the PUs. The PUs do 
not have voting rights. PUs do, however, count toward your stock ownership 
requirements.

You will be allowed to make an election to defer your entire PU award. All 
deferral elections and distributions must be made in compliance with 409A 
regulations and made on a separate form provided by Anadarko to you.

If you voluntarily terminate your employment, or in the event you are 
terminated for cause, all unvested PUs will be immediately forfeited. Upon 
your death, disability (as defined in the Companys disability plan), 
involuntary termination without cause or a change in control event (as 
defined in the Plan) all your unvested PUs will be paid to you in 
accordance with your

Target. Upon your retirement (as defined by the applicable Company 
Retirement Plan) prior to the end of a Performance Period, you will receive 
a prorated payout, paid after the end of the Performance Period, based on 
actual performance and the number of months you worked. Your PUs are 
subject to several restrictions, including that such PUs may not be 
transferred, sold, assigned, pledged, exchanged, hypothecated or otherwise 
transferred, or disposed of to the extent then subject to restrictions.

Once PUs have vested and shares of Anadarko common stock have been 
delivered to you, you are free to sell, gift or otherwise dispose of such 
shares; provided that you comply with the applicable restrictions under the 
Companys Insider Trading Policy (including the receipt of pre-clearance) 
and the applicable stock ownership requirements.

If you have any questions on this grant, please call Preston Johnson at 
832-636-2705.


Sincerely,
