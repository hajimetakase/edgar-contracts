Borrower and Bank have agreed to modify the terms of the Note.
 
In consideration of Banks continued extension of credit and the agreements

AGREEMENT
 
ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF BALANCE. Borrower acknowledges that the most recent 
Commercial Loan Invoice sent to Borrower with respect to the Obligations 
under the Note is correct.
 
MODIFICATIONS.
 
The Note is hereby modified by deleting the provisions in the Note 
establishing the repayment terms and substituting the following in their 
place and stead:
 
REPAYMENT TERMS. The Note shall be due and payable in consecutive monthly 
payments of accrued interest only, commencing on September 30, 2007, and 
continuing on the same day of
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
each month thereafter until fully paid. In any event, all principal and 
accrued interest shall be due and payable on January 9, 2008.
 
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS AND REPRESENTATIONS. Borrower acknowledges and represents 
that the Note and other Loan Documents, as amended hereby, are in full 
force and effect without any defense, counterclaim, right or claim of 
set-off; that, after giving effect to this Agreement, no default or event 
that with the passage of time or giving of notice would constitute a 
default under the Loan Documents has occurred, all representations and 
warranties contained in the Loan Documents are true and correct as of this 
date, all necessary action to authorize the execution and delivery of this 
Agreement has been taken; and this Agreement is a modification of an 
existing obligation and is not a novation.
 
COLLATERAL. Borrower acknowledges and confirms that there have been no 
changes in the ownership of any collateral pledged to secure the 
Obligations (the Collateral) since the Collateral was originally pledged; 
Borrower acknowledges and confirms that the Bank has existing, valid first 
priority security interests and liens in the Collateral; and that such 
security interests and liens shall secure Borrowers Obligations, including 
any modification of the Note or Loan Agreement, if any, and all future 
modifications, extensions, renewals and/or replacements of the Loan 
Documents.
 
RENEWAL FEE. Borrower shall pay to Bank a renewal fee of $100,000 at the 
signing of this Agreement. Upon closing a syndicated credit facility with 
Wachovia Capital Markets as sole lead arranger and book runner, all of this 
fee will be credited toward any fees charged under such syndicated credit 
facility.
 
MISCELLANEOUS. This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and 
governed by the laws of the applicable state as originally provided in the 
Loan Documents, without reference to that states conflicts of law 
principles. This Agreement and the other Loan Documents constitute the sole 
agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter thereof and 
supersede all oral negotiations and prior writings with respect to the 
subject matter thereof. No amendment of this Agreement, and no waiver of 
any one or more of the provisions hereof shall be effective unless set 
forth in writing and signed by the parties hereto. The illegality, 
unenforceability or inconsistency of any provision of this Agreement shall

of the remaining provisions of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents.

However, in the event of any inconsistencies among this Agreement and any 
of the Loan Documents, the terms of this Agreement, and then the Note,

and by the different parties on separate counterparts. Each such 
counterpart shall be deemed an original, but all such counterparts shall 
together constitute one and the same agreement. Terms used in this 
Agreement which are capitalized and not otherwise defined herein shall have 
the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Note. LIMITATION ON LIABILITY;
