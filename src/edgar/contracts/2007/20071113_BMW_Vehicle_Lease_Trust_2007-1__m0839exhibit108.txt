                  and upon advice from such advisers as it has deemed
                  necessary.  It is not relying on any communication

                  communication (written or oral) received from the other
                  party shall be deemed to be an assurance or guarantee as
                  to the expected results of that Transaction.

                  Assessment and Understanding.  It is capable of assessing
                  the merits of and understanding (on its own behalf or
                  through independent professional advice), and understands
                  and accepts, the terms, conditions and risks of that
                  Transaction.  It is also capable of assuming, and
                  assumes, the risks of that Transaction.


                  (iii)
                  Status of Parties.  The other party is not acting as a
                  fiduciary for or an adviser to it in respect of that
                  Transaction.


            (b)
            The additional representation shall be given by Morgan only:


      (i)
      Pari Passu. Its obligations under this Agreement rank equal and
      ratably with all of its other unsecured, unsubordinated obligations
      except those obligations preferred by operation of law.


      (9)
      Amendment to Section 9(b) of the Agreement.  Section 9(b) of the
      Agreement is amended by adding the following sentence immediately
      following the end of the first sentence thereof:


            In addition, no amendment modification or waiver in respect of
            this Agreement will be effective unless the Rating Agency
            Condition is satisfied.


      (10)
      Set-off.  Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement or any
      other existing or future agreement, but subject to Section 2(c),
      Section 6 and Part 6(3)(viii) of this Schedule a, each party
      irrevocably waives any and all rights it may have to set off, net,
      recoup or otherwise withhold or suspend or condition payment or
      performance of any obligation between it and the other party
      hereunder against any obligation between it and the other party under
      any other agreements.  The provisions for Set-off set forth in
      Section 6(e) of the Agreement shall not apply to this Agreement.


      (11)
      Amendment to Section 6(e) of the Agreement.  Section 6(e) of the
      Agreement is amended by deleting the last sentence of the
      introductory paragraph thereof.


      (12)
      Modification to Definition of Indemnifiable Tax. Notwithstanding the
      definition of Indemnifiable Tax in Section 14, in relation to
      payments by Morgan, any Tax shall be an Indemnifiable Tax, and in
      relations to payments by the Counterparty, no Tax shall be an
      Indemnifiable Tax. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing sentence
      shall not by itself modify either party's right to terminate a
      Transaction based on the occurrence of a Tax Event or a Tax Event
      Upon Merger.


      (13)
      Waiver of Tax Confidentiality.  Notwithstanding anything herein to
      the contrary, any party subject to confidentiality obligations
      hereunder or under any other related document (and any employee,
      representative or other agent of such party) may disclose to any and
      all persons, without limitation of any kind, the U.S. federal income
      tax treatment and the U.S. federal income tax structure of the
      transactions contemplated hereby and all materials of any kind
      (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided to it
      relating to such tax treatment and tax structure.  However, no such
      party shall disclose any information relating to such tax treatment
      or tax structure to the extent nondisclosure is reasonably necessary
      in order to comply with applicable securities laws.


      (14)
      Rating Agency Notifications. Notwithstanding any other provision of
      this Agreement, this Agreement shall not be amended, no Early
      Termination Date shall be effectively designated by the Counterparty,
      and no transfer of any rights or obligations under this Agreement
      shall be made (other than a transfer of all of Morgans rights and
      obligations with respect to this Agreement in accordance with Part
      6(2)(A) below) unless Moodys and S&P have each been given prior
      written notice of such amendment, designation or transfer.

Following the occurrence of a Ratings Event I and/or a Ratings Event II, 
for as long as such Ratings Event I or Ratings Event II is continuing, the 
parties shall comply with the following provisions, as applicable.


            I.
            Ratings Event I:


            A.
            Actions upon Ratings Event 1:  Not later than:


                  (i)
                  30 calendar days in the case of a Ratings Event I with
                  respect to Moodys only; and


                  (ii)
                  ten Business Days in the case of a Ratings Event I with
                  respect to S&P:


      after a Ratings Event I has occurred and is continuing, Morgan shall,
      at its own expense deliver Eligible Collateral to Counterparty in
      accordance with the terms of the Approved Credit Support Document
      and, following such delivery, maintain Eligible Collateral as
      required under the Approved Credit Support Document;


      Morgans obligations under this Part 6(1)(I) shall cease, solely with
      respect to such occurrence, if (A) there is no Ratings Event I or (B)
      Morgan has, at its own expense, either provided an Eligible Guarantee
      in respect of all Morgans present and future obligations under this
      Agreement or transferred its rights and obligations pursuant to a
      Qualifying Novation in accordance with the terms of this Schedule.


            B.
            Eligible Guarantee or Eligible Replacement below Ratings Event
            I Levels


      If a Qualifying Novation is made to an Eligible Replacement or an
      Eligible Guarantee is provided and, immediately after the execution
      of such Qualifying Novation or Eligible Guarantee (as applicable),
      there is a Ratings Event I, then (so long as such Ratings Event I is
      continuing) Part 6(1)(I.A.) above shall apply without regard to the
      30 calendar day time (or 10 Business Day) period referred to therein.


            II.
            Ratings Event II


            A.
            Actions upon Ratings Event II


If a Ratings Event II has occurred and is continuing, the following shall 
occur.


      Morgan shall, at its own expense, use commercially reasonable efforts
      to, as soon as reasonably practicable (and, in the case of a Ratings
      Event II with respect to S&P only, within 60 calendar days):


            (A) provide, or cause to be provided, an Eligible Guarantee to
            Counterparty in respect of all Morgans present and future
            obligations under this Agreement;


            or


            (B) transfer Morgans rights and obligations under the
            Agreement and all Confirmations pursuant to a Qualifying
            Novation.


      If, immediately prior to such Ratings Event II, Morgan is required to
      deliver and maintain Eligible Collateral following a Ratings Event I,
      Morgan shall continue to maintain Eligible Collateral under the
      Approved Credit Support Document.


            If, immediately prior to such Ratings Event II, Morgan is not
            required to deliver and maintain Eligible Collateral following
            a Ratings Event I, then Morgan shall post Eligible Collateral,
            within ten Business Days following a Ratings Event II with
            respect to S&P, in accordance with the terms of the Approved
            Credit Support Document until Morgan has provided an Eligible
            Guarantee in respect of all Morgans present and future
            obligations under this Agreement or transferred its rights and
            obligations pursuant to a Qualifying Novation in accordance
            with terms of this Schedule. In addition, Morgan shall continue
            to use commercially reasonable efforts to either transfer its
            rights and obligations pursuant to a Qualifying Novation or to
            provide an Eligible Guarantee in accordance with terms of this
            Schedule.


      Morgans obligations under this Part 6(1)II shall cease, solely with
      respect to such occurrence, if (A) there is no Rating Events II or
      (B) Morgan has either provided an Eligible Guarantee in respect of
      all Morgans present and future obligations under this Agreement or
      transferred its rights and obligations pursuant to a Qualifying
      Novation, in either case in accordance with the terms of this
      Schedule.


            B.
            Ratings Event II Event of Default/Additional Termination Event


      Failure by Morgan to comply with the requirement of this Part 6(1)II
      to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain an Eligible
      Guarantee in respect of all Morgans present and future obligations
      under this Agreement or Qualifying Novation shall constitute an Event
      of Default with respect to Morgan.


      If Morgan has not, within 10 Business Days of the occurrence of a
      Ratings Event II (or 60 calendar days in the case of a Ratings Event
      II with respect to S&P only), obtained an Eligible Guarantee in
      respect of all Morgans present and future obligations under this
      Agreement or effected a Qualifying Novation, and such Ratings Event
      II is continuing, it shall constitute an Additional Termination Event
      in respect of which Morgan is the sole Affected Party and all
      Transactions are Affected Transactions; provided that where there is
      a Ratings Event II with respect to Moodys only, it will only
      constitute an Additional Termination Event if one or more Eligible
      Replacements has made a Firm Offer (in response to solicitation
      either by Morgan or the Counterparty) to be the transferee of a
      transfer pursuant to a Qualifying Novation and/or (b) at least one
      entity has made a Firm Offer to provide an Eligible Guarantee in
      respect of all Morgans present and future obligations under this
      Agreement.


      Failure by Morgan to post or maintain Eligible Collateral in
      accordance with the Approved Credit Support Document shall be an
      Event of Default under Section 5(a)(iii).

      B.
      Other Transfers

      Condition has been met.


      (3)
      Termination Amounts


      Notwithstanding Section 6 of this Agreement, so long as Morgan is (A)

      to (viii) below shall apply:


            (i)
            The Counterparty shall not designate as an Early Termination
            Date a date earlier than 10 Business Days after the notice
            designating such Early Termination Date becomes effective.


            (ii)
            The definition of Market Quotation shall be deleted in its

            Terminated Transactions, a Firm Offer (which may be solicited
            by either the Counterparty or Morgan) which is (1) made by a
            Reference Market-maker that is an Eligible Replacement, (2) for
            an amount that would be paid to the Counterparty (expressed as
            a negative number) or by the Counterparty (expressed as a
            positive number) in consideration of an agreement between
            Counterparty and such Reference Market-maker to enter into a
            transaction (the Replacement Transaction) that would have the
            effect of preserving for such party the economic equivalent of
            any payment or delivery (whether the underlying obligation was
            absolute or contingent and assuming the satisfaction of each
            applicable condition precedent) by the parties under Section
            2(a)(i) in respect of such Terminated Transactions that would,
            but for the occurrence of the relevant Early Termination Date,
            have been required after that date, (3) made on the basis that
            Unpaid Amounts in respect of the Terminated Transactions are to
            be excluded but, without limitation, any payment or delivery
            that would, but for the relevant Early Termination Date, have
            been required (assuming satisfaction of each applicable
            condition precedent) after that Early Termination Date is to be
            included and (4) made in respect of a Replacement Transaction
            with terms substantially the same as those of this Agreement
            (save for the exclusion of provisions relating to Transactions
            that are not Terminated Transactions).


            (iii)
            The definition of Settlement Amount shall be deleted in its
            entirety and replaced with the following:


            Settlement Amount means, with respect to any Early
            Termination Date, an amount (as determined by the Counterparty)
            equal to the Termination Currency Equivalent of the amount
            (whether positive or negative) of any Market Quotation for the
            relevant Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated
            Transactions that is accepted by the Counterparty so as to
            become legally binding, provided that:


                  (a)
                  If, on or before the day falling ten Local Business Days
                  after the day on which the Early Termination Date is
                  designated or such later day as Counterparty may specify
                  in writing to Morgan, (but in either case no later than
                  the Early Termination Date) (such day, the Latest

                  Equivalent of the amount (whether positive or negative)

            commercial terms substantially the same as those of this
            Agreement which shall be deemed upon receipt of evidence that
            the Rating Agency Condition has been met (save for the
            exclusion of provisions relating to Transactions that are not

            (v)
            At any time on or before the Latest Settlement Amount
            Determination Day at which two or more Market Quotations remain
            capable of becoming legally binding upon acceptance, the
            Counterparty shall be entitled to accept only the lowest of
            such Market Quotations.


            (vi)
            If the Counterparty requests Morgan in writing to obtain Market
            Quotations, Morgan shall use its reasonable efforts to do so on
            or before the Latest Settlement Amount Determination Day.


            (vii)
            Morgan may also elect to obtain Market Quotations without a
            request from the Counterparty.


            (viii)
            If the Settlement Amount is a negative number, Section
            6(e)(i)(3) of this Agreement shall be deleted in its entirety
            and replaced with the following:

            Market Quotation apply, (1) the Counterparty shall pay to
            Morgan an amount equal to the absolute value of the Settlement
            Amount in respect of the Terminated Transactions, (2) the
            Counterparty shall pay to Morgan the Termination Currency
            Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to Morgan and (3) Morgan
            shall pay to the Counterparty the Termination Currency
            Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to the Counterparty,
            provided that, (i) the amounts payable under (2) and (3) shall
            be subject to netting in accordance with Section 2(c) of this
            Agreement and (ii) notwithstanding any other provision of this

                  Rate applicable to each item of Eligible Collateral that
                  is to be Transferred.
