Reserve Definitions

The proved reserves included herein conform to the definitions as set forth 
in the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation S-X Part 210.4-10 
(A) as clarified by various Commission Staff Accounting Bulletins and to 
the definitions endorsed by the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE), the 
Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers (SPEE) and the World Petroleum 
Congresses (WPC). Definitions of these reserves are included immediately 
following this letter.

Estimate of Reserves

Estimates of reserves were prepared by the use of geological and 
engineering methods generally accepted by the petroleum industry. The 
method or combination of methods utilized in the analysis of each reservoir 
was tempered by experience in the area, stage of development, quality and 
completeness of basic data, and production history.

Where applicable, the volumetric method was employed for determining the 
original quantities of hydrocarbons in place. Structural and isopachous 
maps were furnished by New Century Energy Corp. and, after evaluation by 
us, were accepted as correct. These data were used in determining reservoir 
volumes. In some cases drainage areas were assigned based on analogy. 
Electrical logs, core analysis, and other available data were used to 
determine representative values for porosity and interstitial water 
saturation. Reserves based upon volumetric calculations or other methods 
such as analogy with offset wells are usually subject to greater revision 
than those based upon production and/or pressure performance data. 
Therefore, it may be necessary to revise these estimates up or down in the 
future as more reliable engineering data becomes available.

Reserves of depletion-type reservoirs or those whose performance disclosed 
reliable decline in production-rate trends or other diagnostic 
characteristics were estimated by the application of appropriate decline 
curves or other performance relationships. In the analysis of production 
decline curves, reserves were established only to a calculated economic 
limit.

Estimate of Future Producing Rates

Initial production rates were based on the current rates for those 
reservoirs now on production. If no production decline was established, a 
decline profile analogous to similar wells was used. If a decline trend was 
established, this trend was used as the basis for estimating future rates.

Product Prices

At the request of Aquatic Cellulose International Corp. This report was 
prepared using gas prices in effect on December 31, 2006 and provided by 
New Century Energy Corp.

Gas Prices

For the current report, New Century Energy Corp. Provided gas prices for 
each lease. The individual prices were held constant over the life of the 
reserves with no future price escalation due to inflation. The resulting 
overall average price for the gas reserves is $ 6.17 Per MCF and accounts 
for 100.0 Percent of the future gross income from all proved reserves.

Income Data

The future gross revenue is determined before deduction of production and 
ad valorem taxes. Future net income is determined after deduction of the 
normal costs of operating the wells, development costs, production taxes 
and ad valorem taxes. The operating costs, and development costs were held 
constant with no future price escalation due to inflation. The future net 
income is before deduction of state and federal income taxes and has not 
been adjusted for outstanding loans, which may exist. It does not include 
any adjustment for cash on hand or undistributed income.

Neither the salvage value of lease equipment nor the cost to abandon the 
properties has been considered in this study.

Table a presents a summary of the 8/8ths reserves, interests and prices for 
the subject properties by well. Table B presents a summary of net reserves 
and income data for the subject properties by well and Table C presents a 
summary of proved net reserves and income data ranked by 10% discounted 
future net income. Tables 1 through 4 are the Grand Summaries and Tables 5 
through 22 are individual well cashflows alphabetically by well. Adjacent 
to each table, which represents our estimated projections for a particular 
property, is a production decline curve, which graphically illustrates past 
hydrocarbon production history and our estimated projection of future 
production.

General

The reserves included in this report are estimates only and should not be 
construed as being exact quantities. They may or may not be actually 
recovered and, if recovered, the revenues there from and the actual costs 
related thereto could be more or less than the estimated amounts. Because 
of governmental policies and uncertainties of supply and demand, the actual 
sales volumes and the prices received from the reserves, along with the 
costs incurred in recovering such reserves, may vary from those assumptions 
included in this report. Also, estimates of reserves may increase or 
decrease as a result of future operations.

We are qualified to perform engineering evaluations and do not claim 
expertise in accounting or legal matters. As in all aspects of oil and gas 
evaluation, there are uncertainties inherent in the interpretation of 
engineering data and, therefore, our conclusions necessarily represent only 
our best-informed professional judgments.

The titles to the properties have not been examined by R. A. Lenser and 
Associates, Inc. Nor has the actual degree or type of interest owned been 
independently confirmed. The data used in our estimates were obtained from 
new century energy corp. And were accepted as accurate. For the purposes of 
this report, a field inspection of the properties was not performed nor was 
the mechanical operation or condition of the wells and their related 
facilities examined. We have not investigated possible environmental 
liability related to the properties and, therefore, our estimates do not 
include any potential liability to restore and clean up any damages caused 
by past operations.

We are independent petroleum engineers and geologists; we do not own an 
interest in these properties and are not employed on a contingent basis. 
Basic geologic and field performance data together with our engineering

PETROLEUM RESERVES DEFINITIONS

SOCIETY OF PETROLEUM ENGINEERS (SPE)
AND
WORLD PETROLEUM CONGRESSES (WPC)

Reserves

Reserves are those quantities of petroleum* which are anticipated to be 
commercially recovered from known accumulations from a given date forward. 
All reserve estimates involve some degree of uncertainty. The uncertainty 
depends chiefly on the amount of reliable geologic and engineering data 
available at the time of the estimate and the interpretation of these data. 
The relative degree of uncertainty may be conveyed by placing reserves into 
one of two principal classifications, either proved or unproved. Unproved 
reserves are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves and may be 
further sub-classified as probable and possible reserves to denote 
progressively increasing uncertainty in their recoverability.

The intent of the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE) and the World 
Petroleum Congresses (WPC) in approving additional classifications beyond 
proved reserves is to facilitate consistency among professionals using such 
terms. In presenting these definitions, neither organization is 
recommending public disclosure of reserves classified as unproved. Public 
disclosure of the quantities classified as unproved reserves is left to the 
discretion of the countries or companies involved.

Estimation of reserves is done under conditions of uncertainty. The method 
of estimation is called deterministic if a single best estimate of reserves 
is made based on known geological, engineering, and economic data. The 
method of estimation is called probabilistic when the known geological, 
engineering, and economic data are used to generate a range of estimates 
and their associated probabilities. Identifying reserves as proved, 
probable, and possible has been the most frequent classification method and 
gives an indication of the probability of recovery. Because of potential 
differences in uncertainty, caution should be exercised when aggregating 
reserves of different classifications.

Reserves estimates will generally be revised as additional geologic or 
engineering data becomes available or as economic conditions change. 
Reserves do not include quantities of petroleum being held in inventory, 
and may be reduced for usage or processing losses if required for financial 
reporting.

Reserves may be attributed to either natural energy or improved recovery 
methods. Improved recovery methods include all methods for supplementing 
natural energy or altering natural forces in the reservoir to increase 
ultimate recovery. Examples of such methods are pressure maintenance, 
cycling, waterflooding, thermal methods, chemical flooding, and the use of 
miscible and immiscible displacement fluids. Other improved recovery 
methods may be developed in the future as petroleum technology continues to 
evolve.

*Petroleum: for the purpose of these definitions, the term petroleum refers 
to naturally occurring liquids and gases which are predominately comprised 
of hydrocarbon compounds. Petroleum may also contain non-hydrocarbon 
compounds in which sulfur, oxygen, and/or nitrogen atoms are combined with 
carbon and hydrogen. Common examples of non-hydrocarbons found in petroleum 
are nitrogen,
carbon dioxide, and hydrogen sulfide.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 
Proved Reserves

           Proved reserves are those quantities of petroleum which, by 
analysis of geological and engineering data, can be estimated with 
reasonable certainty to be commercially recoverable, from a given date 
forward, from known reservoirs and under current economic conditions, 
operating methods, and government regulations. Proved reserves can be 
categorized as developed or undeveloped.

If deterministic methods are used, the term reasonable certainty is 
intended to express a high degree of confidence that the quantities will be 
recovered. If probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 
90% probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed 
the estimate.

Establishment of current economic conditions should include relevant 
historical petroleum prices and associated costs and may involve an 
averaging period that is consistent with the purpose of the reserve 
estimate, appropriate contract obligations, corporate procedures, and 
government regulations involved in reporting these reserves.

In general, reserves are considered proved if the commercial producibility 
of the reservoir is supported by actual production or formation tests. In 
this context, the term proved refers to the actual quantities of petroleum 
reserves and not just the productivity of the well or reservoir. In certain 
cases, proved reserves may be assigned on the basis of well logs and/or 
core analysis that indicate the subject reservoir is hydrocarbon bearing 
and is analogous to reservoirs in the same area that are producing or have 
demonstrated the ability to produce on formation tests.

The area of the reservoir considered as proved includes (1) the area 
delineated by drilling and defined by fluid contacts, if any, and (2) the 
undrilled portions of the reservoir that can reasonably be judged as 
commercially productive on the basis of available geological and 
engineering data. In the absence of data on fluid contacts, the lowest 
known occurrence of hydrocarbons controls the proved limit unless otherwise 
indicated by definitive geological, engineering or performance data.

Reserves may be classified as proved if facilities to process and transport 
those reserves to market are operational at the time of the estimate or 
there is a reasonable expectation that such facilities will be installed. 
Reserves in undeveloped locations may be classified as proved undeveloped 
provided (1) the locations are direct offsets to wells that have indicated 
commercial production in the objective formation, (2) it is reasonably 
certain such locations are within the known proved productive limits of the 
objective formation, (3) the locations conform to existing well spacing 
regulations where applicable, and (4) it is reasonably certain the 
locations will be developed. Reserves from other locations are categorized 
as proved undeveloped only where interpretations of geological and 
engineering data from wells indicate with reasonable certainty that the 
objective formation is laterally continuous and contains commercially 
recoverable petroleum at locations beyond direct offsets.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 
Proved Reserves (Continued)

Reserves which are to be produced through the application of established 
improved recovery methods are included in the proved classification when 
(1) successful testing by a pilot project or favorable response of an 
installed program in the same or an analogous reservoir with similar rock 
and fluid properties provides support for the analysis on which the project 
was based, and, (2) it is reasonably certain that the project will proceed. 
Reserves to be recovered by improved recovery methods that have yet to be 
established through commercially successful applications are included in 
the proved classification only (1) after a favorable production response 
from the subject reservoir from either (a) a representative pilot or (b) an 
installed program where the response provides support for the analysis on 
which the project is based and (2) it is reasonable certain the project 
will proceed.

Unproved Reserves

Unproved reserves are based on geologic andior engineering data similar to 
that used in estimates of proved reserves; but technical, contractual, 
economic, or regulatory uncertainties preclude such reserves being 
classified as proved. Unproved reserves may be further classified as 
probable reserves and possible reserves.

Unproved reserves may be estimated assuming future economic conditions 
different from those prevailing at the time of the estimate. The effect of 
possible future improvements in economic conditions and technological 
developments can be expressed by allocating appropriate quantities of 
reserves to the probable and possible classifications.

Probable Reserves

Probable reserves are those unproved reserves which analysis of geological 
and engineering data suggests are more likely than not to be recoverable. 
In this context, when probabilistic methods are used, there should be at 
least a 50% probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal 
or exceed the sum of estimated proved plus probable reserves.

In general, probable reserves may include (1) reserves anticipated to be 
proved by normal stepout drilling where sub-surface control is inadequate 
to classify these reserves as proved, (2) reserves in formations that 
appear to be productive based on well log characteristics but lack core 
data or definitive tests and which are not analogous to producing or proved 
reservoirs in the area, (3) incremental reserves attributable to infill 
drilling that could have been classified as proved if closer statutory 
spacing had been approved at the timeof the estimate, (4) reserves 
attributable to improved recovery methods that have been established by 
repeated commercially successful applications when (a)a project or pilot is 
planned but not in operation and

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 
 (b) rock, fluid, and reservoir characteristics appear favorable for 
commercial application, (5) reserves in an area of the formation that 
appears to be separated from the proved area by faulting and the geologic 
interpretation indicates the subject area is structurally higher than the 
proved area, (6) reserves attributable to a future workover, treatment, 
re-treatment, change of equipment, or other mechanical procedures, where 
such procedure has not been proved successful in wells which exhibit 
similar behavior in analogous reservoirs, and (7) incremental reserves in 
proved reservoirs where an alternative interpretation of performance or 
volumetric data indicates more reserves than can be classified as proved.

RESERVE STATUS CATEGORIES

Reserve status categories define the development and producing status of 
wells and reservoirs.

Developed: developed reserves are expected to be recovered from existing 
wells including reserves behind pipe. Improved recovery reserves are 
considered developed only after the necessary equipment has been installed, 
or when the costs to do so are relatively minor. Developed reserves may be 
subcategorized as producing or non- producing.

  Producing: reserves subcategorized as producing are expected to be
  recovered from completion intervals which are open and producing at the
  time of the estimate. Improved recovery reserves are considered producing
  only after the improved recovery project is in operation.

  Non-producing: reserves subcategorized as non-producing include shut-in
  and behind-pipe reserves.0
 
     Shut-in reserves are expected to be recovered from (1)  completion
     intervals which are open at the time of the estimate but  which have
     not started producing, (2) wells which were shut-in for  market
     conditions or pipeline connections, or (3) wells not capable of 
     production for mechanical reasons.

    Behind pipe reserves are expected to be recovered from zones in
    existing wells, which will require additional completion work or future
    recompletion prior to the start of production.

Undeveloped reserves: undeveloped reserves are expected to be recovered: 
(1) from new wells on undrilled acreage, (2) from deepening existing wells 
to a different reservoir, or (3) where a relatively large expenditure is 
required to (a) recomplete an existing well or (b) install production or 
transportation facilities for primary or improved recovery projects.
