ARTICLE 1 GENERAL PROVISIONS
 
§ 1.1 BASIC DEFINITIONS
 
§ 1.1.1 THE CONTRACT DOCUMENTS
 
The Contract Documents consist of the Agreement between Owner and 
Contractor (hereinafter the Agreement), Conditions of the Contract 
(General, Supplementary and other Conditions), Drawings, Specifications, 
Addenda issued prior to execution of the Contract, other documents listed 
in the Agreement and Modifications issued after execution of the Contract. 
A Modification is (1) a written amendment to the Contract signed by both 
parties, (2) a Change Order, (3) a Construction Change Directive or (4) a 
written order for a minor change in the Work issued by the Architect. 
Unless specifically enumerated in the Agreement, the Contract Documents do 
not include other documents such as bidding requirements (advertisement or 
invitation to bid, Instructions to Bidders, sample forms, the Contractors 
bid or portions of Addenda relating to bidding requirements).
 
§ 1.1.2 THE CONTRACT
 
The Contract Documents form the Contract for Construction. The Contract 
represents the entire and integrated agreement between the parties hereto 
and supersedes prior negotiations, representations or agreements, either 
written or oral. The Contract may be amended or modified only by a 
Modification. The Contract Documents shall not be construed to create a 
contractual relationship of any kind (1) between the Architect and 
Contractor, (2) between the Owner and a Subcontractor or Sub-subcontractor, 
(3) between the Owner and Architect or (4) between any persons or entities 
other than the Owner and Contractor. The Architect shall, however, be 
entitled to performance and enforcement of obligations under the Contract 
intended to facilitate performance of the Architects duties.
 
§ 1.1.3 THE WORK
 
The term Work means the construction and services required by the 
Contract Documents, whether completed or partially completed, and includes 
all other labor, materials, equipment and services provided or to be 
provided by the Contractor to fulfill the Contractors obligations. The 
Work may constitute the whole or a part of the Project.
 
§ 1.1.4 THE PROJECT
 
The Project is the total construction of which the Work performed under the 
Contract Documents may be the whole or a part and which may include 
construction by the Owner or by separate contractors.
 
§ 1.1.5 THE DRAWINGS
 
The Drawings are the graphic and pictorial portions of the Contract 
Documents showing the design, location and dimensions of the Work, 
generally including plans, elevations, sections, details, schedules and 
diagrams.
 
§ 1.1.6 THE SPECIFICATIONS
 
The Specifications are that portion of the Contract Documents consisting of 
the written requirements for materials, equipment, systems, standards and 
workmanship for the Work, and performance of related services.
 
§ 1.1.7 THE PROJECT MANUAL
 
The Project Manual is a volume assembled for the Work which may include the 
bidding requirements, sample forms, Conditions of the Contract and 
Specifications.
 
§ 1.2 CORRELATION AND INTENT OF THE CONTRACT DOCUMENTS
 
§ 1.2.1 The intent of the Contract Documents is to include all items 
necessary for the proper execution and completion of the Work by the 
Contractor. The Contract Documents are complementary, and what is required 
by one shall be as binding as if required by all; performance by the 
Contractor shall be required only to the extent consistent with the 
Contract Documents and reasonably inferable from them as being necessary to 
produce the indicated results.
 
§ 1.2.2 Organization of the Specifications into divisions, sections and 
articles, and arrangement of Drawings shall not control the Contractor in 
dividing the Work among Subcontractors or in establishing the extent of 
Work to be performed by any trade.
 
§ 1.2.3 Unless otherwise stated in the Contract Documents, words which have 
well-known technical or construction industry meanings are used in the 
Contract Documents in accordance with such recognized meanings.

§ 1.3 CAPITALIZATION
 
§ 1.3.1 Terms capitalized in these General Conditions include those which 
are (1) specifically defined, (2) the titles of numbered articles or (3) 
the titles of other documents published by the American Institute of 
Architects.
 
§ 1.4 INTERPRETATION
 
§ 1.4.1 In the interest of brevity the Contract Documents frequently omit 
modifying words such as all and any and articles such as the and 
an, but the fact that a modifier or an article is absent from one 
statement and appears in another is not intended to affect the 
interpretation of either statement.
 
§ 1.5 EXECUTION OF CONTRACT DOCUMENTS
 
§ 1.5.1 The Contract Documents shall be signed by the Owner and Contractor. 
If either the Owner or Contractor or both do not sign all the Contract 
Documents, the Architect shall identify such unsigned Documents upon 
request.
 
§ 1.5.2 Execution of the Contract by the Contractor is a representation 
that the Contractor has visited the site, become generally familiar with 
local conditions under which the Work is to be performed and correlated 
personal observations with requirements of the Contract Documents.
 
§ 1.6 OWNERSHIP AND USE OF DRAWINGS, SPECIFICATIONS AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS 
OF SERVICE
 
§ 1.6.1 The Drawings, Specifications and other documents, including those 
in electronic form, prepared by the Architect and the Architects 
consultants are Instruments of Service through which the Work to be 
executed by the Contractor is described. The Contractor may retain one 
record set. Neither the Contractor nor any Subcontractor, Sub-subcontractor 
or material or equipment supplier shall own or claim a copyright in the 
Drawings, Specifications and other documents prepared by the Architect or 
the Architects consultants, and unless otherwise indicated the Architect 
and the Architects consultants shall be deemed the authors of them and 
will retain all common law, statutory and other reserved rights, in 
addition to the copyrights. All copies of Instruments of Service, except 
the Contractors record set, shall be returned or suitably accounted for to 
the Architect, on request, upon completion of the Work. The Drawings, 
Specifications and other documents prepared by the Architect and the 
Architects consultants, and copies thereof furnished to the Contractor, 
are for use solely with respect to this Project. They are not to be used by 
the Contractor or any Subcontractor, Sub-subcontractor or material or 
equipment supplier on other projects or for additions to this Project 
outside the scope of the Work without the specific written consent of the 
Owner, Architect and the Architects consultants. The Contractor, 
Subcontractors, Sub-subcontractors and material or equipment suppliers are 
authorized to use and reproduce applicable portions of the Drawings, 
Specifications and other documents prepared by the Architect and the 
Architects consultants appropriate to and for use in the execution of 
their Work under the Contract Documents. All copies made under this 
authorization shall bear the statutory copyright notice, if any, shown on 
the Drawings, Specifications and other documents prepared by the Architect 
and the Architects consultants. Submittal or distribution to meet official 
regulatory requirements or for other purposes in connection with this 
Project is not to be construed as publication in derogation of the 
Architects or Architects consultants copyrights or other reserved 
rights.
 
ARTICLE 2 OWNER
 
§ 2.1 GENERAL
 
§ 2.1.1 The Owner is the person or entity identified as such in the 
Agreement and is referred to throughout the Contract Documents as if 
singular in number. The Owner shall designate in writing a representative 
who shall have express authority to bind the Owner with respect to all 
matters requiring the Owners approval or authorization. Except as 
otherwise provided in Section 4.2.1, the Architect does not have such 
authority. The term Owner means the Owner or the Owners authorized 
representative.
 
§ 2.1.2 The Owner shall furnish to the Contractor within fifteen days after 
receipt of a written request, information necessary and relevant for the 
Contractor to evaluate, give notice of or enforce mechanics lien rights. 
Such information shall include a correct statement of the record legal 
title to the property on which the Project is located, usually referred to 
as the site, and the Owners interest therein.
 
§ 2.2 INFORMATION AND SERVICES REQUIRED OF THE OWNER
 
§ 2.2.1 The Owner shall, at the written request of the Contractor, prior to 
commencement of the Work and thereafter, furnish to the Contractor 
reasonable evidence that financial arrangements have been made to fulfill 
the Owners obligations under the Contract. Furnishing of such evidence 
shall be a condition precedent to commencement or

continuation of the Work. After such evidence has been furnished, the Owner 
shall not materially vary such financial arrangements without prior notice 
to the Contractor.
 
§ 2.2.2 Except for permits and fees, including those required under Section 
3.7.1, which are the responsibility of the Contractor under the Contract 
Documents, the Owner shall secure and pay for necessary approvals, 
easements, assessments and charges required for construction, use or 
occupancy of permanent structures or for permanent changes in existing 
facilities.
 
§ 2.2.3 The Owner shall furnish surveys describing physical 
characteristics, legal limitations and utility locations for the site of 
the Project, and a legal description of the site. The Contractor shall be 
entitled to rely on the accuracy of information furnished by the Owner but 
shall exercise proper precautions relating to the safe performance of the 
Work.
 
§ 2.2.4 Information or services required of the Owner by the Contract 
Documents shall be furnished by the Owner with reasonable promptness. Any 
other information or services relevant to the Contractors performance of 
the Work under the Owners control shall be furnished by the Owner after 
receipt from the Contractor of a written request for such information or 
services.
 
§ 2.2.5 Unless otherwise provided in the Contract Documents, the Contractor 
will be furnished, free of charge, such copies of Drawings and Project 
Manuals as are reasonably necessary for execution of the Work.
 
§ 2.3 OWNERS RIGHT TO STOP THE WORK
 
§ 2.3.1 If the Contractor fails to correct Work which is not in accordance 
with the requirements of the Contract Documents as required by Section 12.2 
or persistently fails to carry out Work in accordance with the Contract 
Documents, the Owner may issue a written order to the Contractor to stop 
the Work, or any portion thereof, until the cause for such order has been 
eliminated; however, the right of the Owner to stop the Work shall not give 
rise to a duty on the part of the Owner to exercise this right for the 
benefit of the Contractor or any other person or entity, except to the 
extent required by Section 6.1.3.
 
§ 2.4 OWNERS RIGHT TO CARRY OUT THE WORK
 
§ 2.4.1 If the Contractor defaults or neglects to carry out the Work in 
accordance with the Contract Documents and fails within a seven-day period 
after receipt of written notice from the Owner to commence and continue 
correction of such default or neglect with diligence and promptness, the 
Owner may after such seven-day period give the Contractor a second written 
notice to correct such deficiencies within a three-day period. If the 
Contractor within such three-day period after receipt of such second notice 
fails to commence and continue to correct any deficiencies, the Owner may, 
without prejudice to other remedies the Owner may have, correct such 
deficiencies. In such case an appropriate Change Order shall be issued 
deducting from payments then or thereafter due the Contractor the 
reasonable cost of correcting such deficiencies, including Owners expenses 
and compensation for the Architects additional services made necessary by 
such default, neglect or failure. Such action by the Owner and amounts 
charged to the Contractor arc both subject to prior approval of the 
Architect. If payments then or thereafter due the Contractor are not 
sufficient to cover such amounts, the Contractor shall pay the difference 
to the Owner.

Work, as well as the information furnished by the Owner pursuant to Section 
2.2.3, shall take field measurements of any existing conditions related to 
that portion of the Work and shall observe any conditions at the site 
affecting it. These obligations are for the purpose of facilitating 
construction by the Contractor and are not for the purpose of discovering 
errors, omissions, or inconsistencies in the Contract Documents; however, 
any errors, inconsistencies or omissions discovered by the Contractor shall 
be reported promptly to the Architect as a request for information in such 
form as the Architect may require.
 
§ 3.2.2 Any design errors or omissions noted by the Contractor during this 
review shall be reported promptly to the Architect, but it is recognized 
that the Contractors review is made in the Contractors capacity as a 
contractor and not as a licensed design professional unless otherwise 
specifically provided in the Contract Documents. The Contractor is not 
required to ascertain that the Contract Documents are in accordance with 
applicable laws, statutes, ordinances, building codes, and rules and 
regulations, but any nonconformity discovered by or made known to the 
Contractor shall be reported promptly to the Architect.
 
§ 3.2.3 If the Contractor believes that additional cost or time is involved 
because of clarifications or instructions issued by the Architect in 
response to the Contractors notices or requests for information pursuant 
to Sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2, the Contractor shall make Claims as provided 
in Sections 4.3.6 and 4.3.7. If the Contractor fails to perform the 
obligations of Sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2, the Contractor shall pay such 
costs and damages to the Owner as would have been avoided if the Contractor 
had performed such obligations. The Contractor shall not be liable to the 
Owner or Architect for damages resulting from errors, inconsistencies or 
omissions in the Contract Documents or for differences between field 
measurements or conditions and the Contract Documents unless the Contractor 
recognized such error, inconsistency, omission or difference and knowingly 
failed to report it to the Architect.
 
§ 3.3 SUPERVISION AND CONSTRUCTION PROCEDURES
 
§ 3.3.1 The Contractor shall supervise and direct the Work, using the 
Contractors best skill and attention. The Contractor shall be solely 
responsible for and have control over construction means, methods, 
techniques, sequences and procedures and for coordinating all portions of 
the Work under the Contract, unless the Contract Documents give other 
specific instructions concerning these matters. If the Contract Documents 
give specific instructions concerning construction means, methods, 
techniques, sequences or procedures, the Contractor shall evaluate the 
jobsite safety thereof and, except as stated below, shall be fully and 
solely responsible for the jobsite safety of such means, methods, 
techniques, sequences or procedures. If the Contractor determines that such 
means, methods, techniques, sequences or procedures may not be safe, the 
Contractor shall give timely written notice to the Owner and Architect and 
shall not proceed with that portion of the Work without further written 
instructions from the Architect. If the Contractor is then instructed to 
proceed with the required means, methods, techniques, sequences or 
procedures without acceptance of changes proposed by the Contractor, the 
Owner shall be solely responsible for any resulting loss or damage.
 
§ 3.3.2 The Contractor shall be responsible to the Owner for acts and 
omissions of the Contractors employees, Subcontractors and their agents 
and employees, and other persons or entities performing portions of the 
Work for or on behalf of the Contractor or any of its Subcontractors.

Work already performed to determine that such portions are in proper 
condition to receive subsequent Work.

shall provide and pay for labor, materials, equipment, tools, construction 
equipment and machinery, water, heat, utilities, transportation, and other 
facilities and services necessary for proper execution and completion of 
the Work, whether temporary or permanent and whether or not incorporated or 
to be incorporated in the Work.
 
§ 3.4.2 The Contractor may make substitutions only with the consent of the 
Owner, after evaluation by the Architect and in accordance with a Change 
Order.
 
§ 3.4.3 The Contractor shall enforce strict discipline and good order among 
the Contractors employees, subcontractors, and other persons carrying out 
the Contract. The Contractor shall not permit employment of unfit persons 
or persons not skilled in tasks assigned to them.

shall be available to the Architect and shall be delivered to the Architect 
for submittal to the Owner upon completion of the Work.
 
§ 3.12 SHOP DRAWINGS, PRODUCT DATA AND SAMPLES

§ 3.12.4 Shop Drawings, Product Data, Samples and similar submittals are 
not Contract Documents. The purpose of their submittal is to demonstrate 
for those portions of the Work for which submittals are required by the 
Contract Documents the way by which the Contractor proposes to conform to 
the information given and the design concept expressed in the Contract 
Documents. Review by the Architect is subject to the limitations of Section

action.
 
§ 3.12.6 By approving and submitting Shop Drawings, Product Data, Samples 
and similar submittals, the Contractor represents that the Contractor has 
determined and verified materials, field measurements and field 
construction criteria related thereto, or will do so, and has checked and 
coordinated the information contained within such submittals with the 
requirements of the Work and of the Contract Documents.

§ 3.12.7 The Contractor shall perform no portion of the Work for which the 
Contract Documents require submittal and review of Shop Drawings, Product 
Data, Samples or similar submittals until the respective submittal has been 
approved by the Architect.
 
§ 3.12.8 The Work shall be in accordance with approved submittals except 
that the Contractor shall not be relieved of responsibility for deviations 
from requirements of the Contract Documents by the Architects approval of 
Shop Drawings, Product Data, Samples or similar submittals unless the 
Contractor has specifically informed the Architect in writing of such 
deviation at the time of submittal and (1) the Architect has given written 
approval to the specific deviation as a minor change in the Work, or (2) a 
Change Order or Construction Change Directive has been issued authorizing 
the deviation. The Contractor shall not be relieved of responsibility for 
errors or omissions in Shop Drawings, Product Data, Samples or similar 
submittals by the Architects approval thereof.
 
§ 3.12.9 The Contractor shall direct specific attention, in writing or on 
resubmitted Shop Drawings, Product Data, Samples or similar submittals, to 
revisions other than those requested by the Architect on previous 
submittals. In the absence of such written notice the Architects approval 
of a resubmission shall not apply to such revisions.
 
§ 3.12.10 The Contractor shall not be required to provide professional 
services which constitute the practice of architecture or engineering 
unless such services are specifically required by the Contract Documents

construction means, methods, techniques, sequences and procedures. The 
Contractor shall not be required to provide professional services in 
violation of applicable law. If professional design services or 
certifications by a design professional related to systems, materials or 
equipment are specifically required of the Contractor by the Contract 
Documents, the Owner and the Architect will specify all performance and 
design criteria that such services must satisfy. The Contractor shall cause 
such services or certifications to be provided by a properly licensed 
design professional, whose signature and seal shall appear on all drawings, 
calculations, specifications, certifications, Shop Drawings and other 
submittals prepared by such professional. Shop Drawings and other 
submittals related to the Work designed or certified by such professional, 
if prepared by others, shall bear such professionals written approval when 
submitted to the Architect. The Owner and the Architect shall be entitled 
to rely upon the adequacy, accuracy and completeness of the services, 
certifications or approvals performed by such design professionals, 
provided the Owner and Architect have specified to the Contractor all 
performance and design criteria that such services must satisfy. Pursuant 
to this Section 3.12.10, the Architect will review, approve or take other 
appropriate action on submittals only for the limited purpose of checking 
for conformance with information given and the design concept expressed in 
the Contract Documents. The Contractor shall not be responsible for the 
adequacy of the performance or design criteria required by the Contract 
Documents.

or by excavation. The Contractor shall not cut or otherwise alter such 
construction by the Owner or a separate contractor except with written 
consent of the Owner and of such separate contractor; such consent shall 
not be unreasonably withheld. The Contractor shall not unreasonably 
withhold from the Owner or a separate contractor the Contractors consent 
to cutting or otherwise altering the Work.
 
§ 3.15 CLEANING UP
 
§ 3.15.1 The Contractor shall keep the premises and surrounding area free 
from accumulation of waste materials or rubbish caused by operations under

Contractor shall defend suits or claims for infringement of copyrights and 
patent rights and shall hold the Owner and Architect harmless from loss on 
account thereof, but shall not be responsible for such defense or loss when 
a particular design, process or product of a particular manufacturer or 
manufacturers is required by the Contract Documents or where the copyright 
violations are contained in Drawings, Specifications or other documents 
prepared by the Owner or Architect. However, if the Contractor has reason 
to believe that the required design, process or product is an infringement

Owner, Architect, Architects consultants, and agents and employees of any 
of them from and against claims, damages, losses and expenses, including 
but not limited to attorneys fees, arising out of or resulting from 
performance of the Work, provided that such claim, damage, loss or expense 
is attributable to bodily injury, sickness, disease or death, or to injury 
to or destruction of tangible property (other than the Work itself), but 
only to the extent caused by the negligent acts or omissions of the 
Contractor, a Subcontractor, anyone directly or indirectly employed by them 
or anyone for whose acts they may be liable, regardless of whether or not 
such claim, damage, loss or expense is caused in part by a party 
indemnified hereunder. Such obligation shall not be construed to negate, 
abridge, or reduce other rights or obligations of indemnity which would 
otherwise exist as to a party or person described in this Section 3.18.
 
§ 3.18.2 In claims against any person or entity indemnified under this 
Section 3.18 by an employee of the Contractor, a Subcontractor, anyone 
directly or indirectly employed by them or anyone for whose acts they may 
be liable, the indemnification obligation under Section 3.18.1 shall not be 
limited by a limitation on amount or type of damages, compensation or 
benefits payable by or for the Contractor or a Subcontractor under workers 
compensation acts, disability benefit acts or other employee benefit acts.

exhaustive or continuous on-site inspections to check the quality or 
quantity of the Work. The Architect will neither have control over or 
charge of, nor be responsible for, the construction means, methods, 
techniques, sequences or procedures, or for the safety precautions and 
programs in connection with the Work, since these are solely the 
Contractors rights and responsibilities under the Contract Documents, 
except as provided in Section 3.3.1.
 
§ 4.2.3 The Architect will not be responsible for the Contractors failure 
to perform the Work in accordance with the requirements of the Contract 
Documents. The Architect will not have control over or charge of and will 
not be responsible for acts or omissions of the Contractor, Subcontractors, 
or their agents or employees, or any other persons or entities performing 
portions of the Work.
 
§ 4.2.4 Communications Facilitating Contract Administration. Except as 
otherwise provided in the Contract Documents or when direct communications 
have been specially authorized, the Owner and Contractor shall endeavor to 
communicate with each other through the Architect about matters arising out 
of or relating to the Contract. Communications by and with the Architects 
consultants shall be through the Architect. Communications by and with 
Subcontractors and material suppliers shall be through the Contractor. 
Communications by and with separate contractors shall be through the Owner.
 
§ 4.2.5 Based on the Architects evaluations of the Contractors 
Applications for Payment, the Architect will review and certify the amounts 
due the Contractor and will issue Certificates for Payment in such amounts.
 
§ 4.2.6 The Architect will have authority to reject Work that does not 
conform to the Contract Documents. Whenever the Architect considers it 
necessary or advisable, the Architect will have authority to require 
inspection or testing of the Work in accordance with Sections 13.5.2 and 
13.5.3, whether or not such Work is fabricated, installed or completed. 
However, neither this authority of the Architect nor a decision made in 
good faith either to exercise or not to exercise such authority shall give 
rise to a duty or responsibility of the Architect to the Contractor, 
Subcontractors, material and equipment suppliers, their agents or 
employees, or other persons or entities performing portions of the Work.
 
§ 4.2.7 The Architect will review and approve or take other appropriate 
action upon the Contractors stibmittals such as Shop Drawings, Product 
Data and Samples, but only for the limited purpose of checking for 
conformance with information given and the design concept expressed in the 
Contract Documents. The Architects action will be taken with such 
reasonable promptness as to cause no delay in the Work or in the activities 
of the Owner, Contractor or separate contractors, while allowing sufficient 
time in the Architects professional judgment to permit adequate review. 
Review of such submittals is not conducted for the purpose of determining 
the accuracy and completeness of other details such as dimensions and 
quantities, or for substantiating instructions for installation or 
performance of equipment or systems, all of which remain the responsibility 
of the Contractor as required by the Contract Documents. The Architects 
review of the Contractors submittals shall not relieve the Contractor of 
the obligations under Sections 3.3, 3.5 and 3.12. The Architects review 
shall not constitute approval of safety precautions or, unless otherwise 
specifically stated by the Architect, of any construction means, methods, 
techniques, sequences or procedures. The Architects approval of a specific 
item shall not indicate approval of an assembly of which the item is a 
component.
 
§ 4.2.8 The Architect will prepare Change Orders and Construction Change 
Directives, and may authorize minor changes in the Work as provided in 
Section 7.4.
 
§ 4.2.9 The Architect will conduct inspections to determine (after review 
and approval by the Owners Construction Manager) the date or dates of 
Substantial Completion and the date of final completion, will receive and 
forward to the Owner, for the Owners review and records, written 
warranties and related documents required by the Contract

and assembled by the Contractor, and will issue a final Certificate for 
Payment upon compliance with the requirements of the Contract Documents.
 
§ 4.2.10 If the Owner and Architect agree, the Architect will provide one 
or more project representatives to assist in carrying out the Architects 
responsibilities at the site. The duties, responsibilities and limitations 
of authority of such project representatives shall be as set forth in an 
exhibit to be incorporated in the Contract Documents.
 
§ 4.2.11 The Architect will interpret and decide matters concerning 
performance under and requirements of, the Contract Documents on written 
request of either the Owner or Contractor. The Architects response to such 
requests will be made in writing within any time limits agreed upon or 
otherwise with reasonable promptness. If no agreement is made concerning 
the time within which interpretations required of the Architect shall be 
furnished in compliance with this Section 4.2, then delay shall not be 
recognized on account of failure by the Architect to furnish such 
interpretations until 15 days after written request is made for them.
 
§ 4.2.12 Interpretations and decisions of the Architect will be consistent 
with the intent of and reasonably inferable from the Contract Documents and 
will be in writing or in the form of drawings. When making such 
interpretations and initial decisions, the Architect will endeavor to 
secure faithful performance by both Owner and Contractor, will not show 
partiality to either and will not be liable for results of interpretations 
or decisions so rendered in good faith.
 
§ 4.2.13 The Architects decisions on matters relating to aesthetic effect 
will be final if consistent with the intent expressed in the Contract 
Documents.
 
§ 4.3 CLAIMS AND DISPUTES
 
§ 4.3.1 Definition. A Claim is a demand or assertion by one of the parties 
seeking, as a matter of right, adjustment or interpretation of Contract 
terms, payment of money, extension of time or other relief with respect to 
the terms of the Contract. The term Claim also includes other disputes 
and matters in question between the Owner and Contractor arising out of or 
relating to the Contract. Claims must be initiated by written notice. The 
responsibility to substantiate Claims shall rest with the party making the 
Claim.
 
§ 4.3.2 Time Limits on Claims. Claims by cither party must be initiated 
within 21 days after occurrence of the event giving rise to such Claim or 
within 21 days after the claimant first recognizes the condition giving 
rise to the Claim, whichever is later. Claims must be initiated by written 
notice to the Architect and the other party.
 
§ 4.3.3 Continuing Contract Performance. Pending final resolution of a 
Claim except as otherwise agreed in writing or as provided in Section 9.7.1 
and Article 14, the Contractor shall proceed diligently with performance of 
the Contract and the Owner shall continue to make payments in accordance 
with the Contract Documents.
 
§ 4.3.4 Claims for Concealed or Unknown Conditions. If conditions are 
encountered at the site which are (1) subsurface or otherwise concealed 
physical conditions which differ materially from those indicated in the 
Contract Documents or (2) unknown physical conditions of an unusual nature, 
which differ materially from those ordinarily found to exist and generally 
recognized as inherent in construction activities of the character provided 
for in the Contract Documents, then notice by the observing party shall be 
given to the other party promptly before conditions are disturbed and in no 
event later than 21 days after first observance of the conditions. The 
Architect will promptly investigate such conditions and, if they differ 
materially and cause an increase or decrease in the Contractors cost of, 
or time required for, performance of any part of the Work, will recommend 
an equitable adjustment in the Contract Sum or Contract Time, or both. If 
the Architect determines that the conditions at the site are not materially 
different from those indicated in the Contract Documents and that no change 
in the terms of the Contract is justified, the Architect shall so notify 
the Owner and Contractor in writing, stating the reasons. Claims by either 
party in opposition to such determination must be made within 21 days after 
the Architect has given notice of the decision. If the conditions 
encountered arc materially different, the Contract Sum and Contract Time 
shall be equitably adjusted, but if the Owner and Contractor cannot agree 
on an adjustment in the Contract Sum or Contract Time, the adjustment shall 
be referred to the Architect for initial determination, subject to further 
proceedings pursuant to Section 4.4.
 
§ 4.3.5 Claims for Additional Cost. If the Contractor wishes to make Claim 
for an increase in the Contract Sum, written notice as provided herein 
shall be given before proceeding to execute the Work. Prior notice is not 
required for Claims relating to an emergency endangering life or property 
arising under Section 10.6.

§ 4.3.6 If the Contractor believes additional cost is involved for reasons 
including but not limited to (1) a written interpretation from the 
Architect, (2) an order by the Owner to stop the Work where the Contractor 
was not at fault, (3) a written order for a minor change in the Work issued 
by the Architect, (4) failure of payment by the Owner, (5) termination of 
the Contract by the Owner, (6) Owners suspension or (7) other reasonable 
grounds, Claim shall be filed in accordance with this Section 4.3.
 
§ 4.3.7 Claims for Additional Time
 
§ 4.3.7.1 If the Contractor wishes to make Claim for an increase in the 
Contract Time, written notice as provided herein shall be given. The 
Contractors Claim shall include an estimate of cost and of probable effect 
of delay on progress of the Work. In the case of a continuing delay only 
one Claim is necessary.
 
§ 4.3.7.2 If adverse weather conditions are the basis for a Claim for 
additional time, such Claim shall be documented by data substantiating that 
weather conditions were abnormal for the period of time, could not have 
been reasonably anticipated and had an adverse effect on the scheduled 
construction.
 
§ 4.3.8 Injury or Damage to Person or Property. If either party to the 
Contract suffers injury or damage to person or property because of an act 
or omission of the other party, or of others for whose acts such party is 
legally responsible, written notice of such injury or damage, whether or 
not insured, shall be given to the other party within a reasonable time not 
exceeding 21 days after discovery. The notice shall provide sufficient 
detail to enable the other party to investigate the matter.
 
§ 4.3.9 If unit prices are stated in the Contract Documents or subsequently 
agreed upon, and if quantities originally contemplated are materially 
changed in a proposed Change Order or Construction Change Directive so that 
application of such unit prices to quantities of Work proposed will cause 
substantial inequity to the Owner or Contractor, the applicable unit prices 
shall be equitably adjusted.
 
§ 4.3.10 Claims for Consequential Damages. The Contractor and Owner waive 
Claims against each other for consequential damages arising out of or 
relating to this Contract. This mutual waiver includes:
 
     .1                        damages incurred by the Owner for rental
     expenses, for losses of use, income, profit, financing, business and
     reputation, and for loss of management or employee productivity or of
     the services of such persons; and
     .2                        damages incurred by the Contractor for
     principal office expenses including the compensation of personnel
     stationed there, for losses of financing, business and reputation, and
     for loss of profit except anticipated profit arising directly from the
     Work.
      
This mutual waiver is applicable, without limitation, to all consequential 
damages due to either partys termination in accordance with Article 14. 
Nothing contained in this Section 4.3.10 shall be deemed to preclude an 
award of liquidated direct damages, when applicable, in accordance with the 
requirements of the Contract Documents.
 
§ 4.4 RESOLUTION OF CLAIMS AND DISPUTES
 
§ 4.4.1 Decision of Architect. Claims, including those alleging an error or 
omission by the Architect but excluding those arising under Sections 10.3 
through 10.5, shall be referred initially to the Architect for decision. An 
initial decision by the Architect shall be required as a condition 
precedent to mediation, arbitration or litigation of all Claims between the 
Contractor and Owner arising prior to the date final payment is due, unless 
30 days have passed after the Claim has been referred to the Architect with 
no decision having been rendered by the Architect. The Architect will not 
decide disputes between the Contractor and persons or entities other than 
the Owner.
 
§ 4.4.2 The Architect will review Claims and within ten days of the receipt 
of the Claim take one or more of the following actions: (1) request 
additional supporting data from the claimant or a response with supporting 
data from the other party, (2) reject the Claim in whole or in part, (3) 
approve the Claim, (4) suggest a compromise, or (5) advise the parties that 
the Architect is unable to resolve the Claim if the Architect lacks 
sufficient information to evaluate the merits of the Claim or if the 
Architect concludes that, in the Architects sole discretion, it would be 
inappropriate for the Architect to resolve the Claim.

§ 4.4.3 In evaluating Claims, the Architect may, but shall not be obligated 
to, consult with or seek information from either party or from persons with 
special knowledge or expertise who may assist the Architect in rendering a 
decision. The Architect may request the Owner to authorize retention of 
such persons at the Owners expense.
 
§ 4.4.4 If the Architect requests a party to provide a response to a Claim 
or to furnish additional supporting data, such party shall respond, within 
ten days after receipt of such request, and shall either provide a response 
on the requested supporting data, advise the Architect when the response or 
supporting data will be furnished or advise the Architect that no 
supporting data will be furnished. Upon receipt of the response or 
supporting data, if any, the Architect will either reject or approve the 
Claim in whole or in part.
 
§ 4.4.5 The Architect will approve or reject Claims by written decision, 
which shall state the reasons therefor and which shall notify the parties 
of any change in the Contract Sum or Contract Time or both. The approval or 
rejection of a Claim by the Architect shall be final and binding on the 
parties but subject to mediation and arbitration.
 
§ 4.4.6 When a written decision of the Architect states that (1) the 
decision is final but subject to mediation and arbitration and (2) a demand 
for arbitration of a Claim covered by such decision must be made within 30 
days after the date on which the party making the demand receives the final 
written decision, then failure to demand arbitration within said 30 days 
period shall result in the Architects decision becoming final and binding 
upon the Owner and Contractor. If the Architect renders a decision after 
arbitration proceedings have been initiated, such decision may be entered 
as evidence, but shall not supersede arbitration proceedings unless the 
decision is acceptable to all parties concerned.
 
§ 4.4.7 Upon receipt of a Claim against the Contractor or at any time 
thereafter, the Architect or the Owner may, but is not obligated to, notify 
the surety, if any, of the nature and amount of the Claim. If the Claim 
relates to a possibility of a Contractors default, the Architect or the 
Owner may, but is not obligated to, notify the surety and request the 
suretys assistance in resolving the controversy.
 
§ 4.4.8 If a Claim relates to or is the subject of a mechanics lien, the 
party asserting such Claim may proceed in accordance with applicable law to 
comply with the lien notice or filing deadlines prior to resolution of the 
Claim by the Architect, by mediation or by arbitration.
 
§ 4.5 MEDIATION
 
§ 4.5.1 Any Claim arising out of or related to the Contract, except Claims 
relating to aesthetic effect and except those waived as provided for in 
Sections 4.3.10, 9.10.4 and 9.10.5 shall, after initial decision by the 
Architect or 30 days after submission of the Claim to the Architect, be 
subject to mediation as a condition precedent to arbitration or the 
institution of legal or equitable proceedings by either party.
 
§ 4.5.2 The parties shall endeavor to resolve their Claims by mediation 
which, unless the parties mutually agree otherwise, shall be in accordance 
with the Construction Industry Mediation Rules of the American Arbitration 
Association currently in effect. Request for mediation shall be filed in 
writing with the other party to the Contract and with the American 
Arbitration Association. The request may be made concurrently with the 
filing of a demand for arbitration but, in such event, mediation shall 
proceed in advance of arbitration or legal or equitable proceedings, which 
shall be stayed pending mediation for a period of 60 days from the date of 
filing, unless stayed for a longer period by agreement of the parties or 
court order.
 
§ 4.5.3 The parties shall share the mediators fee and any filing fees 
equally. The mediation shall be held in the place where the Project is 
located, unless another location is mutually agreed upon. Agreements 
reached in mediation shall be enforceable as settlement agreements in any 
court having jurisdiction thereof.
 
§ 4.6 ARBITRATION
 
§ 4.6.1 Any Claim arising out of or related to the Contract, except Claims 
relating to aesthetic effect and except those waived as provided for in 
Sections 4.3.10, 9.10.4 and 9.10.5, shall, after decision by the Architect 
or 30 days after submission of the Claim to the Architect, be subject to 
arbitration. Prior to arbitration, the parties shall endeavor to resolve 
disputes by mediation in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.5.
 
§ 4.6.2 Claims not resolved by mediation shall be decided by arbitration 
which, unless the parties mutually agree otherwise, shall be in accordance 
with the Construction Industry Arbitration Rules of the American 
Arbitration

Association currently in effect. The demand for arbitration shall be filed 
in writing with the other party to the Contract and with the American 
Arbitration Association, and a copy shall be filed with the Architect.
 
§ 4.6.3 A demand for arbitration shall be made within the time limits 
specified in Sections 4.4.6 and 4.6.1 as applicable, and in other cases 
within a reasonable time after the Claim has arisen, and in no event shall 
it be made after the date when institution of legal or equitable 
proceedings based on such Claim would be barred by the applicable statute 
of limitations as determined pursuant to Section 13.7.
 
§ 4.6.4 Limitation on Consolidation or Joinder. No arbitration arising out 
of or relating to the Contract shall include, by consolidation or joinder 
or in any other manner, the Architect, the Architects employees or 
consultants, except by written consent containing specific reference to the 
Agreement and signed by the Architect, Owner, Contractor, Owners 
Construction Manager and any other person or entity sought to be joined. No 
arbitration shall include, by consolidation or joinder or in any other 
manner, parties other than the Owner, Contractor, Owners Construction 
Manager, a separate contractor as described in Article 6 and other persons 
substantially involved in a common question of fact or law whose presence 
is required if complete relief is to be accorded in arbitration. No person 
or entity other than the Owner, Contractor or a separate contractor as 
described in Article 6 shall be included as an original third party or 
additional third party to an arbitration whose interest or responsibility 
is insubstantial. Consent to arbitration involving an additional person or 
entity shall not constitute consent to arbitration of a Claim not described 
therein or with a person or entity not named or described therein. The 
foregoing agreement to arbitrate and other agreements to arbitrate with an 
additional person or entity duly consented to by parties to the Agreement 
shall be specifically enforceable under applicable law in any court having 
jurisdiction thereof.
 
§ 4.6.5 Claims and Timely Assertion of Claims. The party filing a notice of 
demand for arbitration must assert in the demand all Claims then known to 
that party on which arbitration is permitted to be demanded.

arbitrators shall be final, and judgment may be entered upon it in 
accordance with applicable law in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
 
ARTICLE 5 SUBCONTRACTORS
 
§ 5.1 DEFINITIONS
 
§ 5.1.1 A Subcontractor is a person or entity who has a direct contract 
with the Contractor to perform a portion of the Work at the site. The term 
Subcontractor is referred to throughout the Contract Documents as if 
singular in number and means a Subcontractor or an authorized 
representative of the Subcontractor. The term Subcontractor does not 
include a separate contractor or subcontractors of a separate contractor.
 
§ 5.1.2 A Sub-subcontractor is a person or entity who has a direct or 
indirect contract with a Subcontractor to perform a portion of the Work at 
the site. The term Sub-subcontractor is referred to throughout the 
Contract Documents as if singular in number and means a Sub-subcontractor 
or an authorized representative of the Sub-subcontractor.
 
5.1.3 Divisions and/or affiliates identified in Section 10.4 of the 
Agreement, if any, will be treated as a separate Subcontractor. Any other 
Division or affiliates will be subject by approval by the Owner, which 
approval shall not be unreasonably delayed or withheld.
 
§ 5.2 AWARD OF SUBCONTRACTS AND OTHER CONTRACTS FOR PORTIONS OF THE WORK
 
§ 5.2.1 Unless otherwise stated in the Contract Documents or the bidding 
requirements, the Contractor, as soon as practicable after award of the 
Contract, shall furnish in writing to the Owner through the Architect the 
names of persons or entities (including those who are to furnish materials 
or equipment fabricated to a special design) proposed for each principal 
portion of the Work. The Architect will promptly reply to the Contractor in 
writing stating whether or not the Owner or the Architect, after due 
investigation, has reasonable objection to any such proposed person or 
entity. Failure of the Owner or Architect to reply promptly shall 
constitute notice of no reasonable objection.
 
§ 5.2.2 The Contractor shall not contract with a proposed person or entity 
to whom the Owner or Architect has made reasonable and timely objection. 
The Contractor shall not be required to contract with anyone to whom the 
Contractor has made reasonable objection.

§ 5.2.3 If the Owner or Architect has reasonable objection to a person or 
entity proposed by the Contractor, the Contractor shall propose another to 
whom the Owner or Architect has no reasonable objection. If the proposed 
but rejected Subcontractor was reasonably capable of performing the Work, 
the Contract Sum and Contract Time shall be increased or decreased by the 
difference, if any, occasioned by such change, and an appropriate Change 
Order shall be issued before commencement of the substitute Subcontractors 
Work. However, no increase in the Contract Sum or Contract Time shall be 
allowed for such change unless the Contractor has acted promptly and 
responsively in submitting names as required.
 
§ 5.2.4 The Contractor shall not change a Subcontractor, person or entity 
previously selected if the Owner or Architect makes reasonable objection to 
such substitute.
 
§ 5.3 SUBCONTRACTUAL RELATIONS
 
§ 5.3.1 By appropriate agreement, written where legally required for 
validity, the Contractor shall require each Subcontractor, to the extent of 
the Work to be performed by the Subcontractor, to be bound to the 
Contractor by terms of the Contract Documents, and to assume toward the 
Contractor all the obligations and responsibilities, including the 
responsibility for safety of the Subcontractors Work, which the 
Contractor, by these Documents, assumes toward the Owner and Architect. 
Each subcontract agreement shall preserve and protect the rights of the 
Owner and Architect under the Contract Documents with respect to the Work 
to be performed by the Subcontractor so that subcontracting thereof will 
not prejudice such rights, and shall allow to the Subcontractor, unless 
specifically provided otherwise in the subcontract agreement, the benefit 
of all rights, remedies and redress against the Contractor that the 
Contractor, by the Contract Documents, has against the Owner. Where 
appropriate, the Contractor shall require each Subcontractor to enter into 
similar agreements with Sub-subcontractors. The Contractor shall make 
available to each proposed Subcontractor, prior to the execution of the 
subcontract agreement, copies of the Contract Documents to which the 
Subcontractor will be bound, and, upon written request of the 
Subcontractor, identify to the Subcontractor terms and conditions of the 
proposed subcontract agreement which may be at variance with the Contract 
Documents. Subcontractors will similarly make copies of applicable portions 
of such documents available to their respective proposed 
Sub-subcontractors.
 
§ 5.4 CONTINGENT ASSIGNMENT OF SUBCONTRACTS
 
§ 5.4.1 Each subcontract agreement for a portion of the Work is assigned by 
the Contractor to the Owner provided that:
 
     .1                        assignment is effective only after
     termination of the Contract by the Owner for cause pursuant to Section
     14.2 and only for those subcontract agreements which the Owner accepts
     by notifying the Subcontractor and Contractor in writing; and
     .2                        assignment is subject to the prior rights of
     the surety, if any, obligated under bond relating to the Contract.
      
§ 5.4.2 Upon such assignment, if the Work has been suspended for more than 
30 days, the Subcontractors compensation shall be equitably adjusted for 
increases in cost resulting from the suspension.
 
ARTICLE 6 CONSTRUCTION BY OWNER OR BY SEPARATE CONTRACTORS
 
§ 6.1 OWNERS RIGHT TO PERFORM CONSTRUCTION AND TO AWARD SEPARATE CONTRACTS
 
§ 6.1.1 The Owner reserves the right to perform construction or operations 
related to the Project with the Owners own forces, and to award separate 
contracts in connection with other portions of the Project or other 
construction or operations on the site under Conditions of the Contract 
identical or substantially similar to these including those portions 
related to insurance and waiver of subrogation. If the Contractor claims 
that delay or additional cost is involved because of such action by the 
Owner, the Contractor shall make such Claim as provided in Section 4.3.
 
§ 6.1.2 When separate contracts are awarded for different portions of the 
Project or other construction or operations on the site, the term 
Contractor in the Contract Documents in each case shall mean the 
Contractor who executes each separate Owner-Contractor Agreement.
 
§ 6.1.3 The Owner shall provide for coordination of the activities of the 
Owners own forces and of each separate contractor with the Work of the 
Contractor, who shall cooperate with them. The Contractor shall participate 
with other separate contractors and the Owner in reviewing their 
construction schedules when directed to do so. The Contractor shall make 
any revisions to the construction schedule deemed necessary after a joint 
review and mutual

agreement. The construction schedules shall then constitute the schedules 
to be used by the Contractor, separate contractors and the Owner until 
subsequently revised.
 
§ 6.1.4 Unless otherwise provided in the Contract Documents, when the Owner 
performs construction or operations related to the Project with the Owners 
own forces, the Owner shall be deemed to be subject to the same obligations 
and to have the same rights which apply to the Contractor under the 
Conditions of the Contract, including, without excluding others, those 
stated in Article 3, this Article 6 and Articles 10, 11 and 12.
 
§ 6.2 MUTUAL RESPONSIBILITY
 
§ 6.2.1 The Contractor shall afford the Owner and separate contractors 
reasonable opportunity for introduction and storage of their materials and 
equipment and performance of their activities, and shall connect and 
coordinate the Contractors construction and operations with theirs as 
required by the Contract Documents.
 
§ 6.2.2 If part of the Contractors Work depends for proper execution or 
results upon construction or operations by the Owner or a separate 
contractor, the Contractor shall, prior to proceeding with that portion of 
the Work, promptly report to the Architect apparent discrepancies or 
defects in such other construction that would render it unsuitable for such 
proper execution and results. Failure of the Contractor so to report shall 
constitute an acknowledgment that the Owners or separate contractors 
completed or partially completed construction is fit and proper to receive 
the Contractors Work, except as to defects not then reasonably 
discoverable.
 
§ 6.2.3 The Owner shall be reimbursed by the Contractor for costs incurred 
by the Owner which are payable to a separate contractor because of delays, 
improperly timed activities or defective construction of the Contractor. 
The Owner shall be responsible to the Contractor for costs incurred by the 
Contractor because of delays, improperly timed activities, damage to the 
Work or defective construction of a separate contractor.
 
§ 6.2.4 The Contractor shall promptly remedy damage wrongfully caused by 
the Contractor to completed or partially completed construction or to 
property of the Owner or separate contractors as provided in Section 
10.2.5.
 
§ 6.2.5 The Owner and each separate contractor shall have the same 
responsibilities for cutting and patching as are described for the 
Contractor in Section 3.14.
 
§ 6.3 OWNERS RIGHT TO CLEAN UP
 
§ 6.3.1 If a dispute arises among the Contractor, separate contractors and 
the Owner as to the responsibility under their respective contracts for 
maintaining the premises and surrounding area free from waste materials and 
rubbish, the Owner may clean up and the Architect will allocate the cost 
among those responsible.
 
ARTICLE 7 CHANGES IN THE WORK
 
§ 7.1 GENERAL
 
§ 7.1.1 Changes in the Work may be accomplished after execution of the 
Contract, and without invalidating the Contract, by Change Order, 
Construction Change Directive or order for a minor change in the Work, 
subject to the limitations stated in this Article 7 and elsewhere in the 
Contract Documents.
 
§ 7.1.2 A Change Order shall be based upon agreement among the Owner, 
Contractor and Architect; a Construction Change Directive requires 
agreement by the Owner and Architect and may or may not be agreed to by the 
Contractor; an order for a minor change in the Work may be issued by the 
Architect alone.
 
§ 7.1.3 Changes in the Work shall be performed under applicable provisions 
of the Contract Documents, and the Contractor shall proceed promptly, 
unless otherwise provided in the Change Order, Construction Change 
Directive or order for a minor change in the Work.

§ 7.2.2 Methods used in determining adjustments to the Contract Sum may 
include those listed in Section 7.3.3.
 
§ 7.3 CONSTRUCTION CHANGE DIRECTIVES
 
§ 7.3.1 A Construction Change Directive is a written order prepared by the 
Architect and signed by the Owner and Architect, directing a change in the 
Work prior to agreement on adjustment, if any, in the Contract Sum or 
Contract Time, or both. The Owner may by Construction Change Directive, 
without invalidating the Contract, order changes in the Work within the 
general scope of the Contract consisting of additions, deletions or other 
revisions, the Contract Sum and Contract Time being adjusted accordingly.
 
§ 7.3.2 A Construction Change Directive shall be used in the absence of 
total agreement on the terms of a Change Order.
 
§ 7.3.3 If the Construction Change Directive provides for an adjustment to 
the Contract Sum, the adjustment shall be based on one of the following 
methods:
 
     .1                        mutual acceptance of a lump sum properly
     itemized and supported by sufficient substantiating data to permit
     evaluation;
     .2                        unit prices stated in the Contract Documents
     or subsequently agreed upon;
     .3                        cost to be determined in a manner agreed
     upon by the parties and a mutually acceptable fixed or percentage fee;
     or
     .4                        as provided in Section 7.3.6.
      
§ 7.3.4 Upon receipt of a Construction Change Directive, the Contractor 
shall promptly proceed with the change in the Work involved and advise the 
Architect of the Contractors agreement or disagreement with the method, if 
any, provided in the Construction Change Directive for determining the 
proposed adjustment in the Contract Sum or Contract Time.
 
§ 7.3.5 A Construction Change Directive signed by the Contractor indicates 
the agreement of the Contractor therewith, including adjustment in Contract 
Sum and Contract Time or the method for determining them. Such agreement 
shall be effective immediately and shall be recorded as a Change Order.
 
§ 7.3.6 If the Contractor does not respond promptly or disagrees with the 
method for adjustment in the Contract Sum, the method and the adjustment 
shall be determined by the Architect on the basis of reasonable 
expenditures and savings of those performing the Work attributable to the 
change, including, the Contractors Fee computed on the cost of the work at 
the rate stated in Section 5.1.2 of the Agreement in case of an increase in 
the Contract Sum, a reasonable allowance for overhead and profit. In such 
case, and also under Section 7.3.3.3, the Contractor shall keep and 
present, in such form as the Architect may prescribe, an itemized 
accounting together with appropriate supporting data. Unless otherwise 
provided in the Contract Documents, costs for the purposes of this Section 
7.3.6 shall be limited to the following;
 
     .1                        costs of labor, including social security,
     old age and unemployment insurance, fringe benefits required by
     agreement or custom, and workers compensation insurance;
     .2                        costs of materials, supplies and equipment,
     including cost of transportation, whether incorporated or consumed;
     .3                        rental costs of machinery and equipment,
     exclusive of hand tools, whether rented from the Contractor or others;
     .4                        costs of premiums for all bonds and
     insurance, permit fees, and sales, use or similar taxes related to the
     Work; and
     .5                        additional costs of supervision and field
     office personnel directly attributable to the change.
      
§ 7.3.7 The amount of credit to be allowed by the Contractor to the Owner 
for a deletion or change which results in a net decrease in the Contract 
Sum shall be actual net cost as confirmed by the Architect. When both 
additions and credits covering related Work or substitutions are involved 
in a change, the allowance for overhead and profit shall be figured on the 
basis of net increase, if any, with respect to that change.
 
§ 7.3.8 Pending final determination of the total cost of a Construction 
Change Directive to the Owner, amounts not in dispute for such changes in 
the Work shall be included in Applications for Payment accompanied by a 
Change Order indicating the parties agreement with part or all of such 
costs. For any portion of such cost that remains in dispute, the Architect 
will make an interim determination for purposes of monthly certification 
for payment for those

costs. That determination of cost shall adjust the Contract Sum on the same 
basis as a Change Order, subject to the right of either party to disagree 
and assert a claim in accordance with Article 4.
 
§ 7.3.9 When the Owner and Contractor agree with the determination made by 
the Architect concerning the adjustments in the Contract Sum and Contract 
Time, or otherwise reach agreement upon the adjustments, such agreement 
shall be effective immediately and shall be recorded by preparation and 
execution of an appropriate Change Order.
 
§ 7.4 MINOR CHANGES IN THE WORK
 
§ 7.4.1 The Architect will have authority to order minor changes in the 
Work not involving adjustment in the Contract Sum or extension of the 
Contract Time and not inconsistent with the intent of the Contract 
Documents. Such changes shall be effected by written order and shall be 
binding on the Owner and Contractor. The Contractor shall carry out such 
written orders promptly.
 
ARTICLE 8 TIME
 
§ 8.1 DEFINITIONS
 
§ 8.1.1 Unless otherwise provided, Contract Time is the period of time, 
including authorized adjustments, allotted in the Contract Documents for 
Substantial Completion of the Work.
 
§ 8.1.2 The date of commencement of the Work is the date established in the 
Agreement.
 
§ 8.1.3 The date of Substantial Completion is the date certified by the 
Architect in accordance with Section 9.8.
 
§ 8.1.4 The term day as used in the Contract Documents shall mean 
calendar day unless otherwise specifically defined.
 
§ 8.2 PROGRESS AND COMPLETION
 
§ 8.2.1 Time limits stated in the Contract Documents are of the essence of 
the Contract. By executing the Agreement the Contractor confirms that the 
Contract Time is a reasonable period for performing the Work.
 
§ 8.2.2 The Contractor shall not knowingly, except by agreement or 
instruction of the Owner in writing, prematurely commence operations on the 
site or elsewhere prior to the effective date of insurance required by 
Article II to be furnished by the Contractor and Owner. The date of 
commencement of the Work shall not be changed by the effective date of such 
insurance. Unless the date of commencement is established by the Contract 
Documents or a notice to proceed given by the Owner, the Contractor shall 
notify the Owner in writing not less than five days or other agreed period 
before commencing the Work to permit the timely filing of mortgages, 
mechanics liens and other security interests.
 
§ 8.2.3 The Contractor shall proceed expeditiously with adequate forces and 
shall achieve Substantial Completion within the Contract Time.
 
§ 8.3 DELAYS AND EXTENSIONS OF TIME
 
§ 8.3.1 If the Contractor is delayed at any time in the commencement or 
progress of the Work by an act or neglect of the Owner or Architect, or of 
an employee of either, or of a separate contractor employed by the Owner, 
or by changes ordered in the Work, or by labor disputes, fire, unusual 
delay in deliveries, unavoidable casualties or other causes beyond the 
Contractors control, or by delay authorized by the Owner pending mediation 
and arbitration, or by other causes which the Architect determines may 
justify delay, then the Contract Time shall be extended by Change Order for 
such reasonable time as the Architect may determine.
 
§ 8.3.2 Claims relating to time shall be made in accordance with applicable 
provisions of Section 4.3.
 
§ 8.3.3 This Section 8.3 does not preclude recovery of damages for delay by 
either party under other provisions of the Contract Documents.

ARTICLE 9 PAYMENTS AND COMPLETION
 
§ 9.1 CONTRACT SUM
 
§ 9.1.1 The Contract Sum is stated in the Agreement and, including 
authorized adjustments, is the total amount payable by the Owner to the 
Contractor for performance of the Work under the Contract Documents.
 
§ 9.2 SCHEDULE OF VALUES
 
§ 9.2.1 Before the first Application for Payment, the Contractor shall 
submit to the Architect a schedule of values allocated to various portions 
of the Work, prepared in such form and supported by such data to 
substantiate its accuracy as the Architect may require. This schedule, 
unless objected to by the Architect, shall be used as a basis for reviewing 
the Contractors Applications for Payment.
 
§ 9.3 APPLICATIONS FOR PAYMENT
 
§ 9.3.1 On or before the fifteenth (15th) of each calendar month, the 
Contractor shall submit to the Architect an itemized Application for 
Payment for operations completed in accordance with the schedule of values. 
Such application shall be notarized, if required, and supported by such 
data substantiating the Contractors right to payment as the Owner or 
Architect may require, such as copies of requisitions from Subcontractors 
and material suppliers, and reflecting retainage if provided for in the 
Contract Documents.
 
§ 9.3.1.1 As provided in Section 7.3.8, such applications may include 
requests for payment on account of changes in the Work which have been 
properly authorized by Construction Change Directives, or by interim 
determinations of the Architect, but not yet included in Change Orders.
 
§ 9.3.1.2 Such applications may not include requests for payment for 
portions of the Work for which the Contractor does not intend to pay to a 
Subcontractor or material supplier, unless such Work has been performed by 
others whom the Contractor intends to pay.
 
§ 9.3.2 Unless otherwise provided in the Contract Documents, payments shall 
be made on account of materials and equipment delivered and suitably stored 
at the site for subsequent incorporation in the Work. If approved in 
advance by the Owner, payment may similarly be made for materials and 
equipment suitably stored off the site at a location agreed upon in 
writing. Payment for materials and equipment stored on or off the site 
shall be conditioned upon compliance by the Contractor with procedures 
satisfactory to the Owner to establish the Owners title to such materials 
and equipment or otherwise protect the Owners interest, and shall include 
the costs of applicable insurance, storage and transportation to the site 
for such materials and equipment stored off the site.
 
§ 9.3.3 The Contractor warrants that title to all Work covered by an 
Application for Payment will pass to the Owner no later than the time of 
payment. The Contractor further warrants that upon submittal of an 
Application for Payment all Work for which Certificates for Payment have 
been previously issued and payments received from the Owner shall, to the 
best of the Contractors knowledge, information and belief, be free and 
clear of liens, claims, security interests or encumbrances in favor of the 
Contractor, Subcontractors, material suppliers, or other persons or 
entities making a claim by reason of having provided labor, materials and 
equipment relating to the Work.
 
§ 9.4 CERTIFICATES FOR PAYMENT
 
§ 9.4.1 The Architect will, within seven days after receipt of the 
Contractors Application for Payment, either issue to the Owner a 
Certificate for Payment, with a copy to the Contractor, for such amount as 
the Architect determines is properly due, or notify the Contractor and 
Owner in writing of the Architects reasons for withholding certification 
in whole or in part as provided in Section 9.5.1.
 
§ 9.4.2 The issuance of a Certificate for Payment will constitute a 
representation by the Architect to the Owner, based on the Architects 
evaluation of the Work and the data comprising the Application for Payment, 
that the Work has progressed to the point indicated and that, to the best 
of the Architects knowledge, information and belief, the quality of the 
Work is in accordance with the Contract Documents. The foregoing 
representations are subject to an evaluation of the Work for conformance 
with the Contract Documents upon Substantial Completion, to results of 
subsequent tests and inspections, to correction of minor deviations from 
the Contract Documents prior to completion and to specific qualifications 
expressed by the Architect. The issuance of a Certificate for Payment will 
further constitute a representation that the Contractor is entitled to 
payment in the amount certified. However, the issuance of a Certificate for 
Payment will not be a representation that the Architect has (1) made 
exhaustive or continuous on-site inspections to check the quality or 
quantity of the Work, (2) reviewed construction means, methods, techniques,

Subcontractors and material suppliers and other data requested by the Owner 
to substantiate the Contractors right to payment, or (4) made examination 
to ascertain how or for what purpose the Contractor has used money 
previously paid on account of the Contract Sum.
 
§ 9.5 DECISIONS TO WITHHOLD CERTIFICATION
 
§ 9.5.1 The Architect may withhold a Certificate for Payment in whole or in 
part, to the extent reasonably necessary to protect the Owner, if in the 
Architects opinion the representations to the Owner required by Section 
9.4.2 cannot be made. If the Architect is unable to certify payment in the 
amount of the Application, the Architect will notify the Contractor and 
Owner as provided in Section 9.4.1. If the Contractor and Architect cannot 
agree on a revised amount, the Architect will promptly issue a Certificate 
for Payment for the amount for which the Architect is able to make such 
representations to the Owner. The Architect may also withhold a Certificate 
for Payment or, because of subsequently discovered evidence, may nullify 
the whole or a part of a Certificate for Payment previously issued, to such 
extent as may be necessary in the Architects opinion to protect the Owner 
from loss for which the Contractor is responsible, including loss resulting 
from acts and omissions described in Section 3.3.2, because of:
 
     .1                        defective Work not remedied;
     .2                        third party claims filed or reasonable
     evidence indicating probable filing of such claims unless security
     acceptable to the Owner is provided by the Contractor;
     .3                        failure of the Contractor to make payments
     properly to Subcontractors or for labor, materials or equipment;
     .4                        reasonable evidence that the Work cannot be
     completed for the unpaid balance of the Contract Sum;
     .5                        damage to the Owner or another contractor;
     .6                        reasonable evidence that the Work will not
     be completed within the Contract Time, and that the unpaid balance
     would not be adequate to cover actual or liquidated damages for the
     anticipated delay; or
     .7                        persistent failure to carry out the Work in
     accordance with the Contract Documents.
      
§ 9.5.2 When the above reasons for withholding certification are removed, 
certification will be made for amounts previously withheld.
 
§ 9.6 PROGRESS PAYMENTS
 
§ 9.6.1 After the Architect has issued a Certificate for Payment, the Owner 
shall make payment in the manner and within the time provided in the 
Contract Documents, and shall so notify the Architect.
 
§ 9.6.2 The Contractor shall promptly pay each Subcontractor, upon receipt 
of payment from the Owner, out of the amount paid to the Contractor on 
account of such Subcontractors portion of the Work, the amount to which 
said Subcontractor is entitled, reflecting percentages actually retained 
from payments to the Contractor on account of such Subcontractors portion 
of the Work. The Contractor shall, by appropriate agreement with each 
Subcontractor, require each Subcontractor to make payments to 
Sub-subcontractors in a similar manner.
 
§ 9.6.3 The Architect will, on request, furnish to a Subcontractor, if 
practicable, information regarding percentages of completion or amounts 
applied for by the Contractor and action taken thereon by the Architect and 
Owner on account of portions of the Work done by such Subcontractor.
 
§ 9.6.4 Neither the Owner nor Architect shall have an obligation to pay or 
to see to the payment of money to a Subcontractor except as may otherwise 
be required by law.
 
§ 9.6.5 Payment to material suppliers shall be treated in a manner similar 
to that provided in Sections 9.6.2, 9.6.3 and 9.6.4.
 
§ 9.6.6 A Certificate for Payment, a progress payment, or partial or entire 
use or occupancy of the Project by the Owner shall not constitute 
acceptance of Work not in accordance with the Contract Documents.
 
§ 9.6.7 Unless the Contractor provides the Owner with a payment bond in the 
full penal sum of the Contract Sum, payments received by the Contractor for 
Work properly performed by Subcontractors and suppliers shall be held by 
the Contractor for those Subcontractors or suppliers who performed Work or 
furnished materials, or both, under contract with the Contractor for which 
payment was made by the Owner. Nothing contained herein shall require money 
to be placed in a separate account and not commingled with money of the 
Contractor, shall create any

breach of trust or shall entitle any person or entity to an award of 
punitive damages against the Contractor for breach of the requirements of 
this provision.
 
§ 9.7 FAILURE OF PAYMENT
 
§ 9.7.1 If the Architect does not issue a Certificate for Payment, or if 
the Owner does not pay the Contractor the amount set forth in such 
certificate of payment, each in accordance with Article 12 in the 
Agreement, then the Contractor may, upon fifteen (15) additional days 
written notice o the Owner and Architect, stop the work until payment of 
the amount owing has been received. The Contract Time shall be extended 
appropriately and the Contract Sum shall be increased by the amount of the 
Contractors reasonable costs of shut-down, delay and startup, plus 
interest as provided for in the Contract Documents commencing after the 
expiration of the fifteen (15) day period.
 
§ 9.8 SUBSTANTIAL COMPLETION
 
§ 9.8.1 Substantial Completion is the stage in the progress of the Work 
when the Work or designated portion thereof is sufficiently complete in 
accordance with the Contract Documents so that the Owner can occupy or 
utilize the Work for its intended use.
 
§ 9.8.2 When the Contractor considers that the Work, or a portion thereof 
which the Owner agrees to accept separately, is substantially complete, the 
Contractor shall prepare and submit to the Architect a comprehensive list 
of items to be completed or corrected prior to final payment. Failure to 
include an item on such list does not alter the responsibility of the 
Contractor to complete all Work in accordance with the Contract Documents.
 
§ 9.8.3 Upon receipt of the Contractors list, the Architect and the 
Owners Construction Manager, will make an inspection to determine whether 
the Work or designated portion thereof is substantially complete. If the 
Architects inspection discloses any item, whether or not included on the 
Contractors list, which is not sufficiently complete in accordance with 
the Contract Documents so that the Owner can occupy or utilize the Work or 
designated portion thereof for its intended use, the Contractor shall, 
before issuance of the Certificate of Substantial Completion, complete or 
correct such item upon notification by the Architect. In such case, the 
Contractor shall then submit a request for another inspection by the 
Architect and the Owners Construction Manager to determine Substantial 
Completion.
 
§ 9.8.4 When the Work or designated portion thereof is substantially 
complete, the Architect will prepare a Certificate of Substantial 
Completion which shall establish the date of Substantial Completion, shall 
establish responsibilities of the Owner and Contractor for security, 
maintenance, heat, utilities, damage to the Work and insurance, and shall 
fix the time within which the Contractor shall finish all items on the list 
accompanying the Certificate. Warranties required by the Contract Documents 
shall commence on the date of Substantial Completion of the Work or 
designated portion thereof unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of 
Substantial Completion.
 
§ 9.8.5 The Certificate of Substantial Completion shall be submitted to the 
Owner and Contractor for their written acceptance of responsibilities 
assigned to them in such Certificate. Upon such acceptance and consent of 
surety, if any, the Owner shall make payment of retainage applying to such 
Work or designated portion thereof. Such payment shall be adjusted for Work 
that is incomplete or not in accordance with the requirements of the 
Contract Documents.
 
§ 9.9 PARTIAL OCCUPANCY OR USE
 
§ 9.9.1 The Owner may occupy or use any completed or partially completed 
portion of the Work at any stage when such portion is designated by 
separate agreement with the Contractor, provided such occupancy or use is 
consented to by the insurer as required under Section 11.4.1.5 and 
authorized by public authorities having jurisdiction over the Work. Such 
partial occupancy or use may commence whether or not the portion is 
substantially complete, provided the Owner and Contractor have accepted in 
writing the responsibilities assigned to each of them for payments, 
retainage, if any, security, maintenance, heat, utilities, damage to the 
Work and insurance, and have agreed in writing concerning the period for 
correction of the Work and commencement of warranties required by the 
Contract Documents. When the Contractor considers a portion substantially 
complete, the Contractor shall prepare and submit a list to the Architect 
as provided under Section 9.8.2. Consent of the Contractor to partial 
occupancy or use shall not be unreasonably withheld. The stage of the 
progress of the Work shall be determined by written agreement between the 
Owner and Contractor or, if no agreement is reached, by decision of the 
Architect.

§ 9.9.2 Immediately prior to such partial occupancy or use, the Owner, 
Contractor and Architect shall jointly inspect the area to be occupied or 
portion of the Work to be used in order to determine and record the 
condition of the Work.
 
§ 9.9.3 Unless otherwise agreed upon, partial occupancy or use of a portion 
or portions of the Work shall not constitute acceptance of Work not 
complying with the requirements of the Contract Documents.
 
§ 9.10 FINAL COMPLETION AND FINAL PAYMENT
 
§ 9.10.1 Upon receipt of written notice that the Work is ready for final 
inspection and acceptance and upon receipt of a final Application for 
Payment, the Architect will promptly make such inspection and, when the 
Architect finds the Work acceptable under the Contract Documents and the 
Contract fully performed, the Architect will promptly issue a final 
Certificate for Payment stating that to the best of the Architects 
knowledge, information and belief, and on the basis of the Architects 
on-site visits and inspections, the Work has been completed in accordance 
with terms and conditions of the Contract Documents and that the entire 
balance found to be due the Contractor and noted in the final Certificate 
is due and payable. The Architects final Certificate for Payment will 
constitute a further representation that conditions listed in Section 
9.10.2 as precedent to the Contractors being entitled to final payment 
have been fulfilled.
 
§ 9.10.2 Neither final payment nor any remaining retained percentage shall 
become due until the Contractor submits to the Architect (1) an affidavit 
that payrolls, bills for materials and equipment, and other indebtedness 
connected with the Work for which the Owner or the Owners property might 
be responsible or encumbered (less amounts withheld by Owner) have been 
paid or otherwise satisfied, (2) a certificate evidencing that insurance 
required by the Contract Documents to remain in force after final payment 
is currently in effect and will not be canceled or allowed to expire until 
at least 30 days prior written notice has been given to the Owner, (3) a 
written statement that the Contractor knows of no substantial reason that 
the insurance will not be renewable to cover the period required by the 
Contract Documents, (4) consent of surety, if any, to final payment and 
(5), if required by the Owner, other data establishing payment or 
satisfaction of obligations, such as receipts, releases and waivers of 
liens, claims, security interests or encumbrances arising out of the 
Contract, to the extent and in such form as may be designated by the Owner. 
If a Subcontractor refuses to furnish a release or waiver required by the 
Owner, the Contractor may furnish a bond satisfactory to the Owner to 
indemnify the Owner against such lien. If such lien remains unsatisfied 
after payments are made, the Contractor shall refund to the Owner all money 
that the Owner may be compelled to pay in discharging such lien, including 
all costs and reasonable attorneys fees.
 
§ 9.10.3 If, after Substantial Completion of the Work, final completion 
thereof is materially delayed through no fault of the Contractor or by 
issuance of Change Orders affecting final completion, and the Architect 
(after review and approval by the Owners Construction Manager) so 
confirms, the Owner shall, upon application by the Contractor and 
certification by the Architect, and without terminating the Contract, make 
payment of the balance due for that portion of the Work fully completed and 
accepted. If the remaining balance for Work not fully completed or 
corrected is less than retainage stipulated in the Contract Documents, and 
if bonds have been furnished, the written consent of surety to payment of 
the balance due for that portion of the Work fully completed and accepted 
shall be submitted by the Contractor to the Architect prior to 
certification of such payment. Such payment shall be made under terms and 
conditions governing final payment, except that it shall not constitute a 
waiver of claims.
 
§ 9.10.4 The making of final payment shall constitute a waiver of Claims by 
the Owner except those arising from:
 
     .1                        liens, Claims, security interests or
     encumbrances arising out of the Contract and unsettled;
     .2                        failure of the Work to comply with the
     requirements of the Contract Documents; or
     .3                        terms of special warranties required by the
     Contract Documents.
      
§ 9.10.5 Acceptance of final payment by the Contractor, a Subcontractor or 
material supplier shall constitute a waiver of claims by that payee except 
those previously made in writing and identified by that payee as unsettled 
at the time of final Application for Payment.

     structures and utilities not designated for removal, relocation or
     replacement in the course of construction.

in whole or in part by the Contractor, a Subcontractor, a 
Sub-subcontractor, or anyone directly or indirectly employed by any of 
them, or by anyone for whose acts they may be liable and for which the 
Contractor is responsible under Sections 10.2.1.2 and 10.2.1.3, except 
damage or loss attributable to acts or omissions of the Owner or Architect 
or anyone directly or indirectly employed by either of them, or by anyone 
for whose acts either of them may be liable, and not attributable to the 
fault or negligence of the Contractor. The foregoing obligations of the 
Contractor are in addition to the Contractors obligations under Section 
3.18.

affected area and report the condition to the Owner and Architect in 
writing.
 
§ 10.3.2 The Owner shall obtain the services of a licensed laboratory to 
verify the presence or absence of the material or substance reported by the 
Contractor and, in the event such material or substance is found to be

consultants and agents and employees of any of them from and against 
claims, damages, losses and expenses, including but not limited to

maintain Project Management Protective Liability insurance from the 
Contractors usual sources as primary coverage for the Owners, 
Contractors and Architects vicarious liability for construction 
operations under the Contract. Unless otherwise required by the Contract 
Documents, the Owner shall reimburse the Contractor by increasing the

insurance coverage, and the Contractor shall not be responsible for 
purchasing any other liability insurance on behalf of the Owner. The 
minimum limits of liability purchased with such coverage shall be equal to

§ 11.3.2 To the extent damages are covered by Project Management Protective 
Liability insurance, the Owner, Contractor and Architect waive all rights 
against each other for damages, except such rights as they may have to the 
proceeds of such insurance. The policy shall provide for such waivers of

§ 11.3.3 The Owner shall not require the Contractor to include the Owner, 
Architect or other persons or entities as additional insureds on the

a builders risk all-risk or equivalent policy form in the amount of the 
initial Contract Sum, plus value of subsequent Contract modifications and 
cost of materials supplied or installed by others, comprising total value 
for the entire Project at the site on a replacement cost basis without 
optional deductibles. Such property insurance shall be maintained, unless 
otherwise provided in the Contract Documents or otherwise agreed in writing 
by all persons and entities who are beneficiaries of such insurance, until 
final payment has been made as provided in Section 9.10 or until no person 
or entity other than the Owner has an insurable interest in the property

Subcontractors and Sub-subcontractors in the Project.

including, without duplication of coverage, theft, vandalism, malicious 
mischief, collapse, earthquake, flood, windstorm, falsework, testing and 
startup, temporary buildings and debris removal including demolition 
occasioned by enforcement of any applicable legal requirements, and shall 
cover reasonable compensation for Architects and Contractors services and 
expenses required as a result of such insured loss.
 
§ 11.4.1.2 If the Owner does not intend to purchase such property insurance 
required by the Contract and with all of the coverages in the amount 
described above, the Owner shall so inform the Contractor in writing prior 
to commencement of the Work. The Contractor may then effect insurance which 
will protect the interests of the Contractor, Subcontractors and 
Sub-subcontractors in the Work, and by appropriate Change Order the cost 
thereof shall be charged to the Owner. If the Contractor is damaged by the 
failure or neglect of the Owner to purchase or maintain insurance as 
described above, without so notifying the Contractor in writing, then the 
Owner shall bear all reasonable costs properly attributable thereto.
 
§ 11.4.1.3 If the property insurance requires deductibles, the Owner shall 
pay costs not covered because of such deductibles.
 
§ 11.4.1.4 This property insurance shall cover portions of the Work stored 
off the site, and also portions of the Work in transit.

§ 11.4.1.5 Partial occupancy or use in accordance with Section 9.9 shall 
not commence until the insurance company or companies providing property 
insurance have consented to such partial occupancy or use by endorsement or 
otherwise. The Owner and the Contractor shall take reasonable steps to 
obtain consent of the insurance company or companies and shall, without 
mutual written consent, take no action with respect to partial occupancy or 
use that would cause cancellation, lapse or reduction of insurance.
 
§ 11.4.2 Boiler and Machinery Insurance. The Owner shall purchase and 
maintain boiler and machinery insurance required by the Contract Documents 
or by law, which shall specifically cover such insured objects during 
installation and until final acceptance by the Owner; this insurance shall 
include interests of the Owner, Contractor, Subcontractors and

§ 11.4.3 Loss of Use Insurance. The Owner, at the Owners option, may 
purchase and maintain such insurance as will insure the Owner against loss 
of use of the Owners property due to fire or other hazards, however 
caused. The Owner waives all rights of action against the Contractor for 
loss of use of the Owners property, including consequential losses due to 
fire or other hazards however caused.
 
§ 11.4.4 If the Contractor requests in writing that insurance for risks 
other than those described herein or other special causes of loss be 
included in the property insurance policy, the Owner shall, if possible, 
include such insurance, and the cost thereof shall be charged to the 
Contractor by appropriate Change Order.
 
§ 11.4.5 If during the Project construction period the Owner insures 
properties, real or personal or both, at or adjacent to the site by 
property insurance under policies separate from those insuring the Project, 
or if after final payment property insurance is to be provided on the 
completed Project through a policy or policies other than those insuring 
the Project during the construction period, the Owner shall waive all 
rights in accordance with the terms of Section 11.4.7 for damages caused by 
fire or other causes of loss covered by this separate property insurance. 
All separate policies shall provide this waiver of subrogation by 
endorsement or otherwise.
 
§ 11.4.6 Before an exposure to loss may occur, the Owner shall file with 
the Contractor a copy of each policy that includes insurance coverages 
required by this Section 11.4. Each policy shall contain all generally 
applicable conditions, definitions, exclusions and endorsements related to 
this Project. Each policy shall contain a provision that the policy will 
not be canceled or allowed to expire, and that its limits will not be 
reduced, until at least 30 days prior written notice has been given to the 
Contractor.
 
§ 11.4.7 Waivers of Subrogation. The Owner and Contractor waive all rights 
against (1) each other and any of their subcontractors, sub-subcontractors, 
agents and employees, each of the other, and (2) the Architect, Architects 
consultants, separate contractors described in Article 6, if any, and any 
of their subcontractors, sub-subcontractors, agents and employees, for 
damages caused by fire or other causes of loss to the extent covered by 
property insurance obtained pursuant to this Section 11.4 or other property 
insurance applicable to the Work, except such rights as they have to 
proceeds of such insurance held by the Owner as fiduciary. The Owner or 
Contractor, as appropriate, shall require of the Architect, Architects 
consultants, separate contractors described in Article 6, if any, and the 
subcontractors, sub-subcontractors, agents and employees of any of them, by 
appropriate agreements, written where legally required for validity, 
similar waivers each in favor of other parties enumerated herein. The 
policies shall provide such waivers of subrogation by endorsement or 
otherwise. A waiver of subrogation shall be effective as to a person or 
entity even though that person or entity would otherwise have a duty of 
indemnification, contractual or otherwise, did not pay the insurance 
premium directly or indirectly, and whether or not the person or entity had 
an insurable interest in the property damaged.
 
§ 11.4.8 A loss insured under Owners property insurance shall be adjusted 
by the Owner as fiduciary and made payable to the Owner as fiduciary for 
the insureds, as their interests may appear, subject to requirements of any 
applicable mortgagee clause and of Section 11.4.10. The Contractor shall 
pay Subcontractors their just shares of insurance proceeds received by the 
Contractor, and by appropriate agreements, written where legally required 
for validity, shall require Subcontractors to make payments to their 
Sub-subcontractors in similar manner.
 
§ 11.4.9 If required in writing by a party in interest, the Owner as 
fiduciary shall, upon occurrence of an insured loss, give bond for proper 
performance of the Owners duties. The cost of required bonds shall be 
charged against proceeds received as fiduciary. The Owner shall deposit in 
a separate account proceeds so received, which the Owner shall distribute 
in accordance with such agreement as the parties in interest may reach, or 
in accordance with

an arbitration award in which case the procedure shall be as provided in 
Section 4.6. If after such loss no other special agreement is made and 
unless the Owner terminates the Contract for convenience, replacement of 
damaged property shall be performed by the Contractor after notification of 
a Change in the Work in accordance with Article 7.
 
§ 11.4.10 The Owner as fiduciary shall have power to adjust and settle a 
loss with insurers unless one of the parties in interest shall object in 
writing within five days after occurrence of loss to the Owners exercise 
of this power; if such objection is made, the dispute shall be resolved as 
provided in Sections 4.5 and 4.6. The Owner as fiduciary shall, in the case 
of arbitration, make settlement with insurers in accordance with directions 
of the arbitrators. If distribution of insurance proceeds by arbitration is 
required, the arbitrators will direct such distribution.
 
§ 11.5 PERFORMANCE BOND AND PAYMENT BOND
 
§ 11.5.1 The Owner shall have the right to require the Contractor to 
furnish bonds covering faithful performance of the Contract and payment of 
obligations arising thereunder as stipulated in bidding requirements or 
specifically required in the Contract Documents on the date of execution of 
the Contract.
 
§ 11.5.2 Upon the request of any person or entity appearing to be a 
potential beneficiary of bonds covering payment of obligations arising

ARTICLE 12 UNCOVERING AND CORRECTION OF WORK
 
§ 12.1 UNCOVERING OF WORK
 
§ 12.1.1 If a portion of the Work is covered contrary to the Architects 
request or to requirements specifically expressed in the Contract 
Documents, it must, if required in writing by the Architect, be uncovered 
for the Architects examination and be replaced at the Contractors expense 
without change in the Contract Time.
 
§ 12.1.2 If a portion of the Work has been covered which the Architect has 
not specifically requested to examine prior to its being covered, the 
Architect may request to see such Work and it shall be uncovered by the 
Contractor. If such Work is in accordance with the Contract Documents, 
costs of uncovering and replacement shall, by appropriate Change Order, be 
at the Owners expense. If such Work is not in accordance with the Contract 
Documents, correction shall be at the Contractors expense unless the 
condition was caused by the Owner or a separate contractor in which event 
the Owner shall be responsibte for payment of such costs.
 
§ 12.2 CORRECTION OF WORK
 
§ 12.2.1 BEFORE OR AFTER SUBSTANTIAL COMPLETION
 
§ 12.2.1.1 The Contractor shall promptly correct Work rejected by the 
Architect or failing to conform to the requirements of the Contract 
Documents, whether discovered before or after Substantial Completion and 
whether or not fabricated, installed or completed. Costs of correcting such 
rejected Work, including additional testing and inspections and 
compensation for the Architects services and expenses made necessary 
thereby, shall be at the Contractors expense.
 
§ 12.2.2 AFTER SUBSTANTIAL COMPLETION
 
§ 12.2.2.1 In addition to the Contractors obligations under Section 3.5, 
if, within one year after the date of Substantial Completion of the Work or 
designated portion thereof or after the date for commencement of warranties 
established under Section 9.9.1, or by terms of an applicable special 
warranty required by the Contract Documents, any of the Work is found to be 
not in accordance with the requirements of the Contract Documents, the 
Contractor shall correct it promptly after receipt of written notice from 
the Owner to do so unless the Owner has previously given the Contractor a 
written acceptance of such condition. The Owner shall give such notice 
promptly after discovery of the condition. During the one-year period for 
correction of Work, if the Owner fails to notify the Contractor and give 
the Contractor an opportunity to make the correction, the Owner waives the 
rights to require correction by the Contractor and to make a claim for 
breach of warranty. If the Contractor fails to correct nonconforming Work 
within a reasonable time within ten (10) days after receipt of notice from 
the Owner or Architect, and/or fails to prosecute diligently such 
corrective work to completion the Owner may correct it in accordance with 
Section 2.4.

with respect to portions of Work first performed after Substantial 
Completion by the period of time between Substantial Completion and the 
actual performance of the Work.
 
§ 12.2.2.3 The one-year period for correction of Work shall not be extended 
by corrective Work performed by the Contractor pursuant to this Section 
12.2.

which are not in accordance with the requirements of the Contract Documents 
and are neither corrected by the Contractor nor accepted by the Owner.

damaged construction, whether completed or partially completed, of the 
Owner or separate contractors caused by the Contractors correction or

Contract Documents.
 
§ 12.2.5 Nothing contained in this Section 12.2 shall be construed to 
establish a period of limitation with respect to other obligations which 
the Contractor might have under the Contract Documents. Establishment of 
the one-year period for correction of Work as described in Section 12.2.2 
relates only to the specific obligation of the Contractor to correct the 
Work, and has no relationship to the time within which the obligation to 
comply with the Contract Documents may be sought to be enforced, nor to the 
time within which proceedings may be commenced to establish the 
Contractors liability with respect to the Contractors obligations other 
than specifically to correct the Work.
 
§ 12.3 ACCEPTANCE OF NONCONFORMING WORK
 
§ 12.3.1 If the Owner prefers to accept Work which is not in accordance 
with the requirements of the Contract Documents, the Owner may do so 
instead of requiring its removal and correction, in which case the Contract 
Sum will be reduced as appropriate and equitable. Such adjustment shall be 
effected whether or not final payment has been made.

arrangements for such additional testing, inspection or approval by an 
entity acceptable to the Owner, and the Contractor shall give timely notice 
to the Architect of when and where tests and inspections are to be made so 
that the Architect may be present for such procedures. Such costs, except 
as provided in Section 13.5.3, shall be at the Owners expense.
 
§ 13.5.3 If such procedures for testing, inspection or approval under 
Sections 13.5.1 and 13.5.2 reveal failure of the portions of the Work to

made necessary by such failure including those of repeated procedures and 
compensation for the Architects services and expenses shall be at the

ARTICLE 14 TERMINATION OR SUSPENSION OF THE CONTRACT
 
§ 14.1 TERMINATION BY THE CONTRACTOR
 
§ 14.1.1 The Contractor may terminate the Contract if the Work is stopped 
for a period of 30 consecutive days through no act or fault of the 
Contractor or a Subcontractor, Sub-subcontractor or their agents or 
employees or any other persons or entities performing portions of the Work 
under direct or indirect contract with the Contractor, for any of the 
following reasons:
 
      .1                         issuance of an order of a court or other
      public authority having jurisdiction which requires all Work to be
      stopped;
      .2                         an act of government, such as a
      declaration of national emergency which requires all Work to be
      stopped;
      .3                         because the Architect has not issued a
      Certificate for Payment and has not notified the Contractor of the
      reason for withholding certification as provided in Section 9.4.1, or
      because the Owner has not made payment on a Certificate for Payment
      within the time stated in the Contract Documents; or
      .4                         the Owner has failed to furnish to the
      Contractor promptly, upon the Contractors request, reasonable
      evidence as required by Section 2.2.1.
      
§ 14.1.2 The Contractor may terminate the Contract if, through no act or 
fault of the Contractor or a Subcontractor, Sub-subcontractor or their 
agents or employees or any other persons or entities performing portions of 
the Work under direct or indirect contract with the Contractor, repeated 
suspensions, delays or interruptions of the entire Work by the Owner as 
described in Section 14.3 constitute in the aggregate more than 100 percent 
of the total number of days scheduled for completion, or 120 days in any 
365-day period, whichever is less.
 
§ 14.1.3 If one of the reasons described in Section 14.1.1 or 14.1.2 
exists, the Contractor may, upon seven days written notice to the Owner 
and Architect, terminate the Contract and recover from the Owner payment 
for Work executed and for proven loss with respect to materials, equipment, 
tools, and construction equipment and machinery, including reasonable 
overhead, profit and damages.
 
§ 14.1.4 If the Work is stopped for a period of 60 consecutive days through 
no act or fault of the Contractor or a Subcontractor or their agents or 
employees or any other persons performing portions of the Work under 
contract with the Contractor because the Owner has persistently failed to 
fulfill the Owners obligations under the Contract Documents with respect 
to matters important to the progress of the Work, the Contractor may, upon 
seven additional days written notice to the Owner and the Architect, 
terminate the Contract and recover from the Owner as provided in Section 
14.1.3.
 
§ 14.2 TERMINATION BY THE OWNER FOR CAUSE
 
§ 14.2.1 The Owner may terminate the Contract if the Contractor:
 
      .1                         persistently or repeatedly refuses or
      fails to supply enough properly skilled workers or proper materials;
      .2                         fails to make payment to Subcontractors
      for materials or labor in accordance with (i) the respective
      agreements between the Contractor and the Subcontractors and (ii)
      this agreement;
      .3                         persistently disregards laws, ordinances,
      or rules, regulations or orders of a public authority having
      jurisdiction; or
      .4                         otherwise is guilty of substantial breach
      of a provision of the Contract Documents.
      
§ 14.2.2 When any of the above reasons exist, the Owner, upon certification 
by the Architect that sufficient cause exists to justify such action, may 
without prejudice to any other rights or remedies of the Owner and after 
giving the Contractor and the Contractors surety, if any, seven days 
written notice, terminate employment of the Contractor and may, subject to 
any prior rights of the surety:
 
      .1                         take possession of the site and of all
      materials, equipment, tools, and construction equipment and machinery
      thereon owned by the Contractor;
      .2                         accept assignment of subcontracts pursuant
      to Section 5.4; and
      .3                         finish the Work by whatever reasonable
      method the Owner may deem expedient. Upon request of the Contractor,
      the Owner shall furnish to the Contractor a detailed accounting of
      the costs incurred by the Owner in finishing the Work.
      
§ 14.2.3 When the Owner terminates the Contract for one of the reasons 
stated in Section 14.2.1, the Contractor shall not be entitled to receive 
further payment until the Work is finished.

     so suspended, delayed or interrupted by another cause for which the
     Contractor is responsible; or
     .2                        that an equitable adjustment is made or
     denied under another provision of the Contract.

   shall purchase and maintain such insurance as will protect itself and
   the Owner from claims set forth below, which may arise out of, or result
   from its operations under the Contract or its operations in connection

   C.                        The Contractor shall add the Owner and any of
   its affiliated entities, as Additional Insureds on all policies required
   above, except Workers Compensation which requires a Waiver of
   Subrogation. The Contractor shall be solely responsible for paying the
   cost of such insurance premiums. If requested by Owner, any Lender or
   other interested party, provided such insurable interest is shown to the
   insurer, shall also be included as an additional insured.
    
   D.                       The insurance required by this Exhibit H
   shall include Contractual Liability Insurance, applicable to the
   Contractors obligations hereunder.
    
   E.                         Prior to the commencement of any Work under
   this Agreement, the Contractor, at its sole cost and expense, shall
   furnish the Owner with certificates of insurance providing the Owner
   with evidence of the insurance coverages enumerated herein, pursuant to
   policies which shall be kept in full force and effect throughout the
   period specified with respect to each such policy. All insurance
   coverage required of the Contractor shall provide primary coverage and
   be non-contributory with any insurance maintained by the Owner.
    
   F.                         The Contractor shall make the original
   policies themselves available for inspection by authorized
   representatives of the Owner, Lender, and their agents, representatives,
   consultants and contractors at all reasonable times. The certificates
   required under this Subparagraph shall contain a provision that coverage
   afforded under the policies will not be canceled, altered, or amended,
   or not renewed until at least thirty (30) days prior written notice has
   been given to the Owner. This thirty (30) day notice requirement must
   also appear by endorsement to all
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
   Contractors and Subcontractors policies. The Contractor may also be
   required to submit copies of its complete insurance policies, certified
   if requested, evidencing coverages required by this Agreement within
   thirty (30) days from the date of this Agreement. This is in addition to
   the requirement that the Contractor supply certificates of insurance.
   Insurance coverages must be provided by insurance companies acceptable
   to the Owner.
    
   G.                        The following Conditions are to be noted:
    
     1.                         The Contractor shall require, or provide on
     behalf of its subcontractors and sub-subcontractors, insurance similar
     as to type of coverage to that required of the Contractor by the Owner
     but with lower limits as the Contractor deems appropriate. Failure of
     the Contractor to obtain evidence of coverage from its subcontractors
     and sub-subcontractors, consistent with that which is required, shall
     not relieve the Contractor of any of its responsibilities under this
     Exhibit H.
      
     2.                         The Owner makes no representations or
     warranties with respect to the extent or adequacy of the insurance
     protection required to be provided by the Contractor, and the
     Contractor and his Subcontractors shall satisfy themselves as to the
     coverage afforded by such policies. The furnishings of the insurance
     policies by the Contractor shall not limit, reduce or otherwise amend
     any of the obligations or liabilities of the Contractor expressed
     herein and elsewhere in the Contract Documents.
      
     3.                         In the event of any failure by the
     Contractor to comply with any of the provisions of this Exhibit H,
     the Owner may, at its option and without any obligation to do so, upon
     written notice to the Contractor, exercise all of its rights and
     remedies in the event of a default by the Contractor hereunder,
     including without limitation terminating this Agreement or suspending
     it until there is full compliance by the Contractor with this Exhibit
     H.
      
H. BUILDERS RISK/COURSE OF CONSTRUCTION INSURANCE
 
     1.                         The Owner will purchase and maintain
     Builders Risk Insurance to one hundred percent (100%) of the
     insurable value thereof. The policy will provide the standard coverage
     of Fire and Extended Coverage perils for physical loss or damage to
     the Project or materials delivered to the Site for installation into
     the structure. Theft coverage is not included nor is coverage for
     Contractors tools or equipment. The Contractors and subcontractors
     shall be an insured on the Policy, as their Interest may appear, and
     only to that extent. Contractor, subcontractors and/or
     sub-subcontractors shall be responsible for their proportionate share
     of any deductible amount assessed on any covered property loss. The
     deductible on the policy shall not exceed the sum of Five Thousand
     Dollars ($5,000.00) per loss. The full loss, if any, will be adjusted
     with, and made payable to the Owner, as trustee for all insureds, as
     their interest may appear, subject to any rights of any Lender
     involved with the Project.
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
     2.                         If required in writing by any party in
     interest, the Owner as trustee shall upon the occurrence of any
     Builders Risk insured loss, give bond for the proper performance of
     its duties, it shall deposit in a separate account any money so
     received, and it shall distribute it in accordance with such agreement
     as the parties in interest may reach. If after such loss no other
     special agreement is made, replacement of damaged work shall be
     covered by an appropriate change order. The party in interest that
     requires the Owner as trustee to give bond for the proper performance
     of its duties shall pay for such bond and associated costs.
      
     3.                         Any Contractor and/or subcontractor or
     supplier who supplies materials for the Work shall be solely
     responsible for and pay for insuring the materials while stored off
     the Site and while the materials are in transit to the Site, until
     located at the Site. If material and equipment is to be paid for prior
     to being located at the Site, the Contractor and/or all subcontractors
     shall purchase and maintain insurance coverage on the materials in a
     format protecting the property regardless of its location for the All
     Risks or Risk of Physical Loss type perils which are to include
     Theft, Vandalism & Malicious Mischief. Any deductible clause chosen
     shall be the sole responsibility of the Contractor and/or
     subcontractor or supplier and be subject to the written approval of
     the Owner. This insurance shall be in a format acceptable to the
     Owner, and shall insure for the Replacement Cost of the materials,
     with no coinsurance applicable. The Owner shall be the Loss Payee on
     the policy, if so requested. Evidence of coverage acceptable to the
     Owner shall be provided by the Contractor or subcontractor prior to
     payment being made by the Owner for the materials.
      
     4.                         Each Contractor and subcontractor(s) is/are
     solely responsible for any and all equipment, tools, materials, and
     the like, which is/are used in performing the Work whether owned,
     leased, rented, borrowed or otherwise at all times and under all
     conditions.
      
     5.                         If the Owner finds it necessary to occupy
     or use a portion or portions of the Work prior to substantial
     completion, Owner shall provide proof of insurance for Owners
     operations acceptable to Contractor and such occupancy shall not be
     opposed by the Contractor or any subcontractors and
     sub-subcontractors.
      
     6.                         Unless otherwise provided, the Builders
     Risk insurance provided by the Owner shall remain in effect, without
     conditional restrictions, until final acceptance of the Contractors
     work by the Owner, or until the Owner has placed the permanent
     insurance on the Work.
      
   I.                            OWNERS RIGHT TO OBTAIN INSURANCE
    
   The Owner shall have the option, but not the obligation, to obtain and
   maintain any additional
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
   insurance in the types, coverages and/or amounts as they deem
   appropriate, at their own cost and expense. However, Contractors
   insurance as required by this Exhibit H shall at all times be primary
   and non-contributory to any coverage(s) purchased or maintained by the
   Owner.
    
   J.                           NO COVERAGE CHANGE
    
   Any and all insurance policies required herein to be obtained by the
   Contractor shall provide that there shall be no modification,
   termination, expiration or non-renewal of such policies of insurance
   without at least thirty (30) days prior written notice to the Owner.
    
   K.                       WAIVER OF SUBROGATION
    
   The Contractor hereby releases and waives any and all rights of
   subrogation against the Owner which, in the absence of this Exhibit H,
   would arise in favor of any insurance company insuring the Contractor
   against loss by fire, extended coverage, casualty and loss of any other
   type resulting from damage to or destruction of property and the Work or
   any portion thereof or damage to or destruction of the property of the
   Contractor located on the Site, and the Contractor hereby releases and
   waives its right of recovery against the Owner for loss or damage to or
   destruction of the property the Work or any portion thereof, or in
   damage to or destruction of the property of the Contractor located on
   the Site, caused by fire or other hazards insured against by extended
   coverage or casualty insurance. The Contractor shall require of each
   subcontractor, agreements written where legally required for validity,
   providing for similar waivers, each against each other.
    
   L.                         INDEMNIFICATION
    
     1.                         To the fullest extent permitted by law, the
     Contractor shall protect, indemnify, hold harmless and defend the
     Owner, and its directors and employees, from and against all claims,
     damages, losses, and expenses, including, but not limited to
     attorneys fees, arising out of or which are alleged to arise out of
     or be connected with or resulting from the Work, including, without
     limiting the generality of the foregoing, all claims for Contractors
     breach of this Agreement, any claims brought by any party out of
     actions arising by, through, or under the Contractor, its
     subcontractors, agents and employees, any claims, damages, loss, or
     expense, which are attributable to bodily injury, sickness, disease or
     death, or for injury to, or destruction of tangible property, (other
     than to the Work), whether based or claimed to be based upon
     statutory, contractual, tort or other liability but only to the extent
     caused by the Contractor or those under the Contractor regardless of
     whether or not it is caused in part by a party indemnified there
     under, save and except those claims directly attributable to the sole
     and willful misconduct of the Owner. Such obligations shall not be
     construed to negate, abridge, or otherwise reduce any right or
     obligation or indemnity, which could otherwise exist as to any party
     or person described in this Section L - Exhibit H If any part of
     this provision is
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
     adjudged to be contrary to law, the remaining parts of this provision
     shall in all other respects be and remain legally effective and
     binding. Moreover, this provision shall not be construed to eliminate
     or in any way reduce any other indemnification or right which the
     Owner has by law.
      
     2.                         The parties acknowledge that the Contractor
     shall control all construction means and methods and all safety
     procedures and compliance with OSHA and/or any other laws and
     ordinances. The Contractors indemnity shall cover any matters arising
     as a result of construction means or methods or safety procedures
     since the Owner shall have no involvement with or responsibility
     therefore, except for Work performed by Owner or Owners Contractors.
     This indemnity shall survive the termination of the Agreement with
     respect to matters occurring on or before the date of such
     termination.
      
     3.                         In any and all claims against the Owner,
     and/or any of its employees, by any employee of the Contractor,
     subcontractor, or sub-subcontractor, anyone directly or indirectly
     employed by any of them, or anyone for whose acts any of them may be
     liable, the indemnification obligation under this Section L -
     Exhibit H shall not be limited in any way by any limitation or the
     amount or type damage, compensation or benefits payable by, or for the
     Contractor, subcontractor, or any sub-subcontractor, under Workers
     Compensation Acts, Disability Benefits Acts, or other Employee Benefit
     Acts.
      
     4.                         The obligations of the Contractor under
     this Section L - Exhibit H shall not extend to the liability of
     the Architect, his agents or employees, arising out of (1) the
     preparation or approval of Maps, Drawings, Opinion, Reports, Surveys,
     Change Order, Designs, or Specifications or (2) the giving of or
     failure to give directions or instruction by the Architect, his agents
     or employees, provided such giving, or failure to give, is the primary
     cause of the injury or damage.
      
   M.                    RIGHTS OF LIEN
    
     1.                         The Contractor hereby agrees that all of
     its rights of lien, whether conferred by statute or otherwise, with
     respect to all or any portion of the Work are subordinate to the lien
     of any mortgage and to the rights of any beneficiary under a deed of
     trust (and all advances secured thereby), now or hereafter encumbering
     all or any portion of the Work, given by the Owner to the Lender to
     secure construction or permanent financing for the Work, and the
     Contractor shall execute such documents effectuating such
     subordination as the Owner may require. The Contractor also agrees to
     obtain, for the benefit of Lender, similar subordination agreements,
     in form and substance satisfactory to the Owner and Lender, from all
     Subcontractors, Sub-subcontractors, material and equipment suppliers
     and other persons supplying labor and materials in connection with the
     Work.
    
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
     2                            The Contractor is obligated to notify the
     Owner immediately if he becomes aware of the existence of any lien
     upon the Site or Work which is the result of Contractors Work
     (including Work performed by Contractor, subcontractors, and
     sub-subcontractors). Provided Contractor has been paid currently per
     the Contract Documents, Contractor shall remove such lien within ten
     (10) days of the attachment thereof (unless the Owner otherwise
     consents in writing).
      
     3                            The Contractor further agrees to
     indemnify and hold harmless the Owner for, from and against any claim
     of lien, or liens, or both, for labor or service performed or
     materials supplied, or both, furnished or to be used on the Site.
      
 N. BONDING:
    
   If requested, the Contractor shall furnish Bonds in the form required by
   the Owner, covering the faithful performance of the Contract, and the
   payment of all obligations arising there under. These may be in the form
   of a 100% Performance, 100% Labor and Material Payment.
    
 O. MISCELLANOUS:
 
   In the event of a conflict between the term and conditions of AIA
   Document A111 -1997 Standard Form of Agreement between Owner and
   Contractor and/or AIA Document A201 -1997 General Conditions of the
   Contract for Construction and the terms and conditions of this Exhibit,
   the terms and the conditions of this Exhibit shall control.
