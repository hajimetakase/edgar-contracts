opportunity to be present for any tests of any Equipment or Owner 
Equipment.


5.5 Examination of Work before Covering. No part of the Equipment or Owner 
Equipment, as applicable, shall be permanently covered up at the Site or 
put out of view without affording Owner a reasonable opportunity to examine 
and measure any such part of the Equipment or Owner Equipment, as 
applicable, which is about to be covered up or put out of view, including 
examining foundations before any part of the Equipment or Owner Equipment, 
as applicable, is placed thereon. For certain agreed parts of the Work as 
set forth in Exhibit A, Contractor shall give notice to Owner whenever any 
such part of the Equipment or Owner Equipment, as applicable, or 
foundations is or are ready or about to be ready for examination and Owner 
shall, without unreasonable delay, attend (or inform Contractor that it is 
unnecessary for it to attend) for the purpose of examining and measuring 
such part of the Equipment or Owner Equipment, as applicable, or of 
examining such foundations.


5.6 Uncovering and Making Openings. If, following discovery of defective 
workmanship or materials in any part of the Work, Owner has reasonable 
grounds to suspect that further parts of the Work may be similarly 
defective, Contractor shall, upon the reasonable request of Owner, provide 
Owner clear evidence that such other parts are not defective to the 
reasonable satisfaction of Owner or shall uncover such further parts of the 
Work or make further openings, in or through the same, and Contractor shall 
inspect and repair, if necessary, any such parts. The costs of such work 
carried out by Contractor under this Section shall be borne by Contractor, 
unless the parts of the Work so uncovered turn out to be not defective in 
which case Owner shall bear all such costs.

6.1 ***
 
32

------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.2 Commencement of Work for Unit 6 and the Unit 5 Scrubber. For Unit 6 and 
Unit 5 Scrubber, Contractor shall commence the performance of the Services 
with respect thereto upon the receipt of the Limited Notice to Proceed with 
respect to Unit 6 and Unit 5 Scrubber, or, if none is given, upon the Full 
Notice to Proceed with respect to Unit 6 and Unit 5 Scrubber, and 
continuously and diligently fulfill its obligations under this Agreement 
through the Warranty Period. For Unit 6 and the Unit 5 Scrubber, Contractor 
shall perform its obligations under this Agreement in accordance with the 
Contract Price for Unit 6 and the Unit 5 Scrubber as set forth on Exhibit I 
and with the Key Schedule Milestones set forth in Exhibit C, as such may be 
modified and updated from time to time in accordance with the terms of this 
Agreement. Contractor hereby acknowledges and agrees that a portion of the 
Work for the Unit 5 Scrubber and Unit 6 includes: (a) Work performed under 
the ***, which Work has already been paid by Owner under the ***, and (b) 
Work performed under Duke purchase order FHP01564, which Work has already 
been paid by Owner under such purchase order (but is included as part of 
the Contract Price).


6.3 ***. Each Party shall, in good faith, cooperate with the other and use 
all commercially reasonable efforts to expeditiously update, in accordance 
with the *** as described in Exhibit I, ***.


6.4 Finalization of Schedule. The Parties shall, in good faith, cooperate 
with the other and use all commercially reasonable efforts to expeditiously 
update, in accordance with the *** as described in Exhibit I, the 
Preliminary Schedule for Unit 6 and the Unit 5 Scrubber, respectively, ***. 
Upon the issuance of the Full Notice to Proceed for Unit 6 or the Unit 5 
Scrubber, Contractor shall prepare and make available to Owner at all times 
at the Site, or such other location mutually agreed upon by the Parties, a 
current, working copy of the Schedule depicting all Key Schedule Milestones 
and illustrating the progress which has been made on the Work against the 
Schedule (in hard copy and electronic format), including critical path 
activities interconnected by schedule logics, for Owners review and 
comment. Unless otherwise mutually agreed upon by the Parties, Contractor 
shall update the working copy of the Schedule monthly and shall provide a 
copy to Owner at the Progress Meeting; provided, however, that no update of 
or revisions to the working copy of the Schedule shall be deemed to alter, 
revise or otherwise change any of the Guaranteed Substantial Completion 
Dates, the Guaranteed Final Completion Dates, the Guaranteed Tie-in 
Commencement Date or the Guaranteed Tie-In Completion Date, which shall 
only be amended by a duly executed Change Order or amendment hereto.
 
33

------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.5 Enhanced Project Management System. At any time following the 
finalization of the Schedule, in the event that Contractors Monthly 
Progress Report indicates that Contractor is unlikely to meet either the 
Guaranteed Substantial Completion Date or any Key Schedule Milestone 
identified on Exhibit C with respect to Unit 6 or the Unit 5 Scrubber, 
Contractor shall promptly notify Owner in writing thereof, and the Parties 
shall consult in good faith as to what measures need to be undertaken to 
regain lost time. If Contractors progress on any Key Schedule Milestone 
set forth in the Schedule is, or forecasted to be, delayed by ninety (90) 
days or more as compared to the Schedule, and until Contractors progress 
on such Milestone complies with the Schedule, at the request of Owner, 
Contractor shall, without increase to the Contract Price, establish and 
submit to Owner a comprehensive acceleration plan to regain compliance with 
the Schedule. The Parties shall consult in good faith to determine what 
measures to include in such comprehensive acceleration plan. Such plan 
shall be subject to the approval of Owner, which approval shall not be 
unreasonably withheld. Following such approval by Owner, Contractor shall 
promptly implement such plan. Unless the underlying cause for such delay 
constitutes a Change, neither the preparation nor the implementation of 
such plan shall constitute a Change.


6.6 Unit 5 Scrubber Tie-In. Contractor shall perform Unit 5 Scrubber Tie-In 
in accordance with the Guaranteed Tie-In Commencement Date and Guaranteed 
Tie-In Completion Date, both as may be adjusted in accordance with Exhibit 
I. Owner shall have the right to make adjustments to such outage schedule, 
including delaying or accelerating the Guaranteed Tie-In Commencement Date 
or the Guaranteed Tie-In Completion Date; provided, that as a result of any 
such adjustment, Contractor shall be entitled to an equitable adjustment in 
the Contract Price and the Schedule in accordance with Article 8. *** (or 
longer if Contractor is entitled to a Change upon inspection of the tie-in 
ducts which reveals differing conditions) to such portion of the Site as 
Contractor may reasonably require to perform the Work during the outage for 
Unit 5 Scrubber Tie-In.
 
7. 	COMPENSATION AND PAYMENT

7.1 Cash Flow Plan. *** as Exhibit F-1 ***. In connection with and as part 
of the ***, the Contractor shall update and revise the Cash Flow Plan in 
accordance with Exhibit I. On or before the ***, Owner shall issue a Change 
Order to capture all of the updates made to the Cash Flow Plan pursuant to 
Exhibit I, and an updated Cash Flow Plan shall be attached to this 
Agreement as Exhibit F.


7.2 Payments of the Contract Price.

(a) Payments.

(i) In consideration of Contractors performance and provision of the Work 
as specified in this Agreement, Contractor shall invoice and
 
34

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Owner shall pay to Contractor that portion of the Contract Price (a 
Milestone Payment) of Unit 6 or the Unit 5 Scrubber assigned to each 
milestone set forth in Exhibit F-1 (a Milestone) that Contractor 
completes in accordance with this Agreement. Owner and Contractor agree 
that each Milestone Payment is a reasonable representation of the value of 
the related Milestone.

(ii) Upon completion of each Milestone, irrespective of sequence, for which 
Contractor has not been previously paid, Contractor shall submit to Owner 
an invoice for the Milestone Payment with respect to such Milestone (the 
Invoice). *** Contractor shall make available such documentation and 
materials as Owner may reasonably require to substantiate Contractors 
right to payment of such Invoice.

(iii) If at any time the *** contained within any Monthly Progress Report 
indicates that the actual *** incurred by Contractor in performing the Work 
exceeds the *** (the amount of such excess, the ***), then the Parties 
shall share in such *** as provided in Section 7.2(b) below. If, at the 
latest of the Final Completion of Unit 6 and the Unit 5 Scrubber, the *** 
contained within the final Monthly Progress Report indicates that the 
actual *** incurred by Contractor in performing the Work is less than the 
*** (the amount of such shortage, the ***), then the Parties shall share 
in such *** as provided in Section 7.2(b) below.

(b) ***.

(i) ***.

(A) Owner shall pay *** of all *** incurred by Contractor in performing the 
Work until such time as the *** incurred by Contractor in performing the 
Work reaches the ***.
 
35

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(B) At such time as *** incurred by Contractor in performing the Work 
reaches the ***, Owner thereafter shall pay *** of all *** incurred by 
Contractor in performing the Work in excess of the *** until such time as 
the *** portion of the *** to be borne by Contractor in performing the Work 
reaches the ***.

(C) At such time as the *** share of the *** to be borne by Contractor in 
performing the Work reaches the ***, Owner shall thereafter pay *** of all 
further *** incurred by Contractor thereafter in performing the Work in 
excess of the ***, but without contingency, fee or G&A.

(D) Notwithstanding the above or anything else in this Agreement to the 
contrary, the Contractors total liability for all *** shall be capped at 
the ***.

(ii) ***. If, at the latest of the Final Completion of Unit 6 and the Unit 
5 Scrubber, the Craft Labor Cost Comparison contained within the final 
Monthly Progress Report for the Project indicates the existence of a ***, 
then Owner shall be required to pay to Contractor, as part of the 
applicable Final Payment Invoice, an amount equal to *** of such ***.

(iii) Change Orders. Concurrently with the payment by Owner of any *** 
payment, Owner shall issue a Change Order, and Contractor shall accept such 
Change Order, (a) to increase the Contract Price for Unit 6 and Unit 5 
Scrubber by the amount of such payment, with such increases to be allocated 
proportionally between Unit 6 and the Unit 5 Scrubber in the same ratio as 
the craft labor hours allocable to each scope of Work, and (b) to adjust 
the Target Labor Cash Flow Plan set forth in Exhibit F-2 to reflect the 
existence of a ***. Concurrently with the payment by Owner of any *** 
payment, Owner shall issue a Change Order to decrease the Contract Price 
for Unit 6 and Unit 5 Scrubber by the amount of such payment, with such 
decreases to be allocated proportionally between Unit 6 and the Unit 5 
Scrubber in the same ratio as the craft labor hours allocable to each scope 
of Work.

(c) Revisions to Cash Flow Plan. If any Monthly Progress Report shows that 
the amount actually paid or payable by Owner for *** incurred by Contractor 
in performing the Work through the end of the month for which such Monthly 
Progress Report relates varies by more than *** in each of two consecutive 
Monthly Progress Reports from the amounts scheduled to be paid for
 
36

------------------------------------------------------------------------
*** during such two month period as reflected in the ***, prior to the 
issuance of the next Invoice, Contractor shall create a revised forecast of 
future payments to be made by Owner for the *** to be incurred by 
Contractor in performing the Work for the Project (it being understood that 
the intent of such revised forecast shall be to make adjustments necessary 
to eliminate such variance), which revised forecast shall be reasonably 
acceptable to Owner, and Owner shall issue a Change Order to amend the *** 
plan to reflect such revised forecast; provided, that such revised forecast 
shall not result in any adjustment to the Contract Price except when the 
true-up shows that the actual *** exceed the ***.

(d) True Up of Contract Price.

(i) As the *** or in situations in which the actual costs for such Work 
either: (a) shows a variance (increase or decrease) as compared to *** for 
such Work as reflected in Exhibit I, or (b) such Work is completed and the 
actual, final price differs from the *** for such Work as reflected in 
Exhibit I, as applicable, Owner shall issue a Change Order to adjust the 
Contract Price. As a result of such Change Order, Contractor shall issue 
either a debit or credit, as applicable, to its subsequent monthly 
Invoice(s) to reflect any change in Contract Price pursuant to such Change 
Order, unless the Parties mutually agree to allocate the impact of such 
Change Order through a revision and reforecast to future Milestone Payments 
in the Milestone Payment Schedule in Exhibit F-1.

(ii) If a *** plan set forth in Exhibit F-2 shows a variance (either above 
or below) in *** as compared to the *** plan set forth in Exhibit F-2 for 
such date, Contractor shall issue either a debit or credit, as applicable, 
to its next monthly Invoice to reflect the variance between the *** plan. 
Such adjustment shall not be a Change or entitle Contractor to a Change 
Order, except the *** plan may be adjusted to the extent such variance 
affects the *** plan set forth in Exhibit F-2.


7.3 Invoicing and Payments.

(a) If any Invoice is deficient in any material respect, Contractor shall 
be required to resubmit that Invoice in proper form; provided, however, 
that Owner shall pay any portion of it that is not deficient or subject to 
dispute. Owner shall review each Invoice and shall endeavor to make 
exceptions, if any, by providing Contractor with written notice fifteen 
(15) Days after Owner receives the Invoice and such substantiating 
documentation and materials as Owner may have reasonably required. 
Notwithstanding anything in this Article to the contrary, the failure of 
Owner to raise an exception shall not preclude Owner from subsequently 
seeking, and Contractor from paying, a refund of any amounts to which 
Contractor was not entitled under this Agreement, and Owner may,
 
37

------------------------------------------------------------------------
by any payment pursuant to Section 7.3(b) below, make any correction or 
modification that should properly be made to any amount previously 
considered due.

(b) If Owner provides no exceptions within such time period, Owner shall 
pay Contractor, within thirty (30) Days of receipt of the Invoice and such 
substantiating documentation and materials as Owner may have reasonably 
required, in U.S. dollars the amounts designated in such Invoice, plus any 
additions and less any deductions which may have become due under this 
Agreement, as reflected in the Invoice. Any amount of an Invoice that Owner 
disputes shall be resolved promptly in accordance with Article 28. Once the 
dispute is resolved, Owner or Contractor, as applicable, shall pay any 
amount owing promptly after the date of the final resolution. If for any 
reason Owner fails to pay Contractor for all sums due and owing (other than 
sums that are the subject of a good faith dispute or permitted to be 
withheld pursuant to this Section 7.3(b)) within thirty (30) Days after 
receipt of a substantiated Invoice which complies with the requirements of 
this Article, a late payment charge shall accrue that is based on an annual 
percentage rate (APR) equal to the Prime Interest Rate plus one percentage 
point (1%), payable each month or portion thereof that payment is delayed 
beyond such 30th Day.

(c) If any Services performed or Equipment supplied by Contractor is not in 
accordance with this Agreement, Owner may withhold from any Invoice the 
cost of rectification or replacement until such rectification or 
replacement has been completed, and, if Contractor is failing to perform 
any Services or provide any Equipment in accordance with this Agreement and 
Owner has so notified Contractor in writing, Owner may withhold the 
estimated value of such Work until it has been performed or provided in 
accordance with this Agreement.


7.4 Cash Flow.

(a) The Parties acknowledge and agree that, in arranging for financing for 
the Project and in managing its cash flow, Owner is relying on all 
Milestone Payments to be made in accordance with the Cash Flow in Exhibit F 
and that any significant excess over the amounts set forth in the Cash Flow 
Plan would adversely affect Owners ability to manage its cash flow. 
Accordingly and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article 
(but subject to the last sentence of Section 7.4(b) below), unless 
otherwise mutually agreed in writing, Contractor shall not submit and Owner 
shall not be obligated to pay any Invoice with respect to Unit 6 or the 
Unit 5 Scrubber that would otherwise be due and payable in any given 
calendar month, calendar quarter or calendar year to the extent that such 
Invoice, together with all other Invoices issued during such calendar 
month, calendar quarter or calendar year, as applicable, exceeds the Cash 
Flow Plan for Unit 6 or the Unit 5 Scrubber, unless otherwise agreed to in 
writing by Owner, except that Owner shall pay all actual *** anytime when 
trued-up notwithstanding the Cash Flow Plan. Contractor shall not be 
entitled to any interest or late payment charge with respect to any amount 
that cannot be billed and is carried forward pursuant to this Section.

(b) The Parties acknowledge that nothing in this Section limits, and the 
Parties shall not construe this Section as limiting, Contractors ability 
to accelerate or substitute Milestones, provided that Owner shall not be 
obligated to pay more than the Cash Flow
 
38

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Plan for completion of any accelerated or substituted Milestone for any 
Unit 6 or the Unit 5 Scrubber. The parties also acknowledge and agree that 
nothing in the Section limits, and the Parties shall not construe this 
Section as limiting, Contractors ability to update the Schedule in 
accordance with Section 6.2. In the event that the dates for the Milestones 
set forth in an updated Schedule forecast no longer match the dates for the 
corresponding Cash Flow Plan, the parties shall cooperate to revise the 
Cash Flow Plan to match as closely as possible the updated Schedule to the 
extent that such revisions will not adversely impact the ability of Owner 
to arrange for financing for the Project and to manage its cash flow as 
contemplated by this Section.


7.5 Final Payment. Upon achievement of Final Completion of Unit 6 or the 
Unit 5 Scrubber, Contractor shall submit to Owner an invoice for the final 
Milestone Payment and other payments due under this Agreement with respect 
to Unit 6 or the Unit 5 Scrubber (the Final Payment Invoice) which shall 
set forth all remaining amounts due to it pursuant to this Agreement with 
respect to Unit 6 or the Unit 5 Scrubber. When submitting the applicable 
Final Payment Invoice, Contractor shall submit a written discharge, in form 
and substance reasonably satisfactory to Owner, confirming that the total 
of the applicable Final Payment Invoice represents full and final 
settlement of all monies due to Contractor under this Agreement with 
respect to Unit 6 or the Unit 5 Scrubber. If requested by Owner, the 
applicable Final Payment Invoice shall also include a waiver (or a bond if 
a Lien exists to indemnify Owner against such Lien) of any Liens; provided
, that the waiver or bond shall be conditioned on Contractor receiving 
payment pursuant to such Final Payment Invoice. The procedures set forth in 
Section 7.3 above (including application of any late payment charge) shall 
be followed for payment of the applicable Final Payment Invoice, and Owner 
shall be entitled to offset against any invoice or Final Payment Invoice 
any undisputed amounts owing by Contractor to Owner under this Agreement 
with respect to Unit 6 or the Unit 5 Scrubber, including any undisputed 
Liquidated Damages as may be applicable.


7.6 Certification by Contractor. In each Invoice, Contractor shall certify 
as follows:

There are no known Liens (or such Liens are bonded over) outstanding at 
the date of this invoice, all amounts that are due and payable to any third 
party (including Subcontractors) with respect to the Work as of the date of 
this invoice have been paid or are included in the amount requested in this 
invoice, and, except for those bills not paid but so included and amounts 
disputed between Owner and Contractor, there is no known basis for the 
creation of any Liens except in respect to payments to Subcontractors 
withheld for proper reasons. Contractor hereby waives and releases, to the 
extent of the receipt of payment requested in this invoice, any right to 
any Lien with respect to payment for such portion of the Work included in 
this invoice.


7.7 No Acceptance by Payment. Owners payment of any invoice, including a 
Final Payment Invoice, does not constitute approval or acceptance of any 
item or cost in that invoice nor shall be construed to relieve Contractor 
of any of its obligations under this Agreement.


7.8 Revenue from Use of Unit 6 and Facility. Owner shall be entitled to all 
revenue derived from or in connection with operation or use of Unit 6 and 
the Facility before (as contemplated in Section 10.4) and after the 
Substantial Completion Date for Unit 6.
 
39

------------------------------------------------------------------------
8. 	CHANGE ORDERS & PROVISIONAL SUMS

8.1 Change Requests. Without invalidating this Agreement, Owner may order 
changes in the Specifications or the Work consisting of additions, 
deletions or other revisions (each, a Change), including deletion of Unit 
6 or the Unit 5 Scrubber (such deletion being only in the event: (x) Owner 
is denied the DENR permit for Unit 6, or (y) Owner has cancelled the Work 
associated with Unit 6 or the Unit 5 Scrubber and does not intend to 
proceed with another contractor for such Work); provided, that Owner may 
not delete all Work through this Article. Without limiting the generality 
of the foregoing, Owner may order:

(a) an increase or decrease in the quantity of any Work,

(b) any Work omitted,

(c) a Change in the character or quality or kind of any such Work,

(d) a Change in the levels, lines, position and dimensions of any part of 
the Project,

(e) execution of additional Services of any kind prudent for the completion 
of the Work, or

(f) a Change in any specified sequence or timing of the Services.


If Owner desires to make a Change, it shall submit a written proposal to 
Contractor describing the Change requested. Contractor shall promptly 
review Owners proposal and submit to Owner an estimate of the cost to 
develop a Change Order for such Change, such development costs to be 
determined on a time and materials basis utilizing the rates set forth in 
Exhibit K. If the estimated costs to develop the Change Order are 
reasonably acceptable to Owner, Owner shall promptly provide notice thereof 
to Contractor in writing. Upon receipt of such notice, Contractors Project 
Manager shall promptly notify Owner in writing, as soon as practicable, 
either by giving reasons why Contractor, either directly or indirectly 
through a Subcontractor, could not effect such Change (if this is the case) 
or by submitting a proposed Change Order, which shall include in reasonable 
detail:
 
  	(i) 	the effect and impact, if any, that the Change would have, in 
Contractors reasonable judgment, on the Work, the Contract Price or the 
Schedule,
 
  	(ii) 	Contractors proposal for any necessary modifications to the Work, 
the Contract Price or the Schedule, and
 
  	(iii) 	Contractors proposal for any necessary modifications to any 
other provisions of this Agreement, including the Specifications, the 
Milestones, the Milestone Payments or the Performance Guarantees.
 
40

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Contractor shall provide Owner such supporting documentation for the 
foregoing as Owner may reasonably request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, 
Contractor shall not be entitled to any increase in the Contract Price or 
any extension of the Schedule if such Change was necessary as a result of a 
breach by Contractor of this Agreement. Owner shall, as soon as practicable 
after receipt of such submittal and supporting documentation, respond with 
any comments or questions. Contractor shall not delay any Work while 
awaiting a response. If Owner responds with comments or questions, 
Contractor shall endeavor to address such comments or answer such questions 
as soon as practicable. If Owner decides not to proceed with a Change, it 
shall reimburse Contractor for its efforts in developing the estimates and 
other information regarding the potential Change, on a time and material 
basis utilizing the rates set forth in Exhibit K (such reimbursement to be 
either outside the Contract Price or through a separate Change Order); 
provided, that Owner shall only be required to reimburse Contractor if 
Contractor has complied with the cost proposal requirements set forth 
above. If Owner wishes to proceed with the Change, Owner shall issue a 
written order to Contractor authorizing the Change and setting forth any 
revisions to this Agreement necessary to effect the Change (the Change 
Order). If Contractor refuses to accept such necessary revisions in the 
Change Order, Owner shall be entitled to require Contractor to continue to 
perform its obligations hereunder as would be modified by the Change Order; 
provided, that, if Owner requires Contractor to so perform, (x) the Parties 
shall resolve the Dispute over the necessary revisions in accordance with 
the dispute resolution procedures set forth in Article 28 and (y) if the 
Change requires additional or disputed Work, Owner shall continue to pay 
Contractor pursuant to the payment terms hereof based, subject to 
resolution of the Dispute pursuant to Article 28, on the time and materials 
rates set forth in Exhibit K. Once the Dispute is resolved, any amount 
owing will be paid within thirty (30) Days after the date of resolution.


If Contractor experiences an increase in costs or a delay in Contractors 
ability to perform the Work due to a delay in the delivery of any Owner 
Equipment or a delay resulting from a defect in any Owner Equipment or a 
breach of the Owner Equipment Contracts by the suppliers of the Owner 
Equipment, and such delay or defect is not the result of Contractors 
failure to comply with the requirements of this Agreement, Contractor shall 
be entitled to a Change and an equitable adjustment in the Contract Price 
and/or the Schedule.


Contractor shall have the right to request a Change but shall have no right 
to require a Change which is not contemplated by this Agreement without the 
prior written consent of Owner. If Contractor determines that a Change is 
necessary or advisable for any reason, including a Change in Law, 
Contractor shall give Owner written notice within twenty-one (21) Days 
thereof.


Owner may include in any Change Order provision that any additional 
Services shall be performed and any additional Equipment shall be provided 
on a time and materials basis. Contractor shall then be paid for such Work 
under the terms set out in Exhibit K. Contractor shall furnish to Owner 
such receipts or other vouchers as may be necessary to prove the amounts 
paid and labor performed and, before ordering materials, shall submit to 
Owner quotations for the same for its approval (such approval not to be 
unreasonably delayed or withheld). Promptly after the end of each month, 
Contractor shall deliver to Owner a priced statement of the labor and 
materials used during such month associated with such Change.
 
41

------------------------------------------------------------------------
9. 	FORCE MAJEURE

9.1 Event of Force Majeure. The performance by Owner or Contractor under 
this Agreement shall be excused to the extent that such Partys performance 
is delayed or prevented by reason of an event of Force Majeure. If a Party 
is or will be reasonably prevented from performing its obligations under 
this Agreement by an event of Force Majeure, such Party shall use all 
commercially reasonable efforts to remove the cause affecting such 
non-performance and to minimize any delay in or impact upon the performance 
of this Agreement or any damage to or other impact upon the Equipment or 
the Owner Equipment. If an event of Force Majeure occurs, the Parties shall 
negotiate ***, and (b) the Contract Price; provided, that Contractor shall 
*** on Change Orders which result from an event of Force Majeure.


9.2 Notice. If a Party is or will be reasonably prevented from performing 
its obligations under this Agreement by an event of Force Majeure, then it 
shall notify the other Party of the obligations, the performance of which 
is or will be prevented, and the nature and cause of the event in writing 
within thirty (30) Days after the notifying Party or its Project Manager 
becomes aware, through the exercise of reasonable diligence, of the event 
of Force Majeure. The Party affected by an event of Force Majeure shall 
provide the other Party with weekly updates (a) estimating its expected 
duration, the cost of any remedial action, and the probable impact on the 
performance of its obligations hereunder, (b) of the actions taken to 
remove or overcome the event of Force Majeure and (c) of the efforts taken 
to mitigate or limit damages to the other Party. The Party affected by an 
event of Force Majeure shall also provide written notice to the other Party 
when it ceases to be so affected.


9.3 Suspension; Termination Due to Force Majeure. If any event of Force 
Majeure by Contractor delays Contractors performance for an aggregate time 
period greater than *** consecutive Days, then Owner, in its sole and 
absolute discretion, shall have the right to terminate this Agreement 
without penalty upon payment of all due and owing payments in accordance 
with Article 23. If any event of Force Majeure by Owner delays Contractors 
performance for an aggregate time period greater than *** consecutive Days, 
then Contractor, in its sole and absolute discretion, shall have the right 
to suspend performance and demobilize under this Agreement without penalty 
in accordance with Section 23.7. If any event of Force Majeure delays 
Contractors performance in any three year time period for an aggregate 
time period greater than *** Days, then Contractor, in its sole and 
absolute discretion, shall have the right to terminate performance and 
demobilize under this Agreement without penalty, and such termination shall 
be deemed and treated as a termination under Section 23.4.
 
10. 	INSPECTION: PERFORMANCE TESTING: PERFORMANCE GUARANTEES

10.1 Mechanical Completion Inspection. At least thirty (30) Days prior to 
the date upon which Contractor expects that Unit 6 or the Unit 5 Scrubber 
will satisfy the conditions for Mechanical Completion set forth in Section 
11.1, Contractor shall notify Owner in writing thereof and shall take 
necessary measures to allow a preliminary Mechanical Completion inspection 
of the relevant Unit 6 or the Unit 5 Scrubber to be conducted by Owner and 
its representatives. Contractor shall include with such notice documents 
and information prudent or convenient for Owner to determine whether Unit 6 
or the Unit 5 Scrubber will satisfy the
 
42

------------------------------------------------------------------------
conditions for Mechanical Completion set forth in Section 11.1. If Owner 
notifies Contractor of any deficiencies in the Work, Contractor shall 
immediately remedy such deficiencies as part of the Contract Price and 
provide Owner with the relevant documentary evidence of the correction.


10.2 Performance Testing. As soon as reasonably practicable following 
Mechanical Completion of Unit 6 or the Unit 5 Scrubber as set forth in 
Article 11 below, and after providing Owner at least five (5) Days prior 
written notice (unless Owner agrees to a shorter notice period or 
regulatory requirements necessitate a longer notice period), Contractor 
shall commence Performance Testing of Unit 6 or the Unit 5 Scrubber. All 
Performance Testing shall be conducted in accordance with the Testing 
Procedures developed in accordance with the requirements of Exhibit L-1 or 
Exhibit L-2, as applicable, and approved by Owner (such approval not to be 
unreasonably withheld or delayed). Owner and its agents, representatives 
and invitees, including any independent third party inspector, shall have 
the right to attend and witness the Performance Testing. After the 
completion of each successful Performance Test, Contractor shall determine 
and submit to Owner, in writing and electronically, the raw data and 
completed results of such Performance Test, together with a comparison of 
such results to the applicable Performance Guarantees and a statement 
whether such results satisfy the applicable Performance Guarantees. By 
submitting such raw data and completed results, Contractor represents that 
such raw data, and the conversion of such raw data into the test results, 
is accurate. All Performance Testing shall be conducted in conformance with 
the applicable requirements of this Agreement and the Testing Procedures 
and with the required prior notification to Owner.


10.3 Satisfaction of Performance Testing. Within ten (10) Days after it 
receives the results for all of the Performance Testing, the underlying raw 
data and other information required by Section 10.2, Owner shall respond in 
writing to Contractor stating whether (a) such Performance Testing was 
performed according to the Testing Procedures, and (b) the results of such 
Performance Testing satisfied the applicable Performance Guarantees, or, if 
Owner does not believe that is the case, Owner shall provide its reasons 
therefore. Upon its receipt of any such response from Owner that is not in 
the affirmative, Contractor shall promptly take whatever action shall be 
necessary to cure the defect in the Performance Testing, adjust or modify 
any of the Equipment, or request adjustment or modification of Owner 
Equipment in accordance with Section 3.1(a)(ii), or otherwise in order to 
satisfy the applicable Performance Guarantees so noted by Owner and shall 
promptly repeat the Performance Testing in accordance with Section 10.2 
and this Section. If, following the Performance Testing, either: (a) Owner 
agrees that the Performance Guarantees have been satisfied and that the 
Performance Testing was performed according to the Testing Procedures, (b) 
the failure to meet any Performance Guarantees is attributable to the 
performance of Owner Equipment (other than due to Contractors obligations 
set forth in Section 3.1(a)(ii)(B)), or (c) Owner fails to respond within 
the time period set forth above, then the applicable Performance Guarantees 
shall be deemed to have been satisfied on the date of completion of such 
Performance Testing for the purposes of calculating Delay Liquidated 
Damages. Notwithstanding anything in this Article to the contrary, no 
agreement, confirmation, statement or otherwise of Owner relating to 
whether the Performance Testing was performed according to the Testing 
Procedures or whether the results of such Performance Testing satisfied the 
applicable Performance Guarantees shall relieve Contractor of any of its 
obligations under this Agreement. All costs that Contractor incurs in 
satisfying its obligations under this Article are the sole responsibility 
of Contractor and included in the Contract Price, except that
 
43

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Contractor shall be reimbursed through a Change Order for additional costs 
it may incur due to problems with Owner Equipment that are not the result 
of Contractors failure to comply with the requirements set forth in this 
Agreement (other than Section 3.1(a)(ii)(A)), including for any repeat 
Performance Testing and the consumables and spare parts associated 
therewith.


10.4 Owners Right to Operate Prior to Satisfaction of Performance 
Guarantees. If Unit 6 or the Unit 5 Scrubber fails to satisfy the 
Performance Guarantees during the Performance Testing for Unit 6 or the 
Unit 5 Scrubber or fails to achieve Substantial Completion by the 
Guaranteed Substantial Completion Date for Unit 6 or the Unit 5 Scrubber 
and Unit 6 or the Unit 5 Scrubber can be operated in compliance with 
applicable Laws, Owner, in its sole discretion, shall have the right 
nonetheless to operate Unit 6 or the Unit 5 Scrubber and shall give 
Contractor written notice of its decision; provided; that if by doing so 
Owner would cause material damage or deterioration to Unit 6 or the Unit 5 
Scrubber, Contractor shall not be responsible for such material damage or 
deterioration to Unit 6 or the Unit 5 Scrubber to the extent caused by 
Owners election to operate prior to Contractor having an opportunity to 
cure any Defects. If Owner elects to operate Unit 6 or the Unit 5 Scrubber 
and, during such time, does not permit Contractor to cure the Defects 
necessary for Unit 6 or the Unit 5 Scrubber to satisfy the Minimum 
Performance Guarantees of Unit 6 or the Unit 5 Scrubber, then the 
Guaranteed Substantial Completion Date and Guaranteed Final Completion Date 
(if such dates have not passed) for Unit 6 or the Unit 5 Scrubber shall be 
extended on an equitable basis until such time as Owner tenders Unit 6 or 
the Unit 5 Scrubber to Contractor for further Services and Performance 
Testing, and Contractor shall be entitled to a Change Order for equitable 
schedule and/or price adjustment. Owner shall bear the risk of loss during 
such time as it operates Unit 6 or the Unit 5 Scrubber. Owners operation 
of Unit 6 or the Unit 5 Scrubber under this Section shall not reduce 
Contractors obligations under this Agreement, including Contractors 
obligation to cause Unit 6 or the Unit 5 Scrubber to satisfy the 
Specifications and Performance Guarantees for Unit 6 or the Unit 5 
Scrubber, except for normal wear and tear, degradation, and operation not 
in accordance with Contractors instructions. In any event, if Owner elects 
to operate any Unit 6 or the Unit 5 Scrubber as contemplated in this 
Section 10.4 for more than *** Days, then Substantial Completion of Unit 6 
or Unit 5 Scrubber shall be deemed to have been achieved on the day Owner 
made such election, and ***.


10.5 Failure of Component to Meet Performance Criteria. If Unit 6 or the 
Unit 5 Scrubber satisfies the Performance Guarantees of Unit 6 or the Unit 
5 Scrubber under this Agreement but an item of Equipment within Unit 6 or 
the Unit 5 Scrubber does not meet its specific performance criteria as set 
forth in the Specifications, Contractor shall, in addition to its Warranty 
obligations hereunder, provide Owner with all commercially reasonably paid 
assistance in pursuing the available remedies against the Subcontractor 
which provided such Equipment. This assistance may include but shall not be 
limited to assistance in enforcing the repair, replacement or refurbishment 
of the Equipment by Subcontractor or the collection of monetary remedies 
from the Subcontractor for failure to meet its guarantees. The Owner shall 
be entitled to the benefits of any recovery from such Subcontractor.

12. 	DELAY AND PERFORMANCE LIQUIDATED DAMAGES; EARLY COMPLETION BONUS

12.1 Delay Liquidated Damages.

(a) The Parties agree that it would be extremely difficult and 
impracticable under presently known and anticipated facts and circumstances 
to ascertain and fix the actual damages Owner would incur if Contractor 
does not achieve Substantial Completion of Unit 6 by the Guaranteed 
Substantial Completion Date for Unit 6 (as the Guaranteed Substantial 
Completion Date for Unit 6 may be extended due to Force Majeure, Owner 
caused delays, differing site conditions, discovery of Hazardous Materials, 
Changes in Law, or as otherwise contemplated in this Agreement), and, 
accordingly, if Contractor does not achieve Substantial Completion of Unit 
6 by that date, subject to Section 12.1(c) below, Owners sole and 
exclusive remedy for such delay shall be to recover from Contractor as 
liquidated damages, and not as a penalty, the Delay Liquidated Damages for 
each Day that Substantial Completion of Unit 6 is delayed beyond the 
Guaranteed Substantial Completion Date for Unit 6; provided, that in no 
event shall the aggregate Delay Liquidated Damages for Unit 6 exceed its 
Delay Liquidated Damages Cap.

(b) The Parties agree that it would be extremely difficult and 
impracticable under presently known and anticipated facts and circumstances 
to ascertain and fix the actual damages Owner would incur if (i) Unit 5 
Scrubber Tie-In does not commence by the Guaranteed Tie-In Commencement 
Date, (ii) Contractor does not complete the successful tie-in of the Unit 5 
Scrubber by the Guaranteed Tie-In Completion Date or (iii) after the 
successful Tie-In of the Unit 5 Scrubber, Contractor does not achieve 
Substantial Completion of the Unit 5 Scrubber by the Guaranteed Substantial 
Completion Date (in each case, as the Guaranteed Tie-In Commencement Date, 
the Guaranteed Tie-in
 
47

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Completion Date or the Guaranteed Substantial Completion Date of the Unit 5 
Scrubber, as applicable, may be extended due to Force Majeure, Owner caused 
delays, differing site conditions, discovery of Hazardous Materials, 
Changes in Law, or as otherwise contemplated in this Agreement), and, 
accordingly, upon the occurrence of either event, subject to Section 
12.1(c) below, Owners sole and exclusive remedy therefore shall be to 
recover from Contractor as liquidated damages, and not as a penalty, the 
Delay Liquidated Damages for each Day after the Guaranteed Tie-In 
Commencement Date that Unit 5 Scrubber Tie-In does not commence, each Day 
after the Guaranteed Tie-In Completion Date that the successful Tie-In of 
the Unit 5 Scrubber has not been achieved, and, after the successful Tie-In 
of the Unit 5 Scrubber has been achieved, each Day after the Guaranteed 
Substantial Completion of the Unit 5 Scrubber that Substantial Completion 
of the Unit 5 Scrubber is not achieved, as applicable; provided, that in no 
event shall the aggregate Delay Liquidated Damages for the Unit 5 Scrubber 
exceed its Delay Liquidated Damages Cap. The Parties hereby agree that the 
Delay Liquidated Damages payable pursuant to this Section 12.1(b) shall not 
be duplicative. By way of example, if Contractor is assessed Delay 
Liquidated Damages due to the commencement of Unit 5 Scrubber Tie-In on a 
date that is two (2) days after the Guaranteed Tie-In Commencement Date, 
Contractor shall not be liable for Delay Liquidated Damages for the same 
two (2) day delay in completing Unit 5 Scrubber Tie-In or in achieving 
Substantial Completion of the Unit 5 Scrubber.

(c) Contractor shall have no liability or obligation to pay Delay 
Liquidated Damages to Owner hereunder for any delay in Contractors 
performance of the Work to the extent attributable to the performance of 
any Owner Equipment, unless such delay is the result of Contractors 
failure to comply with the requirements set forth in this Agreement.


12.2 Performance Liquidated Damages.

(a) The Parties agree that it would be extremely difficult and 
impracticable under presently known and anticipated facts and circumstances 
to ascertain and fix the actual damages Owner would incur if Unit 6 or the 
Unit 5 Scrubber does not meet the corresponding Performance Guarantees on 
or before the Guaranteed Final Completion Date for Unit 6 or the Unit 5 
Scrubber, and, accordingly, and subject to Section 12.2(c) below, Owners 
sole and exclusive remedy for such failure shall be to recover from 
Contractor as liquidated damages, and not as a penalty, the applicable 
Performance Liquidated Damages; provided, however, that in no event shall 
the aggregate Performance Liquidated Damages for Unit 6 or the Unit 5 
Scrubber exceed the respective Performance Liquidated Damages Cap.

(b) Notwithstanding anything set forth in Section 12.2(a) to the contrary, 
Contractor shall have the right, exercisable by written notice to Owner, to 
delay the payment of Performance Liquidated Damages by Contractor with 
respect to Unit 6 or the Unit 5 Scrubber and to continue to use all 
commercially reasonable efforts to achieve the Performance Guarantees of 
Unit 6 or the Unit 5 Scrubber for a period of up to *** after the 
Guaranteed Final Completion Date for Unit 6 or the Unit 5 Scrubber.
 
48

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(c) Contractor shall have no liability or obligation to pay any Performance 
Liquidated Damages to Owner hereunder for the failure to meet any 
Performance Guarantee to the extent that such failure is attributable to 
the performance of any Owner Equipment, unless such failure is the result 
of Contractors failure to comply with the requirements set forth in 
Section 3.1(a)(ii)(B).


12.3 Early Completion Bonus. Owner shall pay Contractor the Early 
Completion Bonus for Unit 6 for Contractors early achievement of 
Substantial Completion of the Work for Unit 6 as compared to the Guaranteed 
Substantial Completion Date for Unit 6. Contractor shall only be entitled 
to such Early Completion Bonus if the Work meets the Minimum Performance 
Guarantees for Unit 6 at the time of Substantial Completion of Unit 6.


12.4 Payment. Unless disputed in good faith, the Liquidated Damages 
specified in Section 12.1, Section 12.2 and the Bonus specified in Section 
12.3 shall be due and payable within thirty (30) Days after written demand 
by Owner or Contractor, as the case may be. Any undisputed Liquidated 
Damages or Bonus that remain unpaid after the expiration of such ten-Day 
period shall bear interest at the Prime Interest Rate plus 1% per annum or 
the highest rate allowed by law, whichever is less. If any Liquidated 
Damages or Bonus are disputed by either Party, any Liquidated Damages or 
Bonus that are determined to be payable pursuant to the resolution of such 
dispute in accordance with this Agreement shall also bear interest from the 
expiration of the ten-Day period referred to above at the Prime Interest 
Rate plus 1% per annum or the highest rate allowed by law, whichever is 
less. Notwithstanding the assessment of interest, and in addition to its 
other rights and remedies, Owner and Contractor shall have the right to 
offset the amount of any unpaid Liquidated Damages or Bonus plus interest 
against any amounts due or that may become due to Contractor or Owner (as 
the case may be) under this Agreement.
 
13. 	WARRANTY

13.1 Services Warranty Period. Contractor warrants that the Services will 
be performed in a professional and workmanlike manner, will conform to the 
requirements of this Agreement, including the requirements set forth in 
Section 3.1(a)(ii), and will reflect competent professional knowledge and 
judgment. For Unit 6 and the Unit 5 Scrubber, if any portion of the 
Services fails to comply with this warranty obligation and Contractor is so 
notified in writing prior to *** after the respective Substantial 
Completion Date (the Services Warranty Period), Contractor will promptly 
re-perform such portion of the Services without additional compensation 
from Owner or, if re-performance is impossible or commercially 
impracticable, Owner and Contractor shall meet and discuss in good faith an 
equitable way to resolve such matter in order to place Owner in as good a 
position as Owner would have been in had there been no such breach of the 
warranty obligation. If the Parties are unable to resolve such matter in a 
manner reasonably acceptable to both Parties, either Party may initiate the 
Dispute resolution procedures set forth in Article 28.


13.2 Equipment Warranty Period. Contractor warrants that the Equipment 
furnished to Owner will be free from Defects in workmanship and material 
and will conform to this Agreement, including the Specifications, for a 
period of *** from the earlier of (a) the date care, custody and control to 
the Equipment is transferred to Owner, or (b) the date Substantial 
Completion of Unit 6 or the Unit 5 Scrubber is achieved. Notwithstanding 
the foregoing, the Equipment Warranty Period for each item on a Substantial 
Completion Punch List shall
 
49

------------------------------------------------------------------------
commence upon Contractors completion (or buying down) of, and Owners 
acceptance of, the particular Punch List item and shall continue until the 
*** thereof (the warranty periods set forth in this Section are, 
collectively, referred to as the Equipment Warranty Period).


13.3 Extension of Warranty Periods. If a Defect (as defined in Section 13.4
) is discovered within the Services Warranty Period or Equipment Warranty 
Period, as applicable, and such Defect is not cured to the reasonable 
satisfaction of Owner, then the Services Warranty Period or Equipment 
Warranty Period, as applicable, shall be extended to the *** of the date 
such Defect was corrected, but only with respect to the Equipment or 
Service that was the subject of such Defect. In no event shall any Services 
Warranty Period or Equipment Warranty Period for Unit 6 or the Unit 5 
Scrubber extend beyond *** from the Substantial Completion Date for Unit 6 
or Unit 5 Scrubber, respectively.


13.4 Defects. If, within the Services Warranty Period or Equipment Warranty 
Period, as applicable, deviations from, breaches of, or failures of the 
foregoing warranties (Defects) in the Equipment or Services are 
discovered by Owner or Contractor, Contractor shall, commence within a 
timely manner upon being discovered or upon notice from Owner to correct 
those Defects, including re-performance or re-provision of any affected 
portion of the Work and repair of any resulting damage, and shall 
demonstrate to Owners reasonable satisfaction that the Defects have been 
properly corrected. Warranty work critical to the operation of the Facility 
shall be performed at such time and in such manner as to take into 
consideration Owners requirements to avoid disruption of Owners 
operations at the Facility. Contractor shall be responsible for, and shall 
pay as and when due for, all inspection, removal, packaging, 
transportation, installation, consulting and other costs for the correction 
of Defects. Owner shall provide Contractor with reasonable access at the 
Site to correct Defects; provided, that any such access shall be 
restricted, and subject to such conditions, as Owner may have instituted 
generally for its contractors.


13.5 Responsibility for Warranty Work. Contractor shall have primary 
liability with respect to the warranties in this Agreement, whether or not 
any Defect or other matter is also covered by a warranty of a Subcontractor 
or other third party, and Owner need only look to Contractor for corrective 
action. In addition, Contractors warranties shall not be restricted in any 
manner by any warranty of a Subcontractor or other third party, and the 
refusal of a Subcontractor or other third party to provide or honor a 
warranty or to correct defective, deficient or nonconforming Work shall not 
excuse Contractor from its liability on its warranties to Owner. Contractor 
shall have no responsibility to perform any warranty Work with respect to 
Owner Equipment unless any Defect with respect to such Owner Equipment is 
attributable to Contractors failure to comply with the requirements set 
forth in Section 3.1(a)(ii)(B).


13.6 Conditions of Warranty. To the extent that any failure by Contractor 
to meet the foregoing warranties is the result of (a) Owners failure to 
receive, handle, store, maintain, or install the Equipment furnished in a 
reasonable manner or in accordance with any reasonable Contractor 
requirements conveyed to Owner, (b) Owners failure to operate the 
Equipment within its rating or operated and maintained in a reasonable 
manner consistent with Contractors or Equipment vendors instructions, (c) 
Owner subjecting the Equipment to abuse or misuse, or (d) normal wear and 
tear or corrosion inherent in the operation of the Facility, then, to that 
extent, Contractor shall be excused for said failure.
 
50

------------------------------------------------------------------------
13.7 Title Warranty. Contractor represents and warrants that it shall 
provide to, and, effective as of the applicable date set forth in Section 
22.1, hereby assigns and transfers to, Owner good, marketable and exclusive 
title to the Equipment, free and clear of all Liens (other than Liens 
created solely by the actions of Owner); provided, however, that Contractor 
shall not be required to assign and transfer to Owner good, marketable and 
exclusive title to certain intellectual property to be licensed to Owner as 
provided in Article 19, but Contractor shall, and hereby does, grant, 
effective upon the date on which Owner takes over care, custody and control 
of the Facility, to Owner the licenses to such intellectual property as 
described in Article 19. In the event of any nonconformity with or breach 
of this warranty, Contractor shall, as part of the Fixed Prices, promptly, 
and in any event within thirty (30) Days thereof, remove any Lien on any of 
such Equipment or otherwise provide Owner good, marketable and exclusive 
title to such Equipment, free and clear of all Liens; provided, that if 
Contractor is unable within such thirty (30) Day period to remove such 
Lien, Contractor may post a bond in an amount (and otherwise in form and 
substance) reasonably acceptable to Owner so long as Contractor continues 
to use all commercially reasonable efforts to remove such Lien as promptly 
as practicable. This Section shall survive the expiration, cancellation or 
termination of this Agreement.


13.8 Intellectual Property Warranty. Contactor warrants that the Services 
performed by Contractor or its Subcontractors, the Equipment and the 
Documentation, or any part of any of the foregoing, shall not infringe or 
constitute a misappropriation of any right of any third party, including, 
without limitation, any copyrights, mask work rights, patent rights, 
trademark rights, trade secret rights or confidentiality rights.


13.9 Warranty Assistance. During the Warranty Periods, Owner shall, without 
cost to Contractor: (a) provide Contractor reasonable working access 
(subject to such restrictions and conditions as Owner may have instituted 
generally for its contractors) to the Site to remove, disassemble, replace 
and reinstall any Equipment with respect to which a Defect exists; (b) 
remove, to the extent erected by Owner or a third party and not included 
in, or required by, the Specifications and to the extent necessary to 
permit Contractor to perform its warranty obligations, any material or 
structures; and (c) provide Contractor reasonable access to Facility 
personnel as are reasonably necessary to the extent consistent with 
personnel job classifications and subject to availability to assist 
Contractor in the performance of its warranty obligations.


13.10 Exclusive Warranties. THE WARRANTIES SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT ARE 
EXCLUSIVE AND ARE IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER WARRANTIES WHETHER STATUTORY, 
EXPRESS, OR IMPLIED (INCLUDING ALL WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND 
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND ALL WARRANTIES ARISING FROM COURSE OF 
DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE). Correction of Defects in the manner and within 
the period of time provided herein shall constitute complete fulfillment of 
all the liabilities of Contractor with respect to such Defect, whether the 
claims by Owner are based in contract, in tort (including negligence and 
strict liability), or otherwise.
 
51

------------------------------------------------------------------------
14. 	INDEMNIFICATION

14.1 Contractors Indemnity. Contractor shall indemnify and hold harmless 
Owner, its parents and Affiliates, and their respective partners, 
shareholders, members, agents, employees, officers, directors, and lenders

costs and expenses associated therewith (including attorneys fees and 
other professionals fees) for any injury of or death to persons, damage to 
or destruction of third party property, contamination of the environment or 
injury to natural resources, whether contractual, in tort, or as a matter 
of strict liability or liability imposed by Law, to the extent any of the 
foregoing arise out of the negligence or willful misconduct or wanton acts 
or omissions of Contractor, any Subcontractor or any of their respective 
employees, agents or third parties over which either has reasonable control 
during the performance of the Services, including any Services during any 
Warranty Period, and

(ii) any and all claims, demands or causes of action of every kind and 
character by any Person and all damages, liabilities, losses, costs and 
expenses associated therewith (including attorneys fees and other 
professionals fees) for:

Subcontractor or any of their respective employees, agents or third parties 
over which either has reasonable control;
 
  	(b) 	any action taken by Contractor, any Subcontractor or any of their 
respective employees, agents or third parties over which either has 
reasonable control, which action results directly in Owner violating any 
Law; or
 
  	(c) 	any prohibited assignment by Contractor of this Agreement.


14.2 Owners Indemnity. Owner shall indemnify and hold harmless Contractor, 
its parents and Affiliates and their respective partners, shareholders, 
members, agents, employees, officers, directors, and lenders (collectively,

other professionals fees) for any injury of or death to persons, damage to 
or destruction of third party property, contamination of the environment or 
injury to natural resources, whether contractual, in tort, or as a matter 
of strict liability or liability imposed by Law, to the extent any of the 
foregoing arise out of, in whole or in part, the negligence or willful 
misconduct or wanton acts or omissions of Owner or any of its employees, 
agents or third parties over which it has reasonable control during the 
performance of the Services, including any Services during any Warranty 
Period; and
 
52

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(ii) any and all claims, demands or causes of action of every kind and 
character by any Person and all damages, liabilities, losses, costs and 
expenses associated therewith (including attorneys fees and other 
professionals fees) for:
 
  	(a) 	any violation or alleged violation of Laws by Owner, its employees 
or agents or third parties over which it has control (unless directly 
caused by Contractor, any Subcontractor, or any of their respective 
employees or agents or third parties over which either of them has 
control), or
 
  	(b) 	any prohibited assignment of this Agreement by Owner, or
 
  	(c) 	any pre-existing Hazardous Materials.


14.3 Intellectual Property Indemnity. Contractor shall, as part of the 
Fixed Prices, defend, indemnify and hold harmless Owner Indemnitees against 
any and all damages, liabilities, losses, costs and expenses (including 
attorneys fees and other professionals fees) associated with any claims, 
suits or proceedings brought against any of the Owner Indemnitees based on 
an allegation that any Services performed by Contractor or its 
Subcontractors, the Documentation or the Equipment, or any part thereof, or 
use thereof, constitutes an infringement or misappropriation of any right 
of any third party, including, without limitation, any copyrights, mask 
work rights, United States patent rights, trademark rights, trade secret 
rights, confidentiality rights or other property rights, if Contractor is 
notified promptly in writing and given authority, information, and 
assistance for the defense or settlement of such claim suit or proceeding. 
Contractor will not be responsible for any settlement of such suit or 
proceeding made without its written consent. Contractor shall obtain 
Owners written consent, which may be withheld in Owners sole discretion, 
prior to entering into any settlement of any such claim suit or proceeding 
that does not include a complete liability release for all Owner 
Indemnitees or that would prohibit use of any part of the Project, the 
Documentation or the Equipment by any Owner Indemnitees. If the use of the 
Project, the Documentation or the Equipment, or any part thereof, as a 
result of any such claim, suit or proceeding is held to constitute 
infringement, and its use by any of the Owner Indemnitees is enjoined, 
Contractor shall, at its option, either: (i) procure for such Owner 
Indemnitees the right to continue using the Project, the Documentation or 
the Equipment, or any part thereof; (ii) replace same with substantially 
equivalent non-infringing Documentation or Equipment or parts thereof 
acceptable to Owner; or (iii) modify same in a manner acceptable to Owner 
and in conformance with the functional requirements of this Agreement so it 
becomes non-infringing. Except to the extent that Contractor is a 
contributory infringer, Contractor shall have no indemnity duty or 
obligation hereunder to the extent that the Facility, the Documentation or 
the Equipment furnished hereunder is (A) modified by Owner after acceptance 
thereof to make it infringing, or (B) combined by Owner with items not 
furnished hereunder or recommended or approved by Contractor and solely as 
a result of said modification or combination a claim, suit or proceeding is 
brought against Owner. Contractor shall flow down the requirements of this 
Section 14.3 and make Owner direct beneficiary of the indemnification 
obligation in its subcontracts with all Major Subcontractors. If Contractor 
is unable to flow down such provision to a Major Subcontractor, Contractor 
shall notify Owner in writing of such failure prior to entering into a 
subcontract with such Person and Owner and Contractor shall consult in good 
faith concerning the options to select an alternative Subcontractor. 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Contractors obligations under 
this Section 14.3 shall not apply to the Owner Equipment.

of the existence of such Third Party Claim and must deliver copies of any 
documents served on the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Party 
Claim; provided, however, that any failure to notify the indemnifying Party 
or deliver such copies will not relieve the indemnifying Party from any 
obligation hereunder unless (and then solely to the extent that) the 
indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such failure.

(b) The indemnifying Party shall have the right to conduct and control, 
through counsel of its own choosing, reasonably acceptable to the 
Indemnified Party, any Third Party Claim; provided, however, that (i) if

Party that the indemnifying Party will have the financial resources to 
defend against the Third Party Claim and fulfill its indemnification 
obligations hereunder, (ii) the Indemnified Party may, at its election, 
participate in the defense thereof at its sole cost and expense and (iii)

assume the defense of such Third Party Claim and forego any indemnity 
claimed under this Article, (C) in the reasonable opinion of legal counsel 
for the Indemnified Party, such Third Party Claim involves the potential 
imposition of criminal liability on the Indemnified Party, its directors, 
officers, employees or agents, (D) in the reasonable opinion of legal 
counsel for the Indemnified Party, the Third Party Claim involves, or is 
likely to involve, any claim by any Government Authority or (E) in the

indemnified Party. The indemnifying Party may, in any event, participate in 
such proceedings at its own cost and expense.

(c) The indemnifying Party, in the defense of any such litigation, other 
proceeding or other claim, shall have the right in its sole discretion to

Party and its Affiliates, (ii) there is no finding or admission of any 
violation of Law, and (iii) the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates will 
have no liability with respect to such compromise or settlement. Otherwise, 
no such Third Party Claim shall be settled or agreed to without the prior 
written consent of the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party and the 
indemnifying Party shall fully cooperate in good faith in connection with 
such defense and shall cause their legal counsel, accountants and

assistance as the other Party may reasonably require in connection with 
such defense, including making employees of the Indemnified Party available 
to testify and assist others in testifying in any such proceedings.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
15. 	INSURANCE

Prior to the Price Finalization Deadline, Owner and Contractor shall 
evaluate the two insurance alternatives A-1 and A-2 and Owner shall 
include one of the two alternatives or a mutually agreeable hybrid of the 
two alternatives.


15.1 Owner Provided Builders Risk.

(a) The Owner shall procure and maintain Builders Risk Insurance Coverage 
which provides for All Risk coverage for physical loss or damage to the 
Work from the date the first Full Notice to Proceed is issued hereunder 
until the latest of the Substantial Completion Dates of Unit 6 and the Unit 
5 Scrubber, including physical loss or damage resulting from earthquake, 
flood and hot testing. Such coverage shall encompass the buildings, 
structure of work, materials and property associated with the Work in the 
care, custody or control of Contractor and the enrolled Subcontractors at 
the Site. Such coverage shall include coverage for earthquake, subsidence 
and sinkhole, water damage (including flood), windstorms, boiler, 
machinery, inland transit and temporary off-Site storage exposure, start-up 
and testing coverage, vandalism, malicious mischief, collapse, falsework, 
temporary buildings, debris removal including demolition occasioned by 
enforcement of applicable legal requirements.

(b) The Builders Risk coverage provided by Owner shall in no way be 
construed to provide coverage for the tools, materials, and equipment of 
Contractor or any Subcontractor. The Builders Risk policy does not provide 
coverage for Contractors or any Subcontractors equipment, including 
owned, used and leased equipment required to perform the Work. Furthermore, 
the Builders Risk policy does not provide business interruption or delay 
in completion coverage for Contractor or any Subcontractor.

deductibles up to *** for all other real property and tangible personal 
property (except up to *** for start-up and testing of all Equipment) at 
the Site. ***.

(e) Owner shall, and shall cause its underwriters to, waive subrogation 
against Contractor (including its Affiliates) and its Subcontractors on 
such Builders Risk insurance policy except for any claims or matters in 
which the Equipment warranty or the Services warranty provided by 
Contractor or any Subcontractor hereunder are involved. It is further 
agreed that Owner may elect to self-insure this risk. In the event that 
Owner elects to self-insure the Builders Risk, Owner shall waive its right 
to recover the cost to repair or replace such loss or damage from 
Contractor (including its Affiliates) and its Subcontractors in excess of 
the deductible or retention amount and to the extent that coverage would 
have been available had Owner obtained the foregoing Builders Risk 
insurance policy. Should a loss be sustained at the Site and in the course 
of construction to property that is to be incorporated into the Project, 
Contractor shall replace or repair such loss or damage in accordance with 
the terms of this Agreement, and Contractor shall be reimbursed for all 
such costs plus the cost of extended overhead (including for home

act on behalf of Owner, at Owners request, for the purpose of adjusting 
any loss to Owners Equipment.

delivered to Owner within thirty (30) Days of the Effective Date, within 
ten (10) Days of each policy renewal or change and from time to time 
thereafter, as may be requested by Owner. All policies shall include

Owner and its successors and assigns (including the Financial Institutions) 
using standard ISO forms or equivalent. The existence of any self-insured 
retentions (SIRS) over which the required policies apply must be disclosed 
to and approved by Owner. Contractor shall provide copies of CCIP placement 
and renewal policies and all endorsements to the Owner not later than sixty 
(60) Days following placement or renewal.

(b) Contractor shall comply with the conditions stipulated in each of the 
insurance policies. None of the insurance coverage required hereunder shall

provisions for excluding Subcontractors must be disclosed and approved by 
Owner in writing prior to CCIP effective date.

(c) If any of the insurance required under this Article (other than 
project-specific insurance) shall be directly or indirectly depleted by *** 
or more (whether due to payment of insurance proceeds, creation of a 
reserve or otherwise), Contractor shall obtain from the insurer a 
reinstatement option, if commercially available at a cost comparable to the 
original policy cost, to each such policy at least equal to the depleted 
amount. Owner shall bear the cost of such option (including the cost 
associated with the reinstatement). Contractor shall cause such insurer to 
send to Owner a notice of such reinstatement and a copy of the reinstated 
policy related thereto upon Owner exercising and payment for the 
reinstatement.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
policies reasonably necessary to perform such Service with adequate 
coverages and in such amounts in accordance with Contractors normal 
practices and consistent with Good Industry Practices, and provide Owner 
with evidence acceptable to Owner of such coverage, or Contractor shall 
maintain such coverage under its own insurance policies or CCIP. Contractor 
shall ensure that all Subcontractors obtain and maintain prudent insurance 
coverages. All Subcontractor coverages shall waive subrogation rights 
against Owner and Contractor, and shall name Owner, Contractor and all 
covered Subcontractors as additional insured (except Workers Compensation 
and Professional Liability).

(f) Any certificates of renewal with respect to any insurance policy 
required to be maintained by Contractor hereunder shall be delivered to 
Owner promptly after renewal. Contractor shall insure that the insurer 
shall submit a copy of all receipts for premiums paid to Owner promptly 
after payment of such premiums. Contractor shall be solely responsible for 
the timely payment in full of premiums for all insurance required of it 
hereunder. Should Contractor fail to provide or maintain any insurance 
required hereunder, Owner shall have the right, but not the obligation, to 
provide or maintain any such insurance, and to deduct the cost thereof from 
any amounts due and payable to Contractor, or, in the event there are no 
such amounts due and payable, Contractor shall reimburse Owner for such 
costs on demand. Contractor shall not unreasonably refuse to cooperate or 
to take any actions requested or necessary to prosecute any claims under 
any insurance policy required to be maintained by Contractor hereunder.

Completion of each Unit 6 and the Unit 5 Scrubber, Contractor shall, upon 
request of Owner, cause Guarantor to deliver to Owner (a) within *** Days 
following the end of each fiscal year, a copy of Guarantors annual report 
(or, if there is no such report, a copy of such report for its parent 
company) containing audited, consolidated financial statements for such 
fiscal year, and (b) within *** Days after the end of each of its first 
three fiscal quarters of each fiscal year, a copy of Guarantors quarterly 
report (or, if there is no such report, a copy of such report for its 
parent company) containing unaudited consolidated financial statements for 
such fiscal quarter. In all cases, the statements shall be prepared in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. To the extent 
such quarterly reports are not available, upon the reasonable request of 
Owner in response to a credit event in the marketplace, Guarantor shall 
provide unaudited management financial information for such fiscal quarter.
 
65

------------------------------------------------------------------------
16.2 Standby Letter of Credit.

(i) Upon the Effective Date, Contractor shall obtain and provide to Owner 
an irrevocable standby letter of credit in an initial amount equal to $*** 
in favor of Owner in the form attached as Exhibit J-2 (as the same may be 
amended or replaced from time to time in accordance with this Section 16.2
, the Standby Letter of Credit). The Standby Letter of Credit shall be 
issued by a U.S. commercial bank or a foreign bank with a U.S. branch with 
total assets of at least $5 billion having a general long-term senior 
unsecured debt rating of A - or higher (as rated by Standard & Poors 
Rating Group) or A3 or higher (as rated by Moodys Investor Services, Inc.) 
and shall permit presentation at a bank located in Charlotte, NC, Atlanta, 
GA, or New York, NY. If at any time the Standby Letter of Credit fails to 
meet the foregoing conditions, Contractor shall replace the outstanding 
Standby Letter of Credit with a Standby Letter of Credit that meets the 
foregoing conditions. Contractor shall ensure that the Standby Letter of 
Credit shall be renewed or replaced on an annual basis and shall remain in 
full force and outstanding until the expiration of the Warranty Period, as 
such period may be extended pursuant to Section 13.3. If Contractor fails 
to renew or replace the Standby Letter of Credit at least thirty (30) Days 
prior to the expiration thereof, then, in the sole and absolute discretion 
of Owner, Owner shall be entitled to draw and retain until the end of the 
Warranty Period the full amount of such Standby Letter of Credit. Such 
retained amount, less any amount offset against such retained amount for 
claims, shall be returned to Contractor promptly upon expiration of the 
Warranty Period.

(ii) Contractor shall cause such Standby Letter of Credit to be amended or 
replaced as of each date set forth in the Letter of Credit Value Chart 
attached as Exhibit J-3 (the Letter of Credit Value Chart) so that the 
amount of such amended or replacement Standby Letter of Credit is revised 
to be equal to the amount set forth in the Letter of Credit Value Chart 
attached as Exhibit J-3. In the event of a Force Majuere or any other delay 
in completion of a payment Milestone in the Schedule, including a delay 
which results in a revision to the Cash Flow Plan or any component thereof, 
or in the event of a Change Order (or series of Change Orders) that 
increases or decreases, cumulatively, the Contract Price by more than ***, 
Owner, in its reasonable discretion, shall be entitled to make an equitable 
adjustment to the Letter of Credit Value Chart to take into account such 
event, in which case Contractor shall amend, replace or supplement the 
then-outstanding Standby Letter of Credit to reflect the adjustment made to 
the Letter of Credit Value Chart. Owner shall not be obligated to make 
further Invoice payments, approve any such Change Order or modify the 
Schedule until Contractor shall have provided Owner with such amended, 
replacement or supplemental Standby Letter of Credit.

(iii) Contractor shall invoice Owner on a quarterly basis for the fees 
charged by the issuing financial institution for the issuance of the 
Standby Letter of Credit (including any amendment or replacement thereto) 
from the Effective Date through the Warranty Period, but without any 
administrative charges or Contractor profit added to such financial 
institution fees. For any equitable increase to the Letter of Credit Value 
Chart after the Effective Date, Owner shall pay the then-current fees 
charged by the issuing institution for such amendment, replacement or 
supplement. Contractor shall provide such documentation and materials as 
Owner may reasonably require to substantiate the Letter of Credit fees 
(including the fees for any amendment, replacement or supplement thereto).

respect to the Financial Institutions and their consultants and 
representatives, including developing and providing information regarding 
the Project (if available to Contractor) and this Agreement. Contractor 
shall provide the Financial Institutions with reasonable access to, and

the purposes of inspecting the Equipment and the Owner Equipment, provided 
that any such inspection does not unreasonably interfere with or delay 
Contractors performance of the Services and (C) such access to 
documentation in relation to this Agreement or the Work at such times as 
Owner shall reasonably request. For any additional time required by any 
Financial Institution to cure any defaults of Owner hereunder, which 
defaults interfere in Contractors ability to perform the Services, 
Contractor shall be entitled to an equitable adjustment in the Schedule in 
accordance with Article 8.

(b) Contractor hereby consents to the collateral assignment of this 
Agreement to the Financial Institutions. Contractor also shall enter into a 
consent to assignment with the Financial Institutions regarding this 
Agreement which shall contain provisions that are typically provided to 
financial institutions in similar project financing, including the right to 
render and receive performance under this Agreement, and giving the 
Financial Institutions copies of notices delivered to Owner under this 
Agreement. Owner will be entitled to assign, and Contractor shall ensure 
that the relevant instruments permit the assignment of, the benefit of any 
parental guarantee, Standby Letter of Credit or other financial instrument 
at any time to the Financial Institutions without the consent of Contractor 
or the issuer of such parental guarantee, Standby Letter of Credit or other 
financial instrument being required.

proper storage, transportation and disposal. All activities performed by 
Contractor in connection with the handling, collection and containerizing

provided in this Agreement, good, exclusive and marketable title, free and 
clear of all Liens (other than Liens created by the non-payment by Owner of 
a Milestone Payment amount which is not the subject of a good faith 
dispute), to the Equipment and to each of the constituent parts thereof 
shall pass to Owner upon the (i) delivery of such Equipment or constituent 
part thereof to the Site and (ii) payment of the amount then due under a 
Invoice covering such Equipment or constituent part of such Equipment, 
notwithstanding any disputed amounts withheld or offset by Owner against 
any payment sought by Contractor in accordance with the terms of this 
Agreement. The passage of title to Owner shall not be deemed an acceptance 
or approval of such Equipment (or any Service), affect the allocation of 
risk of loss, affect any security interest in favor of Owner therein or 
otherwise relieve Contractor of any obligation under this Agreement to 
provide and pay for transportation and storage in connection with the 
Equipment. Further, upon the passage of title, the Equipment, constituent 
parts thereof and the unused spare parts shall be specifically excluded 
from the bankruptcy estate of Contractor in the event of any bankruptcy or 
insolvency proceeding involving Contractor. Regardless of whether title has 
passed to Owner, Contractor hereby grants Owner a continuing security 
interest in all of the Equipment to the extent of the payments made in 
connection therewith, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, wherever 
located and all attachments and accessions thereto and all replacements 
thereof, all drawings, plans and general intangibles related thereto, all 
warranties and contract rights related thereto and all proceeds of the 
foregoing (collectively, the Collateral), to secure all past, present and 
future indebtedness and obligations which Contractor owes Owner under this 
Agreement. Contractor shall cause such security interest to constitute, at 
all times, a valid, enforceable, duly perfected, first priority security 
interest in the Collateral superior to all other claims to and interests in 
the Collateral, including the claims of any lender, vendor or Subcontractor 
to Contractor, it being understood that Owner shall be responsible for 
initial perfection of such security interest. Contractor hereby authorizes 
Owner to file financing statements naming Contractor as debtor with respect 
to the Collateral in such jurisdictions as Owner believes are necessary to 
perfect the foregoing security interest. Contractor shall execute and 
deliver at all times requested by Owner all other instruments and documents 
necessary or desirable to establish, perfect or maintain this security 
interest. At the request of Owner, Contractor shall clearly label the 
Collateral with Owners name for the purpose of proper identification of 
the Collateral.
 
73

------------------------------------------------------------------------
22.2 Risk of Loss. Whether or not title has passed to Owner, the risk of 
loss for all Equipment shall remain with Contractor until, and shall pass 
to Owner upon, Substantial Completion of Unit 6 or Unit 5 Scrubber; 
provided, that risk of loss to Owner Equipment shall not be the 
responsibility of Contractor until furnished to, and accepted by, 
Contractor. To the extent of the proceeds of BAR insurance, Contractor

27.1 Employment Taxes. Neither Owner nor its officers, employees, agents, 
consultants or other representatives shall have any liability for any 
payroll or employment compensation taxes, for Social Security taxes, or for 
labor-related withholding taxes, for Contractor and its Subcontractors 
(including manufacturers); or any of their employees; and Contractor agrees 
to hold Owner, his Consultants, and his other contractors harmless against 
any claim or liability therefore.


27.2 Sales and Use Taxes on Contractor Tools. Contractor shall pay all 
taxes on Contractors purchases of goods, tools, equipment, supplies and 
other consumables which are not permanently incorporated into the Project 
and which remain the property of Contractor. Contractor shall also pay all 
taxes attributable to Contractors construction equipment, temporary 
buildings and other property used by Contractor in its performance of this 
Agreement. Allowance for such taxes is included in the Contract Price, and 
Contractor shall pay those taxes when assessed, without claim against Owner 
for reimbursement. Contractor shall impose a similar obligation on all 
Subcontractors and shall ensure that no Subcontractor shall have any claim 
against Owner for reimbursement of those taxes.


27.3 Sales and Use Tax on Equipment; Privilege Tax. Notwithstanding the 
above, the Contract Price does not include monies for the payment of any 
sales and use taxes on Equipment incorporated into the Facility. 
Contractor, on behalf of itself and all of its Subcontractors
 
84

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(including manufacturers), is therefore responsible for consulting with 
Owner on Equipment purchases and working with Owner to obtain the 
appropriate sales and use tax and privilege tax benefits for Owner. Owner 
is currently authorized under the North Carolina General Statutes to 
purchase certain Equipment exempt from the sales and use tax, but subject 
to the privilege tax at a rate of 1% with a maximum tax of eighty dollars 
($80) per article. Owner will specifically identify property which will be 
subject to the privilege tax. Owner will issue Form E-595E to Contractor to 
support the exemption from the sales and use tax. Contractor shall register 
with the state of North Carolina for payment of the privilege tax. 
Contractor will issue Form E-595E to its suppliers to facilitate exempt 
purchases of property subject to the privilege tax. As required by law, 
Contractor will accrue the privilege tax on these purchases and remit the 
appropriate amount to the State. Sales tax should be billed by the supplier 
on Contractors purchases of property subject to the North Carolina sales 
tax.

(a) Contractor, its Subcontractors, manufacturers and suppliers shall make 
reasonable commercial efforts to purchase Equipment to minimize the tax, 
but shall not be restricted from making out-of-state purchases of such 
Equipment. Contractor shall use its best efforts to ensure that Owner is 
afforded the appropriate sales/use and privilege tax treatment by the State 
of North Carolina. Contractor shall use all reasonable efforts to ensure 
that all out-of-state purchases made by Contractor and its Subcontractors 
(including manufacturers) are shipped FOB the Facility (North Carolina) 
free of Sales Taxes. Owner shall reimburse Contractor for all sales and use 
taxes and privilege taxes paid by Contractor and its Subcontractors 
(including manufacturers) upon written confirmation from Contractor that 
the items purchased could not reasonably be purchased free of Sales Taxes.

(b) Contractor agrees that it and its Subcontractors, suppliers, and 
manufacturers will clearly identify on each original invoice covering the 
purchase of Equipment, the amount of sales and use tax. Should additional 
information and detail be required by Owner and the North Carolina 
Department of Revenue to verify amounts paid for purchases of Equipment 
under this Agreement, Contractor and its Subcontractors, suppliers, and 
manufacturers shall supply such additional information and invoices in 
sufficient detail to verify:

(i) That such Goods were purchased free of State sales and use taxes; or 
that for out-of-state purchases, the invoices indicate the amount of 
foreign sales and use tax separately stated and paid;

(ii) The privilege tax was accrued and remitted to North Carolina for such 
Equipment;

(iii) The actual purchase prices of such Equipment;

(iv) The date of delivery to the Site of such Equipment;

(v) A description of the function of such Equipment; and

(vi) The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Code identification 
for such Equipment.
 
85

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(c) As a condition to Final Completion of Unit 6 or the Unit 5 Scrubber, 
Contractor shall provide Owner with an affidavit that all invoices which 
include sales and use taxes or privilege tax have been paid and that 
Contractor and all its Subcontractors, suppliers, and manufacturers have no 
outstanding claims or expenses relating to sales and use tax or privilege 
tax.

(d) Both Parties shall provide to the other any documentation or 
information requested in order to submit and obtain a refund of any taxes 
erroneously paid as part of this Agreement. The Parties agree that any 
refunds received shall belong to the Party which bore the economic burden 
of paying the tax. The Parties obligations under this Section shall 
survive termination or expiration of the Agreement.


27.4 State Property Taxes. Contractor and Owner agree that Owner shall be 
responsible for the filing requirements and payment obligations for all 
state and local taxes on the Site and the Equipment incorporated into the 
Facility; provided, that Contractor shall be responsible for the filing of 
property tax returns and the payment of State and local property taxes on 
construction equipment, tools and material which is not incorporated into 
the Project and which is owned, used or leased by Contractor to perform the 
Services. Owner and Contractor acknowledge that construction equipment 
property tax costs are included in the leasing costs included in the Fixed 
Prices. If Contractor owns construction equipment and leases such 
construction equipment to Owner, Contractor shall remain responsible for 
the filing and payment of all property taxes due on such construction 
equipment.


27.5 Tax Indemnification.

(a) Except in cases where such tax assessment is the result of the 
negligence or willful or wanton misconduct by Contractor, Owner shall 
defend, reimburse, indemnify and hold Contractor harmless for all costs and 
expenses incurred by Contractor as a result of Owners formal protest of 
any sales and use taxes paid or assessed and property taxes paid or 
assessed on the Site or the Equipment, or any other similar tax, whether 
local, state or federal, including any litigation expenses in the event 
Owner decides to protest a sales or use tax assessment. Owner shall not be 
responsible for any costs incurred by Contractor necessary to substantiate 
or verify information for any tax audit conducted in the normal course of 
business.

(b) Contractor shall defend, reimburse, indemnify and hold Owner harmless 
for all costs and expenses incurred by Owner as a result of Contractors 
formal protest of any Employment Taxes, or any sales and use taxes and 
property taxes paid or assessed on Contractors equipment or tools, or of 
any payroll or employment compensation taxes, or Social Security taxes, or 
for labor-related withholding taxes, or any other similar tax, whether 
local, state or federal for Contractor; its Subcontractors (including 
manufacturers); or any of their employees, paid or assessed, including any 
litigation expenses in the event Contractor decides to protest the said 
employment, withholding, and similar taxes.


27.6 Pollution Control Equipment Information. Contractor shall supply Owner 
with all reasonable information and cost analyses requested by Owner for 
qualifying air, water or noise pollution control equipment for exemption 
from sales and use taxes, property taxes and any other
 
86

------------------------------------------------------------------------
tax credits, refunds or exemptions available to Owner. Contractor shall 
supply any further information as requested by Owner to apply for a 
certificate from the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural 
Resources (DNHR) or other appropriate Government Authority to qualify for 
the above exemptions.
 
28. 	DISPUTE RESOLUTION

28.1 Resolution by the Parties: Mediation. The Parties shall attempt to 
resolve any claims, disputes and other controversies arising out of or 
relating to this Agreement (collectively, Disputes) promptly by 
negotiation and mediation between executives who have authority to settle 
the Dispute and who are at a higher level of management than the persons 
with direct responsibility for administration of this Agreement. A Party 
may give the other Party written notice of a Dispute which has not been 
resolved in the normal course of business. Such notice shall include: (a) a 
statement of that Partys position and a summary of arguments supporting 
such position, and (b) the name and title of the executive who will be 
representing that Party and of any other person who will accompany the 
executive. Within five (5) Days after delivery of the notice, the receiving 
Party shall respond with (i) a statement of that Partys position and a 
summary of arguments supporting such position, and (ii) the name and title 
of the executive who will represent that Party and of any other person who 
will accompany the executive. Within ten (10) Days after delivery of the 
summary positions, the Parties shall select a mutually agreeable neutral 
mediator and the executives of both Parties shall meet with the mediator at 
a mutually acceptable time and place, and shall meet thereafter as often as 
they reasonably deem necessary, to attempt to resolve the Dispute. All 
negotiations pursuant to this clause are to be deemed confidential and 
shall be treated as compromise and settlement negotiations for purposes of 
applicable rules of evidence.


28.2 Arbitration Proceedings.

(a) Demand for Arbitration. If the Dispute has not been resolved by 
negotiation within *** Days of the disputing Partys initial notice (or 
such longer period as the Parties may reasonably agree), or if the Parties 
failed to meet for the first time within *** Days of the initial notice, 
the Parties shall fully and finally settle the Dispute by binding 
arbitration. All arbitration proceedings shall take place in Charlotte, 
North Carolina under the auspices of the American Arbitration Association (
AAA) in accordance with the AAA Construction Industry Arbitration Rules 
then in effect, and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 
U.S.C. §§ 1-16. For all Disputes where the amount in controversy is less 
than ***, the arbitration proceedings shall be conducted by a *** selected 
by the Parties (or by the AAA, if the Parties cannot agree on an arbitrator 
within *** Days following the delivery of a demand for arbitration to the 
other Party). For all Disputes where the amount in controversy is equal to 
or more than ***, the arbitration proceedings shall be conducted by a ***. 
If the Parties have not agreed on the selection of *** on or before *** 
Days following the delivery of a demand for arbitration to the other Party, 
then each Party, by notice to the other Party, may designate *** (who shall 
not be a current or former officer, director, employee or agent of such 
Party or any of its Affiliates). The *** designated by the Parties shall 
endeavor to designate promptly a ***. If either Party fails to designate an 
initial *** on or before *** Days following the delivery
 
87

------------------------------------------------------------------------
of an arbitration notice to the other Party, or if the *** have not 
designated *** within *** Days of the date for designation of the *** 
initially designated, either Party may request that the AAA designate the 
remaining *** pursuant to its Construction Industry Arbitration Rules. If 
any arbitrator resigns, becomes incapacitated, or otherwise refuses or 
fails to serve or to continue to serve as an arbitrator, then the Party 
entitled to designate that arbitrator shall designate a successor. The 
demand for arbitration shall be served on the other Party to this 
Agreement. No demand for arbitration shall be made or permitted after the 
date when the institution of a civil action based on the Dispute would be 
barred by the applicable statute of limitations or repose of the State.

(b) Consolidation. No arbitration arising under this Agreement shall 
include, by consolidation, joinder or any other manner, any Person not a 
Party to this Agreement unless (i) such Person is substantially involved in 
a common question of fact or Laws, (ii) the presence of the Person is 
required if complete relief is to be accorded in the arbitration, and (iii) 
the Person has consented to be included.

(c) Equitable Remedies. The procedures specified in this Article shall be 
the sole and exclusive procedures for the resolution of Disputes between 
the Parties arising out of or relating to this Agreement; provided, 
however, that a Party may file a complaint in a court of competent 
jurisdiction on issues of statute of limitations or repose or to seek 
injunctive relief, sequestration, garnishment, attachment, or an 
appointment of a receiver. Preservation of these remedies does not limit 
the power of the arbitrator(s) to grant similar remedies, and despite such 
actions, the Parties will continue to participate in good faith in and be 
bound by the dispute resolution procedures specified in this Article.

(d) Award; Binding Nature. The arbitrator(s) decision shall be by majority 
vote and shall be issued in a writing that sets forth in separately 
numbered paragraphs all of the findings of fact and conclusions of law 
necessary for the decision. Findings of fact and conclusions of law shall 
be separately designated as such. The arbitrator(s) shall not be entitled 
to deviate from the construct, procedures or requirements of this 
Agreement. In the absence of bias, fraud, or willful misconduct by an 
arbitrator, any decision rendered by the arbitrator(s) in any arbitration 
shall be final and binding upon the Parties, and judgment may be entered on 
the award in any court of competent jurisdiction. The cost of all 
arbitrators shall be borne equally by the Parties.

(e) Discovery. Either Party may apply to the arbitrators for the privilege 
of conducting discovery. The right to conduct discovery shall be granted by 
the arbitrators in their sole discretion with a view to avoiding surprise 
and providing reasonable access to necessary information or to information 
likely to be presented during the course of the arbitration.


28.3 Continuation of Work. Pending the final resolution of any Dispute, 
Contractor shall proceed diligently with the performance or provision of 
the Work and its other duties and obligations and Owner shall continue to 
compensate Contractor as set forth under this Agreement without diminution 
of effort, including payment to Contractor provisionally on a time and 
material basis for all disputed work.

substantially all of the assets of Contractor and whose market 
capitalization exceeds *** and whose long term senior unsecured, uninsured 
debt is rated at least Baa3 by Moodys or BBB- by Standard & Poors at the

State of North Carolina but without relieving Contractor from its 
obligations hereunder. Owner, including any Party constituting Owner, may 
assign this Agreement or any benefit, interest, right or cause of action 
arising under this Agreement to any Person with notice to, but without the 
consent of, Contractor under the following circumstances: (a) the assignee

assignment is being made and the assignees senior unsecured debt has a 
credit rating of S&P BBB-, Moodys Baa3, or (c) such assignee is otherwise 
reasonably acceptable to Contractor. Owner (or the assigning Party that 
constitutes a part of Owner, as applicable) shall obtain written assurances 
from the assignee of limitation of and protection against liability 
following the proposed transfer at least equivalent to that afforded 
Contractor and Subcontractors hereunder. Any transfer contrary to this 
Section shall make the assigning Party constituting Owner the indemnitor of 
Contractor against any liabilities incurred in excess of those that would 
have been incurred had no such transfer taken place.


29.4 No Third Party Beneficiaries. Except as expressly set forth in this 
Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement are intended for the sole 
benefit of Owner and Contractor, and there are no third party 
beneficiaries.


29.5 Rights Exclusive. The rights and remedies of Owner or Contractor as 
set forth in this Agreement shall be the exclusive rights or remedies of 
the Parties.


29.6 No Waiver. No course of dealing or failure of Owner or Contractor to 
enforce strictly any term, right or condition of this Agreement shall be 
construed as a waiver of that term,
 
89

------------------------------------------------------------------------
right or condition. No express waiver of any term, right or condition of 
this Agreement shall operate as a waiver of any other term, right or 
condition.

Liability), Article 19 (Intellectual Property), Article 20 
(Confidentiality), Article 27 (Taxes), Article 28 (Dispute Resolution),

29.8 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement or the application of 
this Agreement to any Person or circumstance shall to any extent be held 
invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction or 
arbitrators under Article 28, then (i) the remainder of this Agreement and 
the application of that provision to Persons or circumstances other than 
those as to which it is specifically held invalid or unenforceable shall 
not be affected, and every remaining provision of this Agreement shall be 
valid and binding to the fullest extent permitted by Laws, and (ii) a 
suitable and equitable provision shall be substituted for such invalid or 
unenforceable provision in order to carry out, so far as may be valid and 
enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or unenforceable 
provision.

and equipment which the Contractor will have on site to execute the project 
work. The Contractor will be permitted to work inside the Station fencing 
for construction activities as required. Access will be granted on an as 
needed basis. The Contractor shall be held accountable for controlling 
access through the projects gates while they are being used for either 
employee or material movement. The Contractor shall permit Station 
employees access into the construction areas to commission, operate, and 
maintain equipment as necessary.

THIS GUARANTY is given this 11th day of July, 2007 by *** (Guarantor), 
for the benefit of DUKE ENERGY CAROLINAS, LLC, a limited liability company 
organized under the laws of the State of North Carolina (Owner).



WITNESSETH:


WHEREAS, Owner plans to have constructed a new nominally-rated 800 MW 
supercritical generating Unit 6 and a new flue gas desulfurization system 
on the existing Unit 5 at its electric generating facility known as 
Cliffside Steam Station (the Project); and


WHEREAS, Owner has entered into a Engineering, Procurement and Construction 
Agreement dated July 11, 2007 (the Contract) with Stone and Webster 
National Engineering P.C. (Contractor), whereby Contractor will provide 
certain services for the Project; and


WHEREAS, as a condition to Owner entering into the Contract with 
Contractor, Guarantor must guaranty the obligations of Contractor under the 
Contract in accordance with the terms set forth herein; and


NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and other good 
and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby 
acknowledged, Guarantor hereby agrees as follows:

1. GUARANTEE. Guarantor absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably 
guarantees to Owner that:

(a) if for any reason Contractor shall fail to make proper payment to Owner 
of any amounts from time to time due and payable by Contractor under the 
Contract, including, but not limited to, the payment of damages, Guarantor 
will pay to Owner such amount not paid by Contractor. Guarantor will make 
such payment within thirty (30) days of having received from Owner written 
notice of such failure and a demand for payment, such payment being the 
same as would have been received by Owner had such amount been duly paid by 
Contractor in accordance with the terms of the Contract.


(b) if for any reason Contractor shall fail to perform or cause to be 
performed any other duty, obligation, warranty, guarantee or responsibility 
imposed upon Contractor under the Contract, Guarantor will, upon receipt of 
written notice of such failure and demand by Owner, perform or cause to be 
performed such duty, obligation, warranty, guarantee or responsibility in 
accordance with the Contract.


2. UNCONDITIONAL OBLIGATION. This is a guarantee of payment and performance 
and not of collection. The liability of Guarantor under this Guaranty is 
direct, irrevocable and not conditional or contingent upon the pursuit of 
any remedies against Contractor or any other

Exhibit J-1
 
person or entity, nor upon any other recourse available to Owner, its 
successors, endorsees, transferees, or assigns. Guarantor waives any and 
all rights it may now or in the future have under law or in equity to 
require either that an action be brought against Contractor or any other 
person or entity as a condition to proceeding against Guarantor.


3. ABSOLUTE OBLIGATION. The obligations of Guarantor under this Guaranty 
are absolute and without regard to lack of power or authority of Contractor 
to enter into the Contract or any other circumstances which might otherwise

certifiable CEMS (defined in Section 8.3).

If tuning or other adjustments to Unit 6 that may effect emissions occur 
after non-CEMS monitored emission acceptance and prior to Substantial 
and/or Final Completion, the Owner may require re-testing of emission 
compliance of non-CEMS monitored parameters to verify that tuning has not 
violated emission compliance.

Guaranteed Emission Limits and Guaranteed Removal (%) found in Exhibit M 
are Make Right Performance Guarantees.
 
1.2 	Performance Test Program Philosophy

Table L-2 summarizes the Performance Testing and Equipment Verification 
Program. The purpose of the Performance Test and Equipment Verification 
Program is fivefold:


1.2.1 ASME Code Testing
 
  	 	  	

Unit Performance Testing - Confirm that individual Unit 6 *** guarantees 
contained in the Agreement are met, using

------------------------------------------------------------------------
  	
ASME Performance Test Codes listed in Table L-2. If these values are not 
met, to establish the shortfall value for application of remedies or 
damages addressed in the Agreement with the Contractor.
 
  	 	  	

Steam Generator, Steam Turbine and AQCS Testing - Confirm the performance 
guarantees of Owner Equipment, using Performance Test Codes listed in Table 
L-2. If these values are not met, to establish the shortfall value. These 
may be run concurrently with the Unit 6 Performance Test, where 
appropriate.


1.2.2 Non Code Testing
 
  	 	  	

Major Equipment Verification - Report the performance of major equipment, 
using data collected either during Unit 6 Performance Testing or individual 
Equipment Verification Testing. If performance guarantees are not met, to 
establish an estimate of the shortfall value, for possible Code Testing.

 
  	 	  	

Plant Baseline Data - Establish the overall Unit 6 Baseline Performance 
Data for key operating parameters based on a combination of data taken 
during the Unit 6 Performance Test, Steam Generator and Steam Turbine 
Performance Test and DCS collected data.

 
  	 	  	

Emissions Compliance Test and CEMS Certification - Perform emission 
compliance test and certify CEMS in accordance with Cliffside Air Permit 
and referenced regulatory requirements.

 
1.3 	Agreement Authority

The Agreement contains specific information concerning guarantees, results, 
re-testing, schedule, remedies, liquidated damages and warranties, and is 
not addressed in this Performance Testing Exhibit.
 
1.4 	Performance of Owner Equipment

The Contractors *** Performance Guarantees are based on the guaranteed 
performance of the Owner Equipment. Plant performance test results shall be 
corrected for *** shortfalls that are not attributable to ***. It will be 
the Contractors responsibility to test, document and verify any such 
claimed performance shortfall.
 
1.5 	Substantial Completion Testing

The initial Performance Testing is used to satisfy the Minimum Performance 
Guarantee. This Test shall be satisfied by the same methods as the Unit 6 
Performance Test methodology, except where a substitute test method is 
approved by the Owner.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
A substitute test using installed plant permanent instrumentation in lieu 
of calibrated temporary test instrumentation may be approved after Owner 
review. The pricing defined in Exhibit I is based on the Contractor using 
plant permanent instrumentation for the initial Performance Testing to 
satisfy the Minimum Performance Guarantee. Additional temporary high 
accuracy instrumentation will be used by Contractor for purposes of 
verifying compliance with the Guaranteed Performance.

The initial Performance Test may satisfy the requirement of the Performance 
Guarantees if preformed in accordance with Section 6. of this Exhibit.
 
2.0 	TEST RESPONSIBILITY

All testing described in this Exhibit is in Contractors scope of supply.

A Test Contractor approved by the Owner, shall conduct the Unit 6 
Performance Test, Steam Generator and Steam Turbine Performance Test, and 
compile the Plant Baseline Data. The Contractor and the Test Contractor may 
share the responsibility for the Major Equipment Verification as outlined 
in Table L-2.

The Test Contractor shall be responsible for the Performance Test Plan 
(PTP) , test instrumentation including calibration and set up, pre and post 
test uncertainty analysis, conduct of the testing, data acquisition, data 
reduction, post test calculations, and test report for Unit 6 Performance 
Testing, Steam Generator and Steam Turbine Testing, Plant Baseline Data and 
Major Equipment Verification (except where excluded in Table L-2).
 
3.0 	PERFORMANCE TEST PLAN

The Contractor will submit *** days prior to commencement of the 
Performance Test a complete detailed Performance Test Plan (PTP) mutually 
approved by Owner, Test Contractor, Contractor and Owner Equipment 
Contractors. The PTP will constitute an agreement for the Performance 
Testing by the Parties to the test. Differences between the Test Procedures 
or methods contained in/or developed in accordance with the PTP and the 
respective Agreements or established industry test codes are by mutual 
agreement of the Parties to the test, as approved in the PTP.

The PTP form and contents shall specifically meet the requirements of ASME 
PTC 46  1996, Section 3.2 Test Plan, where ASME Code Testing procedures 
are being applied. The actual test methods and corrections for each test 
shall be in accordance with Codes identified in Table L-2.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.0 	TEST UNCERTAINTY

*** tolerances or uncertainties shall be applied to any Performance Test 
results for the satisfaction of Unit 6 Performance Guarantees, or Steam 
Generator or Steam Turbine Tests.

Pre-Test uncertainties (for ASME Code Tests) will be calculated in 
accordance with applicable ASME Codes, and shall not exceed ASME PTC 
requirements for the applicable Code Test. Post test field verifications 
will be performed on instruments measuring parameters where there is no 
redundancy or for which the data is questionable.
 
5.0 	DEGRADATION

Degradation shall be applied to the Unit 6 *** Tests, in accordance with 
Owner Equipment guarantees. An *** test in accordance with *** 
requirements, shall be performed on the steam turbine by the Test 
Contractor as soon as practical after startup, and prior to the ***. 
Degradation attributed to the *** shall be based on enthalpy drop test 
results in accordance with Steam Turbine Generator guarantees.

Corrections to test results due to *** that are attributable to 
Contractors actions shall not be applied. This includes both equipment 
scope and schedule effects.
 
6.0 	PERFORMANCE TESTING  ASME CODE TESTING
 
6.1 	Test Runs and Corrections

Performance Testing involves set-up, testing, measurements and data 
collection, subsequent calculations and corrections. A series of three (3) 
individual Test Runs meeting the Code requirements for duration (no less 
than 2 hours each), shall be performed at the test conditions, which Unit 6 
is subject to at the time of the testing. Test operational and data 
stability requirements set forth in ASME Codes shall be met.

Results of the three (3) Test Runs shall be corrected to Base Performance 
Conditions and averaged for comparison. The Unit 6 Performance Test will be 
compared to the Performance Guarantee values. The Steam Generator and Steam 
Turbine will be corrected to Owner Equipment Contract conditions and 
compared to contract values.

Demonstration of the Steam Generator and Steam Turbine performance will 
require the Test Contractor to perform measurement/correction methodology 
required by the governing ASME PTC.

Contractor shall provide all required ASME PTC 46, PTC 4 and PTC 6 
correction data. At a minimum, raw source data for curves or correction 
curve equations shall be supplied. Curves may be additionally supplied as 
well, but priority of test correction source will be, in order of

------------------------------------------------------------------------
preference; Manufacturer provided source data or curve equations, best fit 
equations of Manufacturer provided data or curves, visual reads of 
Manufacturer provided data or curves, and Contractor supplied data, curves, 
and equations. Contractor shall submit all correction calculations, 
correction data and any thermal models for review and approval 60 days 
prior to commencement of testing.
 
6.2 	Instrument Calibration

Instrument calibration shall meet ASME PTC Code requirements. Test 
Contractor shall submit all instrument calibration data to the Contractor 
and Owner for review prior to the commencement of the Performance Test. 
Flow devices meeting the requirements set forth by ASME Code to measure 
primary parameters and variables need not undergo inspection following the 
performance test if the devices have not experienced conditions that would 
violate their integrity. Such conditions include steam blows and chemical 
cleaning.
 
6.3 	Test Equipment and Instruments

The Contractor will have the responsibility for providing all test 
instrumentation and equipment, whether temporary or permanently installed. 
Instrumentation shall meet the requirements of the applicable ASME PTC 
Code, in order that the calculated pre test uncertainty does not exceed 
ASME Code requirements. Primary condensate flow instrumentation shall be 
supplied and calibrated in accordance with ASME PTC 6  2004, and shall 
remain the property of the Owner after the completion of Performance 
Testing.
 
6.4 	Test Interruption

Test runs are not required to be continuous, but shall occur within the 
same 72 hour period, in order to assure that the Unit 6 configuration and 
the test conditions are relatively similar. The Owner may waive this 
requirement.
 
6.5 	Unit 6 Performance Testing

The Unit 6 Performance Test will be in accordance with ASME PTC 46-1996 
Performance Code on Overall Plant Performance, except where modified by 
the Contract, or by mutual agreement by the Parties to the Test.

For a coal fired unit, this will require determination of steam generator 
efficiency, in order to calculate primary heat input, in accordance with 
ASME PTC 4 - 1998, Energy Balance method, except as noted in this Exhibit.

The Performance Guarantee applies to the testing of Unit 6. Common loads 
shared with Unit 5 will be proportioned to each Unit.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.5.1 	Electrical Terminal Point of Guarantees  Unit 6 Performance Testing

The electrical terminal point of the Unit 6 Performance Guarantee is as 
measured at the high side of the main step up transformers. Transformer 
losses (main step up and aux) due to corrections to Base Performance 
Conditions will be included as part of the post test corrections.

Material Handling auxiliary load terminal point will be considered the 
inlet (delivery point from truck or rail carrier) of the coal, limestone 
and lime unloading hoppers or transport piping. For gypsum and ash, the 
terminal point will be the ash silos and gypsum storage pile.
 
6.5.2 	Unit 6 Performance Test Auxiliary Loads

The Unit 6 Net Output and Heat Rate Guarantee shall include all auxiliary 
loads, including pumps, fans, motors, heaters, air conditioning, lighting, 
material handling and miscellaneous equipment that are required to operate 
the equipment in a normal plant configuration.

The Unit 6 Net Output and Heat Rate Guarantees are based on the electrical 
auxiliary loads for major JPDA equipment as listed in Table L-2.2. The 
Performance Guarantees will be revised to incorporate changes in any of the 
Table L-2.2 values due to final equipment selections.

The auxiliary load methodology for the Unit 6 Performance Test will be 
based on operation of Unit 6 during the Base Performance Condition (summer 
day). As part of the PTP, the Contractor will submit, for approval, a load 
list, indicating the test operating status of all plant electrical 
equipment greater than 2 hp (valve motor operators need not be accounted 
for): The following is the type of operation that is expected:
 
  	 	  	

All normal interior lighting shall be energized.

 
  	 	  	

All air conditioning/heating/ventilation required to maintain the plant 
environment on the test day will be operating.

shall be characterized prior to the Unit 6 Performance Test. The Contractor 
will submit as part of the PTP, procedures for the determination of these 
cycling loads, for Owner approval. Fuel, Ash, Limestone, Lime, Gypsum, make 
up and waste water handling (except AQCS purge stream treatment) auxiliary 
loads will be determined based on testing done prior to the Unit 6 
Performance Testing. The methodology shall also contain procedures and 
calculations for the proportioning of auxiliary loads to Unit 6 and the 
Unit 5 Scrubber.

Auxiliary loads for major Owner Equipment will be individually measured for 
determining satisfaction of Owner Equipment Contract guarantees.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Preliminary testing and results calculations shall occur prior to 
commencement of Unit 6 Performance Testing (this testing is not required 
for Substantial Completion). Results shall be submitted to the Owner and 
approved prior to Unit 6 Performance Testing.

Testing will determine the kw-hr consumed per unit of material, for 
correction to the plant auxiliary loads measured. Where appropriate, and 
approved by the Owner, operation of cycling loads during the test can be 
substituted. For example, coal reclaim auxiliary load could be determined 
by characterization test or by returning the coal silo to pre test levels 
prior to the end of the test runs.
 
6.5.3 	Unit Configuration

During the Unit 6 Performance Test, Unit 6 will be aligned and operated in 
the normal plant configuration  as approved by the Owner, with regards to

normal pressure

 
8.0 	Minimum Stable Load

Coal (twenty-four hour test firing coal) - This test will identify minimum 
stable load which can be maintained indefinitely without fuel oil support 
using two (2) mills. Minimum load on coal shall be no greater than 30% of 
BMCR for fuels as specified in Steam Generator Performance Guarantees.
 
9.0 	Reliability Demonstration

Reliability Demonstration shall mean the operation of the Unit by Owner 
under the technical oversight of Contractor for a period of *** after the 
Minimum Performance Guarantees with respect to the Unit have been met [but 
prior to Final Completion of such Unit] by which the Contractor 
demonstrates to Owner that the Unit shall be capable of meeting the 
reliability criteria set forth in this Exhibit. Notification requirements 
for this test are the same as Performance Test notification.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
The average net electrical output during the Reliability Test shall be 
maintained and measured at the high side of the main step up transformer. 
The time weighted average net electrical output of the Unit generated 
during the Reliability Test period shall be utilized in determining the 
Test Results. Test results will only be corrected to ambient wet and dry 
bulb base reference conditions and power factor. This correction procedure 
may be done using an integrated plant computer model (such as Thermoflow 
Steam Master).

The acceptance criteria shall be an average of *** during the *** period. 
This criteria is based on the electrical auxiliary load for major *** 
equipment as listed in Table L-2.2 of Exhibit L-2. The acceptance criteria 
will be revised to incorporate changes in any of the Table L-2.2 values due 
to final equipment selections. Operation is not limited to the ***. Fuels 
used during the test shall be as specified in the Boiler Performance 
Guarantees.

If the test is aborted or acceptance criteria electrical demand is not 
maintained by the Owner, this period shall be exempted from the test 
results, without extending the required test duration of ***. For example, 
if Owner cannot provide electrical demand for *** of the *** period, then 
*** will be used in the calculation of test results.
