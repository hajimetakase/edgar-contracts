AMENDED AND RESTATED

AMB 2005


NONQUALIFIED DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN

Purpose

     AMB Property Corporation, a Maryland corporation (the Company) 
established the AMB Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan effective 
September 1, 1999, as amended and restated September 1, 2002 (the 
Grandfathered Plan) under which all deferred amounts were vested on or 
before December 31, 2004 and not subject to Section 409A of the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code). In order to preserve the 
exemption from Section 409A of the Code for the Grandfathered Plan, the 
vested amounts deferred thereunder and the earnings on such vested amounts 
so deferred, deferrals for amounts vested on or after January 1, 2005 shall 
no longer be allowed under the Grandfathered Plan.

     The Company previously adopted the AMB 2005 Nonqualified Deferred 
Compensation Plan for the benefit of a select group of management and 
highly compensated Employees and Directors who contribute materially to the 
continued growth, development and future business success of AMB Property, 
L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the Partnership), and the Company 
and its subsidiaries, if any, that sponsor the plan. This plan was intended 
to comply with the provisions of and the Department of Treasury proposed 
and final rules, regulations and other guidance promulgated under Section 
409A of the Code and not result in a penalty tax thereunder. In April 2007, 
the Department of Treasury issued final regulations pursuant to Section 
409A of the Code. To conform with the final regulations, the Company hereby 
amends and restates the AMB 2005 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan 
(as amended and restated, the Plan). Any deferred amounts under the 
Grandfathered Plan which were not earned and vested as of December 31, 2004 
shall automatically transfer to this Plan. This Plan shall be unfunded for 
tax purposes and for purposes of Title I of ERISA.

     This Plan shall consist of two plans, one for the benefit of a select 
group of management and highly compensated employees of the Employers as 
described in Sections 201(2), 301(a)(3) and 401(a)(1) of ERISA, and one for 
the benefit of Non-Employee members of the boards of directors of any 
Employer. To the extent required by law, the terms of this Plan applicable 
to Directors shall also constitute a separate written plan document with 
its terms set forth in the applicable portions of this Plan.


ARTICLE 1.
DEFINITIONS

     As used within this document, the following words and phrases have the 
meanings described in this Article 1 unless a different meaning is required 
by the context. Some of the words and phrases used in the Plan are not 
defined in this Article 1, but for convenience, are defined as they are 
introduced into the text. Words in the masculine gender shall be deemed to 
include the feminine gender. Any headings used are included for ease of 
reference only and are not to be construed so as to alter any of the terms 
of the Plan.

     1.1 Account Balance shall mean, with respect to a Participant, a 
credit on the records of the Employer equal to the sum of (i) the Deferral 
Account balance, (ii) the vested Company Contribution Account balance, 
(iii) the vested Company Matching Account balance, and (iv) the Restricted 
Stock Account balance. The Account Balance, and each other specified 
account balance, shall be a bookkeeping entry only and shall be utilized 
solely as a device for the measurement and determination of the amounts to 
be paid to a Participant, or his or her designated Beneficiary, pursuant to 
this Plan.

-1-

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

     1.2 Accounts of a Participant shall mean, as the context indicates, 
either or all of his or her Deferral Account, Company Contribution Account, 
Company Matching Account and Restricted Stock Account.

     1.3 Administrator shall mean the Committee appointed pursuant to 
Article 10 to administer the Plan, or such other person or persons to whom 
the Committee has delegated its duties pursuant to Article 10.

     1.4 Annual Bonus shall mean any compensation, in addition to Base 
Annual Salary relating to services performed during any calendar year, 
whether or not paid in such calendar year or included on the Federal Income 
Tax Form W-2 for such calendar year, payable to a Participant as an 
Employee under any Employers annual bonus and cash incentive plans, 
excluding stock options and restricted stock.

     1.5 Annual Company Contribution Amount shall mean, for any one Plan 
Year, the amount determined in accordance with Section 3.6(b).

     1.6 Annual Company Matching Amount for any one Plan Year shall be 
the amount determined in accordance with Section 3.6(c).

     1.7 Annual Deferral Amount shall mean that portion of a 
Participants Base Annual Salary, Annual Bonus and Directors Fees that a 
Participant elects to have, and is deferred, in accordance with Article 3, 
for any one Plan Year. In the event of a Participants Retirement, 
Disability, death or a Termination of Employment prior to the end of a Plan 
Year, such years Annual Deferral Amount shall be the actual amount 
withheld prior to such event.

     1.8 Annual Installment Method shall be an annual installment payment 
over the number of years selected by the Participant in accordance with 
this Plan, calculated as follows: The Account Balance of the Participant 
(or the Fixed Date Payout Account Balance, in the event of a Fixed Date 
Payout) shall be calculated as of the close of business three business days 
prior to the last business day of the fourth quarter preceding the 
distribution. The annual installment shall be calculated by multiplying 
this balance by a fraction, the numerator of which is one, and the 
denominator of which is the remaining number of yearly payments due the 
Participant. By way of example, if the Participant elects a ten year Annual 
Installment Method, the first payment shall be 1/10 of the Account Balance 
(or the Fixed Date Payout Account Balance, in the event of a Fixed Date 
Payout), calculated as described in this definition. The following year, 
the payment shall be 1/9 of the Account Balance (or the Fixed Date Payout 
Account Balance, in the event of a Fixed Date Payout), calculated as 
described in this definition.

     1.9 Base Annual Salary shall mean the annual cash compensation 
relating to services performed during any calendar year, whether or not 
paid in such calendar year or included on the Federal Income Tax Form W-2 
for such calendar year, excluding bonuses, commissions, overtime, fringe 
benefits, stock options, relocation expenses, incentive payments, 
non-monetary awards, directors fees and other fees, automobile and other 
allowances paid to a Participant for employment services rendered (whether 
or not such allowances are included in the Employees gross income). Base 
Annual Salary shall be calculated before reduction for compensation 
voluntarily deferred or contributed by the Participant pursuant to all 
qualified or non-qualified plans of any Employer and shall be calculated to 
include amounts not otherwise included in the Participants gross income 
under Code Sections 125, 132(f), 402(e)(3), 402(h), or 403(b) pursuant to 
plans established by any Employer; provided, however, that all such amounts

would be performed after a certain date or that the level of bona fide 
services the Participant would perform after such date would permanently 
decrease to no more than twenty percent (20%) of the average level of bona 
fide services performed over the immediately preceding 36-month period (or 
the full period in which the Participant provided services to the Employer 
if the Participant has been providing services for less than 36 months), as 
determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion.

     (a) Facts and circumstances which may be considered in determining 
whether a Separation of Service occurred, include, without limitation, 
whether the Participant continues to be treated as an employee for other 
purposes (such as continuation of salary and participation in employee 
benefit programs), whether similarly situated service providers have been 
treated consistently, and whether the Participant is eligible to perform 
services for, and realistically available to perform services for, other 
employers in the same line of business.

     (b) In addition, a Separation from Service shall be presumed to occur 
in the following instances:

  	(i) 	  	if a Participants period of leave exceeds six (6) months and

Employee at an annual rate that is at least equal to twenty percent (20%)

presumed not to occur in the following instances:

-7-

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

  	(i) 	  	the mere change in capacity in which the Participant renders 
service to the Company, the Partnership or any other Employer from an 
Officer or Employee to Director or vice-versa;
 
  	(ii) 	  	the employment relationship is treated as continuing intact 
while the Participant is on military leave, sick leave or other bona fide 
leave of absence (such as temporary employment by the government) if the 
period of such leave does not exceed six (6) months, or if longer, so long 
as the individuals right to reemployment or service with the Company or an 
Employer is provided by either statute or contract; provided that with 
respect to a disability leave, the employment relationship will be treated 
as continuing for a period of up to 29 months, unless terminated earlier by 
the Participant or Employer, regardless of whether the Participant retains 
a contractual right to reemployment;
 
  	(iii) 	  	where an Officer or Employee continues to provide services to 
a prior Employer in a capacity other than as an employee and such Officer 
or Employee is providing services at an annual rate that is fifty percent 
(50%) or more of the services rendered, on average, during the immediately 
preceding three full calendar years of employment (or if employed less than 
three years, such lesser period).

     In determining whether a separation of service has occurred, periods 
during which the Participant is on an unpaid bona fide leave of absence are 
disregarded (including for purposes of determining the relevant 36-month 
period), and periods during which the Participant is on a paid bona fide 
leave of absence are treated as periods during which the Participant 
provided services at the level at which the Participant would have been 
required to perform services to receive the compensation if not on a bona 
fide leave of absence. A leave of absence constitutes a bona fide leave of 
absence only if there is a reasonable expectation that the Participant will 
return to perform services for the Company or Employer.

     Disability leave means leave due to the Participants inability to 
perform the duties of his or her position or any substantially similar 
position by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental 
impairment that can be expected to result in death or can be expected to 
last for a continuous period of not less than six months.

to the Company and Employer, as determined by the Administrator in its sole 
discretion.

     1.60 Trust shall mean one or more trusts established pursuant to 
that certain Trust Agreement, dated as of May 1, 2002, between the Company 
and the trustee named therein, as amended from time to time.

     1.61 Unforeseeable Financial Emergency shall mean an unanticipated 
emergency that is caused by an event beyond the control of the Participant 
that would result in severe financial hardship to the Participant not

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

not cause severe financial hardship, or cessation of deferrals under this 
Plan, resulting from (i) a sudden and unexpected illness or accident of the 
Participant or a dependent (as defined in Section 152(a) of the Code) of 
the Participant, (ii) a loss of the Participants property due to casualty, 
or (iii) such other extraordinary and unforeseeable circumstances arising 
as a result of events beyond the control of the Participant, all as 
determined in the sole discretion of the Administrator and which 
constitutes an unforeseeable emergency within the meaning of Section 
409A(a)(2)(B)(ii) of the Code. For the avoidance of doubt, an Unforeseeable 
Financial Emergency shall not include, among other things, sending a child 
to college or purchasing a home.

deferred hereunder, the date on which the last share or tranche of a 
Restricted Stock award would vest under the terms of the Equity Plan 
pursuant to which it was issued and the Participants Restricted Stock 
Agreement but for the election to defer such Restricted Stock (i.e., when a 
Restricted Stock award fully vests).

     1.63 Years of Service shall mean each twelve (12) month period 
during which a Participant is employed by an Employer, including, without 
limitation, service as a Director, whether or not continuous, and including 
periods commencing prior to the effective date of this Plan; provided, 
however, that in the case of a Participant whose employment with an 
Employer or service as a Director has been interrupted by a period of 
twelve (12) consecutive months or more (a Break in Service), his or her 
Years of Service prior to such Break in Service shall be disregarded for 
any purpose under the Plan.

  	(ii) 	  	on or prior to December 31, 2005, a Participant may change the

or that would cause payments to be made in 2006 that would not otherwise be 
payable in such year,

provided further, that such Election Form is accepted by the Administrator 
in its sole discretion.

     3.4 Annual Minimum. For each Plan Year, the annual aggregate minimum 
deferral amount for each Participant is $5,000. If an election is made for 
less than such minimum amount, or if no election is made, the amount 
deferred shall be zero.

     3.5 Maximum Deferral.

     (a) Base Annual Salary, Annual Bonus and Directors Fees. For each Plan 
Year, a Participant may elect to defer, as his or her Annual Deferral 
Amount, up to 100% of his or her Base Annual Salary, Annual Bonus and/or 
Directors Fees.

     (b) Restricted Stock Amounts. A Participant may elect to defer up to 
100% of his or her Restricted Stock. Restricted Stock Amounts may also be 
limited by other terms or conditions set forth in the plan or agreement 
under which such Restricted Stock is granted.

     3.6 Accounts; Crediting of Deferrals. Solely for record keeping 
purposes, the Administrator shall establish a Deferral Account, a Company 
Contribution Account, a Company Matching Account and a Restricted Stock 
Account for each Participant. A Participants Accounts shall be credited 
with the deferrals made by him or her or on his or her behalf by his or her 
Employer under this Article 3 and shall be credited (or charged, as the 
case may be) with the hypothetical or deemed investment earnings and losses 
determined pursuant to Section 3.8, and charged with distributions made to 
or with respect to him or her.

     (a) Annual Deferral Amounts. For each Plan Year, the Base Annual 
Salary portion of the Annual Deferral Amount shall be withheld and credited 
to the Participants Deferral Account at the time of each regularly 
scheduled Base Annual Salary payroll in either the percentages or dollar 
amounts specified by the Participant in the Election Form, as adjusted from 
time to time for increases and decreases in Base Annual Salary. The Annual 
Bonus and/or Directors Fees portion of the Annual Deferral Amount shall be 
withheld and credited to the Participants Deferral Account at the time the 
Annual Bonus or Directors Fees are or otherwise would be paid to the 
Participant, whether or not this occurs during the Plan Year itself.

     (b) Annual Company Contribution Amount. For each Plan Year, an 
Employer, in its sole discretion, may, but is not required to, credit any 
amount it desires to any Participants Company Contribution Account under 
this Plan, which amount shall be for that Participant the Annual Company 
Contribution Amount for that Plan Year. The amount so credited to a

-12-

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

Participant may be smaller or larger than the amount credited to any other 
Participant, and the amount credited to any Participant for a Plan Year may 
be zero, even though one or more other Participants receive an Annual 
Company Contribution Amount for that Plan Year. The Annual Company 
Contribution Amount, if any, shall be credited to Participants Company 
Contribution Accounts on the date declared by the Employer.

     (c) Annual Company Matching Amount. For each Plan Year, an Employer, 
in its sole discretion, may, but is not required to, credit any amount it 
desires to any Participants Company Matching Account under this Plan, 
which amount shall be for that Participant the Annual Company Matching 
Amount for that Plan Year. The amount so credited to a Participant may be 
smaller or larger than the amount credited to any other Participant, and 
the amount credited to any Participant for a Plan Year may be zero, even 
though one or more other Participants receive an Annual Company 
Contribution Amount for that Plan Year. The Annual Company Contribution 
Amount, if any, shall be credited to Participants Company Matching 
Accounts on the date declared by the Employer.

     (d) Restricted Stock Amounts. Restricted Stock Amounts shall be 
credited/debited to the Participant on the books of the Employer in 
connection with such an election on the vesting date of the individual 
tranche of the award. A Participants Restricted Stock Account shall be 
credited with that number of Stock Units equal to the quotient obtained by 
dividing (i) the aggregate amount of the Restricted Stock Amount then 
vesting and so deferred by (ii) the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock 
on the vesting date. Participants who elect to defer Restricted Stock 
Amounts will have no rights as stockholders of the Company with respect to 
allocations made to their Restricted Stock Accounts other than the right to 
receive dividend allocations as described in Section 3.6(e).

     (e) Dividends. Stock and Non-Stock Dividends payable with respect to 
Stock Units allocated to a Participants Accounts may be credited by the 
Administrator to the Participants Accounts in the form of additional Stock 
Units or fractional Stock Units as of the date upon which the Company makes 
such a distribution to its stockholders, as follows:

  	(i) 	  	Each of the Participants Accounts would be credited with an 
additional number of Stock Units equal to the number of shares of Stock 
distributable as a dividend with respect to Stock Units credited to such 
Account (Stock Dividends); and
 
  	(ii) 	  	In the event of a cash dividend or other non-Stock amount 
distributable with respect to Stock (Non-Stock Dividends), each of the 
Participants Accounts would be credited with an amount in cash equal to 
such Non-Stock Dividend. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such cash amounts 
shall not be credited to a Restricted Stock Account.

     Alternatively, the Administrator, in its discretion, may provide for 
Stock or Non-Stock Dividends to be credited to a Participants Accounts, 
including a Participants Deferral Account, in a different manner.

     3.7 Vesting. A Participant shall at all times be 100% vested in his or 
her Deferral Account, Restricted Stock Account, Company Contribution 
Account and Company Matching Account.

     3.8 Earnings Credits or Losses. In accordance with, and subject to, 
the rules and procedures that are established from time to time by the 
Administrator, in its sole discretion, amounts shall be credited or debited 
to a Participants Account Balance in accordance with the following rules:

-13-

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

     (a) Election of Measurement Funds. A Participant, in connection with 
his or her initial deferral election in accordance with Section 3.1 above, 
shall elect, on the Election Form, one or more Measurement Fund(s) (as 
described in Section 3.8(c) below) to be used to determine the additional 
amounts to be credited to his or her Account Balance, unless changed in 
accordance with the next sentence. The Participant may (but is not required 
to) elect, by submitting an Election Form to the Administrator that is 
accepted by the Administrator, to add or delete one or more Measurement 
Fund(s) to be used to determine the additional amounts to be credited to 
his or her Account Balance, or to change the portion of his or her Account 
Balance allocated to each previously or newly elected Measurement Fund. If 
an election is made in accordance with the previous sentence, it shall 
become effective as soon as administratively practicable and shall continue 
thereafter until changed in accordance with the previous sentence. Changes 
may be made to allocations at any time during the Plan Year, up to a 
maximum of six (6) changes per Participant per Plan Year.

     (b) Proportionate Allocation. In making any election described in 
Section 3.8(a) above, the Participant shall specify on the Election Form, 
in increments of whole percentage points (1%), the percentage of his or her 
Account Balance to be allocated to a Measurement Fund (as if the 
Participant was making an investment in that Measurement Fund with that 
portion of his or her Account Balance).

     (c) Measurement Funds. The Administrator shall from time to time 
select types of Measurement Funds and specific Measurement Funds for deemed 
investment designation by Participants for the purpose of crediting 
additional amounts to his or her Account Balance. As necessary, the 
Administrator may, in its sole discretion, discontinue, substitute or add a 
Measurement Fund. The Administrator shall notify the Participants of the 
types of Measurement Funds and the specific Measurement Funds selected from 
time to time.

     (d) Crediting or Debiting Method. The performance of each elected 
Measurement Fund (either positive or negative) will be determined by the 
Administrator, in its sole discretion, based on the performance of the 
Measurement Funds themselves. A Participants Account Balance shall be 
credited or debited as frequently as is administratively feasible, but no 
less often than quarterly, based on the performance of each Measurement 
Fund selected by the Participant, as determined by the Administrator in its 
sole discretion.

     (e) No Actual Investment. Notwithstanding any other provision of this 
Plan that may be interpreted to the contrary, the Measurement Funds are to 
be used for measurement purposes only, and a Participants election of any 
such Measurement Fund, the allocation to his or her Account Balance 
thereto, the calculation of additional amounts and the crediting or 
debiting of such amounts to a Participants Account Balance shall not be 
considered or construed in any manner as an actual investment of his or her 
Account Balance in any such Measurement Fund. In the event that the Company 
or the Trustee (as that term is defined in the Trust), in its own 
discretion, decides to invest funds in any or all of the Measurement Funds, 
no Participant shall have any rights in or to such investments themselves. 
Without limiting the foregoing, a Participants Account Balance shall at 
all times be a bookkeeping entry only and shall not represent any 
investment made on his or her behalf by the Employer or the Trust; the 
Participant shall at all times remain an unsecured creditor of the 
Employers.

     (f) Stock Accounts. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan 
to the contrary Restricted Stock Amounts may not be allocated to any 
Measurement Fund. A Participants Restricted Stock Account will be credited 
with any Restricted Stock Amounts deferred pursuant to Section 3.6(d) and 
any dividends deferred pursuant to Section 3.1(c).

-14-

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

     3.9 Distributions. Any distribution with respect to a Participants 
Account Balance shall be charged to the appropriate account as of the date 
such payment is made by the Employer or the trustee of the Trust which may 
be established for the Plan.


ARTICLE 4.
FIXED DATE PAYOUTS

     4.1 Fixed Date Payout. In connection with each Election Form, a 
Participant may irrevocably elect to receive a future Fixed Date Payout 
from the Plan of his or her Fixed Date Payout Account Balance. Subject to 
the Deduction Limitation and the other terms and conditions of this Plan, 
each Fixed Date Payout elected shall be paid out no earlier than the first 
day of any Plan Year designated by the Participant that is (i) with respect 
to an Annual Deferral Amount, at least one (1) Plan Year after the Plan 
Year in which the Annual Deferral Amount is actually deferred or (ii) with 
respect to a Restricted Stock Amount, the Plan Year of the Vesting Date 
(the Earliest Fixed Date Payout Date). By way of example, if a one (1) 
year Fixed Date Payout is elected for Annual Deferral Amounts that are 
deferred in the Plan Year commencing January 1, 2006, the one (1) year 
Fixed Date Payout would become payable no earlier than January 1, 2007; 
and, if a Fixed Date Payout is elected for a Restricted Stock Amount 
granted on March 1, 2006 with a five (5) year vesting period on January 1 
of each year, the Fixed Date Payout would become payable no earlier than 
January 1, 2011. A Participant shall elect on each Election Form on which a 
Fixed Date Payout is elected to receive the Fixed Date Payout Account 
Balance applicable to such election in a lump sum or pursuant to a 
Quarterly or Annual Installment Method over a period of up to ten (10) 
years, payable in the first (1st) week of January, April, July, and 
October, as applicable. If a Participant does not elect to have his or her 
Fixed Date Payout Account Balance paid in accordance with the Quarterly or 
Annual Installment Method, then such benefit shall be payable in a lump 
sum. The lump sum payment shall be made no later than sixty (60) days after 
the last day of any Plan Year designated by the Participant that is after 
the Earliest Fixed Date Payout Date. Any payment made shall be subject to 
the Deduction Limitation.

     4.2 Other Benefits Take Precedence Over Fixed Date. Should an event 
occur that triggers a benefit under Article 5 or 6, any Annual Deferral 
Amount or Restricted Stock Amount, plus amounts credited or debited 
thereon, that is subject to a Fixed Date Payout election under Section 4.1 
shall not be paid in accordance with Section 4.1 but shall be paid in 
accordance with the other applicable Article.

or pursuant to a Quarterly or Annual Installment Method over a period of up 
to ten (10) years, payable in the first (1st) week of January, April, July, 
and October, as applicable. If a Participant does not make any election 
with respect to the payment of the Retirement Benefit, then such benefit 
shall be payable in a lump sum. The lump sum payment shall be made, or 
installment payments shall commence, no later than the later of (i) 
December 31 of the calendar year during which the Participant Retires or 
(ii) the fifteenth (15th) day of the third (3rd) month following the date 
of such Retirement.

Benefit. If a Participant dies after Retirement but before the Retirement

of Employment but before the Termination Benefit under Section 5.3 is paid 
in full, the Participants unpaid Retirement Benefit under this Section 5.1 
or Termination Benefit under Section 5.3 shall be paid to the Participants 
Beneficiary over the

-15-

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

remaining number of months and in the same amounts as such Retirement 
Benefit or Termination Benefit would have been paid to the Participant had 
the Participant survived.

     5.2 Pre-Retirement Survivor Benefit. A Participants Beneficiary shall 
receive a Pre-Retirement Survivor Benefit equal to the Participants vested 
Account Balance if the Participant dies before he or she experiences a 
Termination of Employment or suffers a Disability. The Pre-Retirement

Fixed Date Payout has not commenced prior to Participants death, 
commencing no later than the later of (i) December 31 of the calendar year 
during which the Participant died or (ii) the fifteenth (15th) day of the 
third (3rd) month following the Participants death, and being paid in a 
lump sum, if so elected by Participant, or in installment payments, if so 
elected by Participant, over the number of months and in the same amounts 
as that benefit would have been paid to the Participant had the Participant 
survived, and (b) if a Fixed Date Payout has commenced prior to 
Participants death, over the remaining number of months and in the same 
amounts as that benefit would have been paid to the Participant had the 
Participant survived.

     5.3 Termination Benefit. A Participant shall receive a Termination 
Benefit, which shall be equal to the Participants vested Account Balance 
if a Participant experiences a Termination of Employment prior to his or 
her Retirement, death or Disability. A Participants Termination Benefit 
shall be paid in a lump sum; except that if the Participant is a 
Non-Employee Director such Participant may elect on an Election Form 
pursuant to Section 3.1 above to receive the Termination Benefit in a lump 
sum or pursuant to a Quarterly or Annual Installment Method over a period 
of up to ten (10) years, payable in the first (1st) week of January, April, 
July and October, as applicable; however, if no such election is made with 
respect to the payment of the Termination Benefit, then such benefit shall 
be payable in a lump sum. The lump sum payment shall be made, or 
installment payments shall commence, no later than the later of (i) 
December 31 of the calendar year during which the Participants Termination 
of Employment occurred or (ii) the fifteenth (15th) day of the third (3rd) 
month following the Participants Termination of Employment.

     5.4 Change in Control Benefit.

     (a) Change in Control Benefit. A Participant shall receive a Change in 
Control Benefit, which shall be equal to the Participants vested Account 
Balance in the event of a Change in Control. A Participants Change in 
Control Benefit due under this Section 5.4 shall be paid in a lump sum. The 
lump sum payment shall be made as soon as administratively practicable upon 
the Change in Control but in no event later than the later of (i) December 
31 of the calendar year during which the Change in Control occurs or (ii) 
the fifteenth (15th) day of third (3rd) month following the date of such 
Change in Control.

     (b) Change in Control Benefit to Take Precedence Over Other Benefits. 
Should an event occur that triggers a Change in Control Benefit under this 
Section 5.4, any Annual Deferral Amount, plus amounts credited or debited 
thereon, that is subject to an existing payout under Section 4.1 shall not 
be paid in accordance with such Article but shall be paid in accordance 
with this Section 5.4.

Benefit, which shall be equal to the Participants vested Account Balance 
in the event of the Participants Disability, as determined by the 
Administrator. Payment of a Participants Disability Benefit under this 
Section 5.5 shall be paid in a lump sum. If a Participants Disability 
occurs after Retirement or after a Termination of Employment but before the 
Retirement Benefit under Section 5.1 or the Termination Benefit under 
Section 5.3 is paid in full, the Participants unpaid Retirement Benefit 
under Section 5.1 or Termination Benefit under Section 5.3 shall continue 
and shall be paid to the Participant over the remaining number of

-16-

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

months and in the same amounts as such Retirement Benefit or such 
Termination Benefit would have been paid to the Participant had the 
Participant survived.

     5.6 Stock Distributions. All Account Balance distributions from a 
Participants Restricted Stock Account shall be in the form of whole shares 
of Stock equivalent to the whole Stock Units credited to the Participants 
Restricted Stock Account. Distributions in respect of fractional Stock 
Units shall be made in cash. In the case of any Quarterly or Annual 
Installment Method, the precise number of shares delivered in each 
installment shall be determined in such a manner as to cause each 
installment to be essentially equal based on the Stock Units credited to 
the Participants accounts as of the date of the first installment, 
including dividend equivalents credited prior to that date. Dividend 
equivalents credited to a Participants Restricted Stock Account after the 
date of the first installment will be distributed as part of the final 
installment. Any fractional Stock Units remaining at the time of the final 
installment distribution shall be payable in cash.

     5.7 Delayed Distributions for Employee Participants. Notwithstanding 
any provision of this Plan to the contrary, upon the Termination of 
Employment or Retirement of a Participant who is an Officer or Employee for 
any reason other than death or Disability, any Account Balance distribution 
that otherwise would be paid to Participant during the period of time 
beginning with such Termination of Employment or Retirement and ending six 
months thereafter shall not be paid during such six-month period but shall 
be delayed and instead paid in a lump sum as soon as administratively 
practicable following such six-month delay period. There shall be no such 
six-month delay period in the event of and any six-month delay period which 
has already commenced shall terminate immediately upon (i) the 
Participants death or Disability or (ii) a Change in Control. For the 
avoidance of doubt, any Quarterly or Annual Installment Method payments due 
to Participant after any such delay period shall not be accelerated by 
application of this Section 5.7 and may only be accelerated to the extent 
such acceleration is provided for in another Plan provision.

any deferrals required to be made by a Participant and/or (ii) receive a 
partial or full payout from the Plan. The payout shall not exceed the 
lesser of the Participants vested Account Balance, calculated as if such 
Participant were receiving a Termination Benefit under Section 5.3, or the 
amount reasonably needed to satisfy the Unforeseeable Financial Emergency. 
If, subject to the sole discretion of the Administrator, the petition for a 
suspension and/or payout is approved, suspension shall take effect upon the 
date of approval and any payout shall be made within sixty (60) days of the 
date of approval but in no event shall any payout be made following the

Unforeseeable Financial Emergency occurs and (b) the fifteenth (15th) day

to designate his or her Beneficiary(ies) (both primary as well as 
contingent) to receive any benefits payable under the Plan to a beneficiary

other plan of an Employer in which the Participant participates.

the terms of the Beneficiary Designation Form and the Administrators rules 
and procedures, as in effect from time to time. Upon the acceptance by the 
Administrator of a new Beneficiary Designation Form, all Beneficiary

entitled to rely on the last Beneficiary Designation Form filed by the 
Participant and accepted by the Administrator prior to his or her death.

     7.3 Acknowledgment. No designation or change in designation of a 
Beneficiary shall be effective until received and acknowledged in writing 
by the Administrator or its designated agent.

Beneficiary as provided in Sections 7.1, 7.2 and 7.3 above or, if all 
designated Beneficiaries predecease the Participant or die prior to 
complete distribution of the Participants benefits, then the Participants 
designated Beneficiary shall be deemed to be his or her surviving spouse. 
If the Participant has no surviving spouse, the benefits remaining under 
the Plan to be paid to a Beneficiary shall be payable to the executor or

resolved to the Administrators satisfaction.

     7.6 Discharge of Obligations. The payment of benefits under the Plan 
to a Beneficiary shall fully and completely discharge all Employers and the 
Administrator from all further obligations under this Plan with respect to 
the Participant, and that Participants Election Form shall terminate upon 
such full payment of benefits.


ARTICLE 8.
LEAVE OF ABSENCE

     8.1 Paid Leave of Absence. If a Participant is authorized by the 
Participants Employer for any reason to take a paid leave of absence from 
the employment of the Employer, the Participant shall continue to be 
considered employed by the Employer and the Annual Deferral Amount shall 
continue to be withheld during such paid leave of absence in accordance 
with Section 3.6.


ARTICLE 9.

modification shall be effective to decrease or restrict the value of a 
Participants Account Balance in existence at the time the

amendment or modification is made, calculated as if the Participant had 
experienced a Termination of Employment as of the effective date of the 
amendment or modification or, if the amendment or modification occurs after 
the date upon which the Participant was eligible to Retire, the Participant 
had Retired as of the effective date of the amendment or modification. The 
amendment or modification of the Plan shall not affect any Participant or 
Beneficiary who has become entitled to the payment of benefits under the 
Plan as of the date of the amendment or modification.

     9.3 Effect of Payment. The full payment of the applicable benefit 
under Article 4 of the Plan or under Articles 5 and 6 of the Plan shall 
completely discharge all obligations to a Participant and his or her 
designated Beneficiaries under this Plan and the Participants Plan 
Agreement shall terminate.

expressly declared to be, unassignable and non-transferable. No part of the 
amounts payable shall, prior to actual payment, be subject to seizure, 
attachment, garnishment or sequestration for the payment of any debts, 
judgments, alimony or separate maintenance owed by a Participant or any 
other person, be transferable by operation of law in the event of a 
Participants or any other persons bankruptcy or insolvency or be 
transferable to a spouse as a result of a property settlement or otherwise.

     15.5 Sources of Stock. If Stock is credited under the Plan in the 
Trust in connection with a deferral of Restricted Stock, the shares so 
credited shall be deemed to have originated, and shall be counted against 
the number of shares reserved under the Equity Plan under which they were 
granted.

     15.6 Tax Withholding.

     (a) Annual Deferral Amounts. For each Plan Year in which an Annual 
Deferral Amount is being withheld from a Participant, the Participants 
Employer(s) shall withhold from that portion of the Participants Base 
Annual Salary and Bonus that is not being deferred, in a manner determined

portion of his or her Company Matching Account, the Participants 
Employer(s) shall withhold from the Participants Base Annual Salary and/or

Matching Account in order to comply with this Section 15.6.

     (c) Restricted Stock Amounts. For each Plan Year in which a Restricted 
Stock Amount is being first credited to a Participants Account Balance, or 
at the time any dividends are credited to the Participants Accounts, the 
Participants Employer(s) shall withhold from that portion of the 
Participants Base Annual Salary, Bonus and Restricted Stock that is not 
being deferred, in a manner determined by the Employer(s), the 
Participants share of FICA and other employment taxes on such Restricted 
Stock Amount. If necessary, the Administrator may reduce the Restricted 
Stock Amount in order to comply with this Section 15.6.

     (d) Distributions. The Participants Employer(s), or the trustee of 
the Trust, shall withhold from any payments made to a Participant under 
this Plan all federal, state and local income, employment and other taxes 
required to be withheld by the Employer(s), or the trustee of

-24-

the Trust, in connection with such payments, in amounts and in a manner to 
be determined in the sole discretion of the Employer(s) and the trustee of 
the Trust.

     (e) Participant May Satisfy Tax Obligations in Cash. The 
Administrator, in its sole discretion, may allow a Participant to pay to 
his or her Employer, in cash, any amounts required to be withheld by the 
Employer in connection with the Plan in lieu of having such amounts 
withheld from his or her deferrals or distributions.

     15.7 Coordination with Other Benefits. The benefits provided for a 
Participant and Participants Beneficiary under the Plan are in addition to 
any other benefits available to such Participant under any other plan or 
program for employees of the Participants Employer. The Plan shall 
supplement and shall not supersede, modify or amend any other such plan or 
program except as may otherwise be expressly provided.

     15.8 Compliance. A Participant shall have no right to receive payment 
with respect to the Participants Account Balance until all legal and 
contractual obligations of the Employers relating to establishment of the 
Plan and the making of such payments shall have been complied with in full. 
In addition, the Company shall impose such restrictions on Stock delivered 
to a Participant hereunder and any other interest constituting a security 
as it may deem advisable in order to comply with the Securities Act, the 
requirements of the New York Stock Exchange or any other stock exchange or 
automated quotation system upon which the Stock is then listed or quoted, 
any state securities laws applicable to such a transfer, any provision of 
the Companys Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws, or any other applicable 
law or applicable regulation.

     15.9 Not a Contract of Employment. The terms and conditions of this 
Plan shall not be deemed to constitute a contract of employment between any 
Employer and the Participant. Such employment is hereby acknowledged to be 
an at will employment relationship that can be terminated at any time for 
any reason, or no reason, with or without cause, and with or without 
notice, unless expressly provided in a written employment agreement. 
Nothing in this Plan shall be deemed to give a Participant the right to be 
retained in the service of any Employer, either as an Employee or a 
Director, or to interfere with the right of any Employer to discipline or 
discharge the Participant at any time.

     15.10 Furnishing Information. A Participant or his or her Beneficiary 
will cooperate with the Administrator by furnishing any and all information 
requested by the Administrator and take such other actions as may be

payments of benefits hereunder, including but not limited to taking such 
physical examinations as the Administrator may deem necessary.

shall be construed and interpreted according to the internal laws of the 
State of California without regard to its conflicts of laws principles.

Participant under this Plan shall be sufficient if in writing and 
hand-delivered, or sent by mail, to the last known address of the 
Participant.

the benefit of the Participants Employer and its successors and assigns 
and the Participant and the Participants designated Beneficiaries.

     15.14 Spouses Interest. The interest in the benefits hereunder of a 
spouse of a Participant who has predeceased the Participant shall 
automatically pass to the Participant and shall not be transferable by such 
spouse in any manner, including but not limited to such spouses will, nor 
shall such interest pass under the laws of intestate succession.

     15.15 Validity. In case any provision of this Plan shall be illegal or 
invalid for any reason, said illegality or invalidity shall not affect the 
remaining parts hereof, but this Plan shall be construed and enforced as if 
such illegal or invalid provision had never been inserted herein.

     15.16 Incompetent. If the Administrator determines in its discretion 
that a benefit under this Plan is to be paid to a minor, a person declared 
incompetent or to a person incapable of handling the disposition of that 
persons property, the Administrator may direct payment of such benefit to 
the guardian, legal representative or person having the care and custody of 
such minor, incompetent or incapable person. The Administrator may require 
proof of minority, incompetence, incapacity or guardianship, as it may deem 
appropriate prior to distribution of the benefit. Any payment of a benefit 
shall be a payment for the account of the Participant and the Participants 
Beneficiary, as the case may be, and shall be a complete discharge of any 
liability under the Plan for such payment amount.

     15.17 Court Order. The Administrator is authorized to make any 
payments directed by court order in any action in which the Plan or the 
Administrator has been named as a party. In addition, if a court determines 
that a spouse or former spouse of a Participant has an interest in the 
Participants benefits under the Plan in connection with a property 
settlement or otherwise, the Administrator, in its sole discretion, shall 
have the right, notwithstanding any election made by a Participant, to 
immediately distribute the spouses or former spouses interest in the 
Participants benefits under the Plan to that spouse or former spouse.

     15.18 Accelerated Distributions, Trust Distributions and Plan 
Interpretation.

     (a) Accelerated Distributions. If, for any reason, all or any portion 
of a Participants benefits under this Plan becomes subject to a penalty 
tax amount under Section 409A and the final Department of Treasury rules, 
regulations and other guidance promulgated thereunder, the Administrator 
may rescind the election subject to such penalty tax and accelerate the 
payment of such benefits at its discretion, provided that any such 
distribution will remain subject to penalty tax to the extent required by 
Section 409A and the final rules and regulations.

     (b) Trust Distributions. If the Trust terminates in accordance with 
the provisions of the Trust and benefits are distributed from the Trust to 
a Participant in accordance with such provisions, the Participants 
benefits under this Plan shall be reduced to the extent of such 
distributions.

     (c) Plan Interpretation. The Plan shall be interpreted, construed, 
administered and operated in good faith in a manner that satisfies the 
requirements of Section 409A of the Code, Internal Revenue Service Notice 
2005-1 and the final and proposed Department of Treasury rules, regulations 
and other guidance promulgated thereunder. Nothing in this Plan shall be 
construed as an entitlement to or guarantee of any particular tax treatment 
to a Participant.

the trustee of the Trust, and, in their sole discretion, may apply for and 
procure insurance on the life of the Participant, in such amounts and in 
such forms as the Trust may choose. The Employers or the trustee of the 
Trust, as the case may be, shall be the sole owner and beneficiary of any 
such insurance. The Participant shall have no interest whatsoever in any 
such policy or policies, and at the request of the Employers shall submit

documents as may be required by the insurance company or companies to whom
