This letter, when signed on behalf of Charles & Colvard, Ltd. (C&C) and 
Cree, Inc. (Cree), will serve as an agreement between C&C and Cree to 
provide the following terms effective on and after December 25, 2007, 
amending the parties December 25, 2006 letter agreement:
 
  	1. 	Cree will supply Silicon Carbide (SiC) production crystals to C&C, 
and C&C will purchase SiC production crystals from Cree, according to the 
terms stated in this letter agreement.
 
  	2. 	C&C will purchase ***** kg each quarter of calendar 2008 of usable 
material (where usable material will be determined in the manner 
described in Paragraph 3) at a price of $*****/gram. Provided that Cree 
uses its best commercially reasonable efforts to deliver the quantities of 
usable material required by this letter agreement, Cree will not be held in 
breach for delays in delivery. As used in this letter agreement, quarter 
refers to fiscal quarters of Cree ending during the indicated period.
 
  	3. 	The quantity of usable material of crystals delivered to C&C 
pursuant to this letter agreement will be determined according to the 
following:
 
  	A. 	Material will be graded according to the specifications in 
Attachment A.
 
  	B. 	Grams of usable material will be calculated on a crystal-by-crystal 
basis according to the following equation: (usable mm) as a percent of 
total length of the crystal in mm multiplied by the actual weight of the 
crystal in grams. Usable mm means millimeters of usable material as 
defined in Attachment A.
 
  	C. 	Crystals shipped to C&C must contain at least ***** grams of usable 
material for the 2 crystals, ***** grams for 2.25 crystals, ***** grams 
for 2.40 crystals or ***** grams for 3 crystals. This usable area must be 
contiguous. Crystal diameter to be shipped will be 2, 2.25, 2.40 or 3, 
as determined by Cree.
 
  	4. 	Except as expressly provided herein, the supply and purchase of SiC 
material will be governed by the terms and conditions of the parties 
Amended and Restated Exclusive Supply Agreement dated June 6, 1997 (the 
Supply Agreement, as amended).
 
  	5. 	The contents of this letter agreement shall be considered 
Confidential Information of each party subject to the provisions of 
Section 5 of the Supply Agreement.

ATTACHMENT A


Specification of usable material as referenced in paragraph 2 above.

COLOR: Usable material is calculated as light gray or very light gray. 
Specifically tone/color number 20 and 10 1 as used in the C&C boule-grading 
screen will be considered acceptable tone and color material. (Note: Grade 
10 is preferred. Grade 20 material will be valued at $***** per-gram.)


DEFECTS:

Material volume of acceptable color will be reduced by the percentage of 
the defects listed in the table below. C&C shall set the acceptable 
standards for the quality of both the color and defects of all material 
purchased pursuant to this letter agreement. Unless otherwise mutually 
agreed by the parties in writing, however, the grading of the material by 
both Cree and C&C will adhere to those standards and methods identified in 
Notes 1 & 2 below, applied on a consistent basis in the same manner as 
applied during September, October and November of calendar 2003. Should C&C 
deem such standards and methods or new defects unacceptable, it can request 
changes to its volume commitment or the methods, standards or list of price 
reducing defects, with such changes to be effective sixty (60) days after 
giving Cree notice of the changes. Cree may request changes to its pricing 
and/or volume commitment. If the parties do not agree in writing on the 
changes to be made, before the effective date of the requested changes, 
either party can terminate this letter agreement upon notice and, in that 
event, the Supply Agreement will govern the parties obligations 
thereafter.

Notes
1 	CH0257R 17.4mm tone/color 20 (lightest 20), new gray boules that are 
lighter than this will grade as 10, CE0269R 9.5mm tone/color 30 (lightest 
30), new gray boules that are lighter than this will grade as 20
2 	Micropipe grading will be performed according to the Cree document 
identified as the CCG  948 Rev C, Dense Fine Pipe Grading procedure 
(Revision 8/17/06). The area determined according to this procedure 
multiplied by 1.2, (20% adder), defines the area of non-usable material 
for micropipes.
