        directors, officers, employees and agents (FPI Indemnitees) from
        and against all losses, liabilities, damages and expenses,
        including reasonable attorneys fees and costs (collectively, 
        Liabilities), incurred as a result of any claims, demands, actions
        or other proceedings by any Third Party to the extent resulting
        from: (a) the material breach of any representation, warranty or
        covenant by GDLS under this Agreement; or (b) the negligence or
        willful misconduct of GDLS. The obligation to indemnify pursuant to
        Section 7.1(a) will expire five (5) years after expiration or
        termination of this Agreement.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
        7.2                                 FPI will indemnify and hold
        harmless FDL and GDLS, its Affiliates and their respective
        directors, officers, employees and agents (GDLS Indemnitees).
        (For purposes of this Article 7 , the term Indemnitee may refer
        to any or all of FDI, the FPI Indemnitees and the GDLS Indemnitees,
        as the context may indicate) from and against all Liabilities,
        incurred as a result of any claims, demands, actions or other
        proceedings by any Third Party to the extent resulting from: (a)
        the material breach of any representation, warranty or covenant by
        FPI under this Agreement; or (b) the negligence or willful
        misconduct of FPI. The obligation to indemnify pursuant to Section
        7.2(a) will expire five (5) years after expiration or termination
        of this Partys Joint Venture Agreement or any resultant contract,
        subcontracts, purchase orders or other agreements, whichever is
        later.
         
        7.3                                 FDL will indemnify and hold
        harmless the GDLS Indemnitees and the FPI Indemnitees from and
        against all Liabilities, incurred as a result of any claims,
        demands, actions or other proceedings by any Third Party to the
        extent resulting from: (a) the material breach of any
        representation, warranty or covenant by FDL under this Agreement;
        or (b) the negligence or willful misconduct of FDL. The obligation
        to indemnify pursuant to Section 7.3 will expire five (5) years
        after expiration or termination of this Agreement.
         
        7.4                                 If a Party or Indemnitee
        intends to claim indemnification under this Article 7.4, it will
        promptly notify the indemnifying Party (the Indemnitor) in
        writing of any claim, demand, action or other proceeding for which
        the Indemnitee intends to claim such indemnification, and the
        Indemnitor may participate in, and, to the extent the Indemnitor so
        desires, assume the defense of such claim, demand, action or
        proceeding with counsel mutually satisfactory to the Parties; 
        provided, however, that an Indemnitee will have the right to retain
        its own counsel, with the fees and expenses to be paid by the
        Indemnitor, if representation of such Indemnitee by the counsel
        retained by the Indemnitor would be inappropriate due to actual or
        potential differing interests between the Indemnitee and any other
        Party represented by such counsel in such proceeding. The
        obligations of this Article 7.4 will not apply to amounts paid in
        settlement of any claim, demand, action or other proceeding if such
        settlement is effected without the consent of the Indemnitor, which
        consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The failure
        to deliver written notice to the Indemnitor within a reasonable
        time after the commencement of any such action, if prejudicial to
        its ability to defend such action, will relieve the Indemnitor of
        any obligation to the Indemnitee under this Article 7.4. The
        Indemnitee will reasonably cooperate with the Indemnitor and its
        legal representatives in the investigation of any claim, demand,
        action or other proceeding covered by this Article 7.4.
         
        7.5                                 Notwithstanding anything to the
        contrary in Articles 7.1-7.4 above, FPI and GDLS shall each
        indemnify and hold harmless the other Party from and against all
        Liabilities incurred as a result of any claim, demand, action or
        other proceeding brought by a Third Party alleging that the
        indemnified Partys use of the other Partys Background IP or
        solely-owned Foreground IF infringes the Third Partys patent,
        trademark, copyright, trade secret, or other proprietary
 
7
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
        rights, provided, however, such third party indemnity obligation
        shalt not apply if the indemnified Party has substantially or
        materially modified the other Partys Background IP or solely-owned
        Foreground IP. The process for seeking indemnification for such IP
        related claims, demands, actions or other proceedings shall be as
        set forth above in Article 7.4.
         
ARTICLE 8    Infringement
 
        8.1                                 Each Party shall notify the
        others immediately of any actual, suspected or anticipated
        infringement of the IP used in performance of the Program or any
        misappropriation of the Confidential Information of which it
        becomes aware.
         
        8.2                                 The Party owning or Controlling
        the potentially infringed IP or misappropriated Confidential
        Information may in its absolute discretion determine whether or not
        to take legal or other action against any Third Party for an actual
        or threatened or suspected infringement of the IP or
        misappropriation of the Confidential Information, and if the owning
        or Controlling Party elects to take legal or other action, such
        Party:
         
            (a)                                  shall bear all costs of
            the action;
             
            (b)                                 shall have sole control
            over the form and conduct of such action;
             
            (c)                                  may settle, compromise or
            discontinue the action as it thinks fit;
             
            (d)                                 shall be entitled to any
            award of costs and/or damages made in relation to such action;
            and
             
            (e)                                  shall indemnify the other
            Parties against any costs or damages for which either of them
            may become liable as a result of the proceedings, provided that
            neither such other Parties has authorized or contributed to the
            acts giving rise to the liability.
             
        Each other Party will give the owning or Controlling Party, at the
        owning or Controlling Partys expense, all information and
        assistance reasonably requested by the owning or Controlling Party
        to assist it to initiate, litigate, settle or compromise any
        proceedings in respect of any such infringement or
        misappropriation.
         
        8.3                                 Either FPI or GDLS may initiate
        an action for enforcement of a Joint IP Right. The Party initiating
        the action will bear all costs and control the form and conduct of
        the action. The other owner of such Joint IP Right will cooperate
        in enforcing any Joint IP Right, including, to the extent necessary
        to permit an enforcement action to proceed, joining in such action
        as a party and will not subvert the initiating Partys action by
        granting the accused entity a license under the asserted Joint IP
        Rights. The Party initiating the action may recover all costs from
        any recovery and the balance will be shared equally with the other
        Party.

ARTICLE 9    Representations and Warranties
 
        9.1                                 Each Party hereby represents
        and warrants to the other Parties that it has full authority and
        power to enter into this Agreement and to grant the rights,
        covenants and licenses specified herein, that it has secured any
        and all necessary approvals, permits or consents deemed necessary
        or advisable for the consummation of the transactions contemplated
        hereby, that it is not a party to and will not become a party to
        any agreement with another that is inconsistent with this
        Agreement, and that upon execution by the Party this Agreement will
        immediately be a valid and binding obligation of the Party,
        enforceable in accordance with its terms.
         
        9.2                                 Nothing in this Agreement will

            (a)                                  a warranty or
            representation that anything made, used, sold, or otherwise
            disposed of pursuant to this Agreement or the JV Agreement is
            or will be free from infringement of patents or other

            (b)                                 except as expressly
            provided herein, a requirement that either Party will file any
            patent application, secure any patent, or maintain any patent
            in force; or
             
            (c)                                  an obligation on either
            Party to bring or prosecute actions or suits against third
            parties for infringement of any patent; or
             
            (d)                                 an obligation to furnish
            any Technical Data except as specifically provided herein; or

            of, the other Party;
             
            (f)                                    granting by implication,
            estoppel, or otherwise, any license or right under patents,
            trade secrets, know how, copyrights, or other intangible rights
            of either Party other than as expressly provided herein.
             
        9.3                                 EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH
        IN THIS AGREEMENT, EACH PARTY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTY,
        EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED
        WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR. PURPOSE, AND
        NON-INFRINGEMENT. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT TO THE
        CONTRARY, NEITHER GDLS NOR FPI NOR FDL WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR
        SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR OTHER SIMILAR
        DAMAGES (INCLUDING LOST PROFITS) THAT ANY OTHER PARTY MAY INCUR OR
        EXPERIENCE IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, HOWEVER CAUSED AND
        UNDER WHATEVER THEORY OF LIABILITY,
 
9
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
        EVEN IF SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
        DAMAGES.
         
ARTICLE 10    Restriction on Disclosure
 
        10.1                           Each Party acknowledges that the
        Program contemplates production of a defense article and that
        Background IP and Foreground IP may be subject to applicable
        Federal export and import regulations, including but not limited
        to, the U.S. Arms Export Control Act, as amended (22 U.S.C. §§
        2751-2799), the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, as
        amended (22 C.F.R. Part 120 et seq.), the Export Administration
        Act, as amended, (50 U.S.C. §§ 2401-2420), the U.S. Export

        and the requirements of the National Industrial Security Program

        subcontractors, vendors and suppliers) shall export, disclose,
        furnish or otherwise provide any Background IP, Foreground IP or
        technical information or services relating to the Program to any
        foreign person or entity, whether within the U.S. or abroad,
        without obtaining in advance (if required) appropriate U.S.
        government export authorization.
         
ARTICLE 11    Miscellaneous
 
        11.1                           This Agreement constitutes the
        entire understanding between the Parties with respect to the
        subject matter hereof and supersedes and replaces all prior
        agreements, understandings, writings and discussions between the
        Parties relating to said subject matter.
         
        11.2                           This Agreement may be amended only
        by a written instrument executed by officers of the Parties. The
        failure of either Party at any time or times to require performance
        of any provision thereof will in no manner affect its rights at a
        later time to enforce the same. No waiver by either Party of any
        condition or term in any one or more instance will be construed as
        a further or continuing waiver of such condition or term or any
        other condition or term.
         
        11.3                           Any delay in or failure of
        performance by either Party under this Agreement will not be
        considered a breach of this Agreement if and to the extent caused
        by occurrences beyond the reasonable control of the Party affected,
        including but not limited to acts of God; acts, regulations, or
        laws of any government; strike, or other considered acts of
        workers; fires; floods; explosions; riots; wars; rebellion; and
        sabotage; and any rime for performance hereunder will be extended
        by the actual time of delay caused by such occurrence.
         
        11.4                           All requests and notices required or
        permitted to be given to the Parties hereto will be given in
        writing, will expressly reference the section(s) of this Agreement
        to which they pertain, and will be delivered to the other Party,
        effective on receipt, at the appropriate address as set forth below
        or to such other addresses as may be designated in writing by the
        Parties from time to time during the term of this Agreement.

        11.5                           This Agreement will not be
        assignable by either Party without the other Partys prior written

        that a Party may assign this Agreement to its Affiliate or to a

        hereof, it is the intention of the parties that the remainder of

        which is invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, there be substituted
        or added as part of this Agreement, a provision which will be as
        similar as possible in economic and business objectives as intended
        by the parties to such invalid, illegal, or unenforceable
        provision, but which will be valid, legal, and enforceable.
         
        11.9                           Each Party agrees that after the
