Mortgage Loan only if such  substitution  occurs within two years  following the Closing Date. If a material defect

as to the Mortgage  Loans,  provided  that the Seller shall have the option to  substitute  an Eligible  Substitute
Loan or Loans for such Mortgage Loan only if such substitution occurs within two years following the Closing Date.

contents  of the  related  Mortgage  File shall be vested in the  Purchaser  and the  ownership  of all records and
documents  with respect to the Mortgage  Loans that are prepared by or that come into the  possession of the Seller
or by the Servicer under the Servicing  Agreement shall  immediately  vest in the Purchaser,  and shall be promptly
delivered to the Servicer and retained  and  maintained  in trust by the Servicer  (except for the Mortgage  Notes,
which shall be retained by the  Custodian) at the will of the  Purchaser,  in such  custodial  capacity  only.  The
Seller's records will accurately reflect the sale of each Mortgage Loan sold by it to the Purchaser.

conveyed to it pursuant to this Section 2.1.

respect  to the UCC-1  financing  statements  filed with  respect to the  Mortgage  Loans by the  Purchaser  on the
Closing Date, and any  amendments  thereto  required to reflect a change in the name or corporate  structure of the
Seller or the filing of any additional  UCC-1  financing  statements  due to the change in the principal  office or
jurisdiction  of  incorporation  of the Seller,  as are  necessary to perfect and protect the  Purchaser's  and its
assignees'  interests  in  each  Mortgage  Loan  and the  proceeds  thereof.  The  Servicer  shall  file  any  such
continuation statements on a timely basis.

                  (e) In  connection  with the  assignment  of any Mortgage  Loan  registered  on the MERS® System,
GMACM further agrees that it will cause,  at GMACM's own expense,  as soon as  practicable  after the Closing Date,

Seller on the next  succeeding  Payment  Date,  provided  that a payment at least equal to the  applicable  Monthly
Payment  for such  month  in  respect  of the  Deleted  Loan has been  received  by the  Issuer.  For the  month of

occurred as provided  herein.  In connection  with the  substitution of one or more Eligible  Substitute  Loans for
one or more Deleted  Loans,  the Servicer  shall  determine the amount (such  amount,  a  "Substitution  Adjustment
Amount"),  if any, by which the aggregate principal balance of all such Eligible Substitute Loans as of the date of
substitution  is less than the  aggregate  principal  balance of all such Deleted Loans (after  application  of the
principal  portion of the Monthly Payments due in the month of substitution  that are to be distributed to the Note
Payment  Account in the month of  substitution).  The Seller shall  deposit the amount of such  shortfall  into the
Custodial Account on the date of substitution, without any reimbursement therefor.

         Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  with  respect  to any  Mortgage  Loan  for  which a  breach  of  Section
3.1(b)(xv)  has  occurred,  no  substitutions  will be allowed  unless the Seller pays to the  Servicer,  an amount
sufficient  to indemnify  the Trust Fund,  Purchaser,  Issuer and Indenture  Trustee  against any losses,  damages,
penalties,  fines,  forfeitures,  reasonable and necessary legal fees and related costs, judgments, and other costs
and expenses resulting from any claim,  demand,  defense or assertion based on or grounded upon, or resulting from,
a breach of such representation.

         Upon receipt by the Indenture  Trustee on behalf of the Issuer and the Custodian of written  notification,
signed by a Servicing  Officer,  of the deposit of such  Repurchase  Price or of such  substitution  of an Eligible
Substitute  Loan (together  with the complete  related  Mortgage  File) and deposit of any applicable  Substitution
Adjustment Amount as provided above, the Custodian,  on behalf of the Indenture  Trustee,  shall (i) release to the
Seller the related  Mortgage  Note for the Mortgage  Loan being  repurchased  or  substituted  for,  (ii) cause the
Servicer  to release to the Seller any  remaining  documents  in the  related  Mortgage  File which are held by the
Servicer,  and (iii) the Indenture  Trustee on behalf of the Issuer shall execute and deliver such  instruments  of
transfer or assignment  prepared by the Servicer,  in each case without recourse,  as shall be necessary to vest in
the Seller or its respective  designee such Mortgage Loan released  pursuant  hereto and  thereafter  such Mortgage
Loan shall not be an asset of the Issuer.

         It is  understood  and agreed that the  obligation  of the Seller to cure any breach,  or to repurchase or
substitute  for any Mortgage Loan as to which such a breach has occurred and is  continuing,  shall  constitute the
sole remedy respecting such breach available to the Purchaser,  the Issuer,  the  Certificateholders  (or the Owner
Trustee  on behalf of the  Certificateholders)  and the  Noteholders  (or the  Indenture  Trustee  on behalf of the
Noteholders) against the Seller.

         It is understood and agreed that the  representations  and warranties set forth in this Section 3.1  shall
survive delivery of the respective Mortgage Notes to the Issuer or the Custodian.

         In the event that WG Trust does not comply with its  obligations to repurchase  mortgage loans pursuant to
this  Agreement,  GMACM shall  repurchase any such mortgage loans but only to the extent that WG Trust is obligated
to do so hereunder.

                                                SELLERS' COVENANTS

         Section 4.1       Covenants  of the Seller.  The Seller  hereby  covenants  that,  except for the transfer
hereunder,  it will not sell,  pledge,  assign or transfer to any other Person, or grant,  create,  incur or assume
any Lien on any  Mortgage  Loan,  or any interest  therein.  The Seller shall notify the Issuer (in the case of the
Mortgage Loans,  as assignee of the Purchaser),  of the existence of any Lien (other than as provided above) on any
Mortgage Loan  immediately  upon discovery  thereof;  and the Seller shall defend the right,  title and interest of
the Issuer (in the case of the Mortgage  Loans,  as assignee of the  Purchaser) in, to and under the Mortgage Loans
against all claims of third parties claiming through or under the Seller;  provided,  however, that nothing in this
Section  4.1  shall be  deemed to apply to any Liens for  municipal  or other  local  taxes and other  governmental
charges if such  taxes or  governmental  charges  shall not at the time be due and  payable or if the Seller  shall
currently be contesting the validity thereof in good faith by appropriate Proceedings.

conditions of the  Servicing  Agreement  and the Program  Guide and shall  service the Mortgage  Loans  directly or
through one or more sub-servicers in accordance therewith.

         Section 6.1       Limitation on Liability of the Seller.  None of the  directors,  officers,  employees or
agents of GMACM or WG Trust 2003 shall be under any liability to the  Purchaser or the Issuer,  it being  expressly
understood that all such liability is expressly  waived and released as a condition of, and as  consideration  for,
the  execution  of this  Agreement.  Except as and to the extent  expressly  provided in the  Servicing  Agreement,
GMACM and WG Trust 2003 shall not be under any liability to the Issuer,  the Owner Trustee,  the Indenture  Trustee
or the Securityholders.  GMACM or WG Trust 2003 and any director,  officer,  employee or agent of GMACM or WG Trust
2003 may rely in good faith on any document of any kind prima facie  properly  executed and submitted by any Person
respecting any matters arising hereunder.

or, with respect to any of the foregoing Persons, at such other address as may hereafter be furnished to the
other foregoing Persons in writing.

         Section 8.4       Severability  of  Provisions.  If  any  one  or  more  of  the  covenants,   agreements,
provisions  or terms of this  Agreement  shall be held  invalid  for any reason  whatsoever,  then such  covenants,
agreements,  provisions or terms shall be deemed severable from the remaining covenants, agreements,  provisions or
terms of this Agreement and shall in no way affect the validity of  enforceability  of the other provisions of this
Agreement.

         Section 8.5       Relationship  of Parties.  Nothing  herein  contained  shall be deemed or  construed  to
create a partnership or joint venture among the parties  hereto,  and the services of GMACM shall be rendered as an
independent contractor and not as agent for the Purchaser.

         Section 8.6       Counterparts.  This  Agreement  may be executed in any number of  counterparts,  each of
which, when so executed,  shall be deemed to be an original and such counterparts,  together,  shall constitute one
and the same agreement.

         Section 8.7       Further  Agreements.  The parties  hereto each agree to execute and deliver to the other
such  additional  documents,  instruments  or  agreements  as may be necessary or  appropriate  to  effectuate  the
purposes of this Agreement.

         Section 8.8       Intention  of  the  Parties.  It is  the  intention  of  the  parties  hereto  that  the
Purchaser  will be  purchasing  on the  Closing  Date,  and the Seller  will be selling on the  Closing  Date,  the
Mortgage  Loans,  rather than the  Purchaser  providing a loan to the Seller  secured by the Mortgage  Loans on the
Closing  Date.  Accordingly,  the  parties  hereto  each intend to treat this  transaction  for federal  income tax
purposes as a sale by the Seller,  and a purchase by the  Purchaser,  of the  Mortgage  Loans on the Closing  Date.
The  Purchaser and the Issuer shall each have the right to review the Mortgage  Loans and the Related  Documents to
determine  the  characteristics  of the Mortgage  Loans which will affect the federal  income tax  consequences  of
owning the Mortgage  Loans,  and the Seller shall  cooperate with all reasonable  requests made by the Purchaser or
the Issuer in the course of such review.

         Section 8.9       Successors and Assigns; Assignment of this Agreement.

                  (a) This  Agreement  shall bind and inure to the  benefit of and be  enforceable  by the  parties
hereto and their respective  permitted  successors and assigns.  The obligations of the Seller under this Agreement
cannot be assigned or delegated to a third party  without the consent of the  Purchaser,  which consent shall be at
the Purchaser's sole discretion;  provided,  that the Seller may assign its obligations  hereunder to any Affiliate
of the Seller,  to any Person  succeeding  to the  business  of the Seller,  to any Person into which the Seller is
merged and to any Person  resulting from any merger,  conversion or  consolidation  to which the Seller is a party.
The parties hereto  acknowledge  that the Purchaser is acquiring the Mortgage Loans for the purpose of contributing
them to the GMACM Home Equity Loan Trust 2007-HE3.

                  (b) As an inducement to the Purchaser and the Issuer to purchase the Mortgage  Loans,  the Seller
acknowledges  and consents to (i) the  assignment by the Purchaser to the Issuer of all of the  Purchaser's  rights
against the Seller  pursuant to this Agreement  insofar as such rights relate to the Mortgage Loans  transferred to
the  Issuer  and to the  enforcement  or  exercise  of any right or remedy  against  the  Seller  pursuant  to this
Agreement by the Issuer,  (ii) the  enforcement or exercise of any right or remedy  against the Seller  pursuant to
this  Agreement  by or on behalf of the Issuer and (iii) the Issuer's  pledge of its interest in this  Agreement to
the Indenture  Trustee and the enforcement by the Indenture  Trustee of any such right or remedy against the Seller
following  an Event of Default  under the  Indenture.  Such  enforcement  of a right or remedy by the  Issuer,  the
Owner  Trustee or the Indenture  Trustee,  as  applicable,  shall have the same force and effect as if the right or
remedy had been enforced or exercised by the Purchaser or the Issuer directly.

         Section 8.10      Survival.  The  representations  and  warranties  made  herein  by the  Seller  and  the
provisions of Article VI hereof shall survive the purchase of the Mortgage Loans hereunder.
