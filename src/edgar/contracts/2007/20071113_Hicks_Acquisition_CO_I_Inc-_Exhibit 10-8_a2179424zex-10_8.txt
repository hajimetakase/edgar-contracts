        A.    Organization and Requisite Authority.    The Sponsor is a 
limited partnership duly organized, validly existing and in good standing 
under the laws of the State of Delaware. The Sponsor possesses all 
requisite power and authority necessary to carry out the transactions

        B.    Authorization; No Breach.    

              (i)    This Agreement constitutes a valid and binding

2

------------------------------------------------------------------------

      moratorium and other laws of general applicability relating to or
      affecting creditors' rights and to general equitable principles
      (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or law).

              (ii)   The execution and delivery by the Sponsor of this
      Agreement and the fulfillment of and compliance with the terms hereof
      by the Sponsor does not and shall not as of the Closing Date conflict
      with or result in a breach of the terms, conditions or provisions of
      the organizational documents of the Sponsor or any other agreement,
      instrument, order, judgment or decree to which the Sponsor is
      subject.

        C.    Investment Representations.    

              (i)    The Sponsor is acquiring the Sponsor Warrants and,
      upon exercise of the Sponsor Warrants, the Shares issuable upon such
      exercise (collectively, the "Securities") for its own account, for
      investment purposes only and not with a view towards, or for resale
      in connection with, any public sale or distribution thereof.

              (ii)   The Sponsor is an "accredited investor" as such term
      is defined in Rule 501(a)(3) of Regulation D.

              (iii)  The Sponsor understands that the Securities are being
      offered and will be sold to it in reliance on specific exemptions
      from the registration requirements of the United States federal and
      state securities laws and that the Company is relying upon the truth
      and accuracy of, and the Sponsor's compliance with, the
      representations and warranties of the Sponsor set forth herein in
      order to determine the availability of such exemptions and the
      eligibility of the Sponsor to acquire such Securities.

              (iv)  The Sponsor did not decide to enter into this Agreement
      as a result of any general solicitation or general advertising within
      the meaning of Rule 502(c) under the Securities Act of 1933, as
      amended (the "Securities Act").

              (v)   The Sponsor has been furnished with all materials
      relating to the business, finances and operations of the Company and
      materials relating to the offer and sale of the Securities which have
      been requested by the Sponsor. The Sponsor has been afforded the
      opportunity to ask questions of the executive officers and directors
      of the Company. The Sponsor understands that its investment in the
      Securities involves a high degree of risk and it has sought such
      accounting, legal and tax advice as it has considered necessary to
      make an informed investment decision with respect to the acquisition
      of the Securities.

              (vi)  The Sponsor understands that no United States federal
      or state agency or any other government or governmental agency has
      passed on or made any recommendation or endorsement of the Securities
      or the fairness or suitability of the investment in the Securities by
      the Sponsor nor have such authorities passed upon or endorsed the
      merits of the offering of the Securities.

              (vii) The Sponsor understands that: (a) the Securities have
      not been and are not being registered under the Securities Act or any
      state securities laws, and may not be offered for sale, sold,
      assigned or transferred unless (1) subsequently registered thereunder
      or (2) sold in reliance on an exemption therefrom; and (b) except as
      specifically set forth in the Registration Rights Agreement, neither
      the Company nor any other person is under any obligation to register
      the Securities under the Securities Act or any state securities laws
      or to comply with the terms and conditions of any exemption
      thereunder. In this regard, the Sponsor understands that the
      Securities and Exchange Commission has taken the position that
      promoters or affiliates of a blank check company and their
      transferees, both before and after a Business Combination, are deemed
      to be "underwriters" under the Securities Act when reselling the
      securities of a blank check company. Based on that position, Rule 144
      adopted pursuant to the Securities Act would not be available for
      resale transactions of the Securities despite technical compliance
      with the

3

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      requirements of such Rule, and the Securities can be resold only
      through a registered offering or in reliance upon another exemption
      from the registration requirements of the Securities Act.

              (viii) The Sponsor has such knowledge and experience in
      financial and business matters, knows of the high degree of risk
      associated with investments in the securities of companies in the
      development stage such as the Company, is capable of evaluating the
      merits and risks of an investment in the Securities and is able to
      bear the economic risk of an investment in the Securities in the
      amount contemplated hereunder for an indefinite period of time. The
      Sponsor has adequate means of providing for it or his/her current
      financial needs and contingencies and will have no current or
      anticipated future needs for liquidity which would be jeopardized by
      the investment in the Securities. The Sponsor can afford a complete
      loss of its or his investment in the Securities.

Section 4.    Conditions of the Sponsor's Obligations.

        The obligation of the Sponsor to purchase and pay for the Sponsor 
Warrants is subject to the fulfillment, on or before the Closing Date, of

the Warrant Agreement.

Section 6.    Termination.

        This Agreement may be terminated at any time after [

        All of the representations and warranties contained herein shall

Section 8.    Definitions.

        Terms used but not otherwise defined in this Agreement shall have 
the meaning assigned to such terms in the Registration Statement.

Section 9.    Transfer and Redemption Restrictions.

        A.    In addition to the transfer restrictions set forth in Section 
3, the Sponsor agrees that it shall not sell or transfer the Sponsor 
Warrants or any underlying Shares until the expiration of 180 days from the 
date on which the Company consummates its initial Business Combination, 
meeting the requirements to be set forth in a Registration Statement on 
Form S-1, File No. 143747, and prospectus declared effective by the 
Securities and Exchange Commission, relating to the Public Offering (the "
Registration Statement") and acknowledges that the certificates for the 
Sponsor Warrants and the Shares to be issued upon exercise of the Sponsor 
Warrants shall contain a legend, indicating, among other things, such 
restriction on transferability. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sponsor 
may transfer the Sponsor Warrants or any underlying shares: (i) to the 
Company's officers or directors, any affiliates or family members of any of 
the Company's officers or directors or any affiliates of the Sponsor; (ii) 
by virtue of the laws of the state of Delaware or the Sponsor's limited 
partnership agreement upon dissolution of the Sponsor; (iii) in the event 
of the Company's liquidation prior to its completion of a Business 
Combination; or (iv) the consummation of a liquidation, merger, stock 
exchange or other similar transaction which results in all of the Company's 
stockholders having the right to exchange their shares of Common Stock for 
cash, securities or other property subsequent to the Company's consummation 
of a Business Combination (the "Permitted Transferes"). The Permitted 
Transferees will be subject to the same transfer restrictions set forth in 
this Section 9A. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Business 
Combination" means a business combination with one or more target 
businesses that have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the 
initial amount held in the Trust Account (excluding the amount held in the 
Trust Account representing the underwriters' deferred commission) and the 
term "Trust Account" means the trust account into which a portion of the 
net proceeds of the Company's Public Offering (as described in the 
Registration Statement) will be deposited.

        B.    Each of the Company and the Sponsor hereby acknowledges and 
agrees that, notwithstanding a call for redemption of the Sponsor Warrants 
by the Company in accordance with the terms of the Warrant Agreement, no 
Sponsor Warrants held by the Sponsor or any of its Permitted Transferees at 
the time of such call for redemption shall be redeemable by the Company.

Section 10.    Miscellaneous.

        A.    Successors and Assigns.    Except as otherwise expressly 
provided herein, all covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement 
by or on behalf of any of the parties hereto shall bind and inure to the 
benefit of the respective successors of the parties hereto whether so 
expressed or not. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary 
herein, the parties may not assign this Agreement, other than assignments 
by the Sponsor to affiliates thereof.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

        B.    Severability.    Whenever possible, each provision of this 
Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid 
under applicable law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be 
prohibited by or invalid under applicable law, such provision shall be 
ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without 
invalidating the remainder of this Agreement.

        C.    Counterparts.    This Agreement may be executed 
simultaneously in two or more counterparts, none of which need contain the 
signatures of more than one party, but all such counterparts taken together 
shall constitute one and the same agreement.

        D.    Descriptive Headings; Interpretation.    The descriptive 
headings of this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and do not 
constitute a substantive part of this Agreement. The use of the word 
"including" in this Agreement shall be by way of example rather than by 
limitation.

        E.    Governing Law.    This Agreement shall be deemed to be a 
contract made under the laws of the State of Delaware and for all purposes 
shall be construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of 
Delaware.

        F.    Amendments.    This letter agreement may not be amended, 
modified or waived as to any particular provision, except by a written 
instrument executed by all parties hereto.
