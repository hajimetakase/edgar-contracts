(f/k/a CRC HEALTH GROUP, INC.) (the Borrower), CRC HEALTH GROUP, INC., a 
Delaware corporation, (f/k/a/ CRCA Holdings, Inc.) (Holdings), and the 
Subsidiaries of the Borrower identified therein and CITIBANK, N.A., as 
Collateral Agent for the Secured Parties (as defined below).


A. Reference is made to the Credit Agreement dated as of February 6, 2006; 
as amended and restated as of November 17, 2006 (and as further amended, 
supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the Credit Agreement

Line Lender and L/C Issuer, each Lender from time to time party thereto,

Fenner & Smith Incorporated, as Documentation Agent.


B. Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein shall 
have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Credit Agreement and the 
Security Agreement referred to therein.


C. The Grantors have entered into the Security Agreement in order to induce 
the Lenders to make Loans and the L/C Issuers to issue Letters of Credit. 
Section 7.14 of the Security Agreement provides that additional Restricted 
Subsidiaries of the Borrower may become Subsidiary Parties under the 
Security Agreement by execution and delivery of an instrument in the form 
of this Supplement. The undersigned Restricted Subsidiaries (each a New 
Subsidiary and together, the New Subsidiaries) are executing this 
Supplement in accordance with the requirements of the Credit Agreement to 
become Subsidiary Parties under the Security Agreement in order to induce 
the Lenders to make additional Loans and the L/C Issuers to issue 
additional Letters of Credit and as consideration for Loans previously made 
and Letters of Credit previously issued.


Accordingly, the Collateral Agent and the New Subsidiaries agree as 
follows:

SECTION 1. In accordance with Section 7.14 of the Security Agreement, each 
New Subsidiary by its signature below becomes a Subsidiary Party (and 
accordingly, becomes a Grantor) and Grantor under the Security Agreement 
with the same force and effect as if originally named therein as a 
Subsidiary Party and each New Subsidiary hereby (a) agrees to all the terms 
and provisions of the Security Agreement applicable to it as a Subsidiary 
Party and Grantor thereunder and (b) represents and warrants that the 
representations and warranties made by it as a Grantor thereunder are true 
and correct on and as of the date hereof. In furtherance of the foregoing, 
each New Subsidiary, as security for the payment and performance in full of 
the Obligations does hereby create and grant to the Collateral Agent, its 
successors and assigns, for the benefit of the Secured Parties, their 
successors and assigns, a security interest in and lien on all of such New 
Subsidiarys right, title and interest in and to the Collateral (as defined 
in the Security Agreement) of such New Subsidiary. Each reference to a 
Grantor in the Security Agreement shall be deemed to include each New 
Subsidiary. The Security Agreement is hereby incorporated herein by 
reference.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 2. Each New Subsidiary represents and warrants to the Collateral 
Agent and the other Secured Parties that this Supplement has been duly 
authorized, executed and delivered by it and constitutes its legal, valid 
and binding obligation, enforceable against it in accordance with its 
terms.


SECTION 3. This Supplement may be executed in one or more counterparts, 
each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which when taken 
together shall constitute a single contract. Delivery by telecopier of an 
executed counterpart of a signature page to this Supplement shall be as 
effective as delivery of an original executed counterpart of this 
Supplement. This Supplement shall become effective when the Collateral 
Agent shall have received a counterpart of this Supplement that bears the 
signature of each New Subsidiary and a counterpart hereof shall have been 
executed on behalf of the Collateral Agent, and thereafter shall be binding 
upon such New Subsidiary and the Collateral Agent and their respective 
permitted successors and assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of such 
New Subsidiary, the Collateral Agent and the other Secured Parties and 
their respective successors and assigns, except that the New Subsidiary 
shall not have the right to assign or transfer its rights or obligations 
hereunder or any interest herein or in the Collateral (and any such 
assignment or transfer shall be void) except as expressly contemplated by 
the Security Agreement or the Credit Agreement.


SECTION 4. Each New Subsidiary hereby represents and warrants that (a) set 
forth on Schedule I attached hereto is a true and correct schedule of the 
location of any and all Collateral of the New Subsidiary and (b) set forth 
under its signature hereto is the true and correct legal name of the New 
Subsidiary, its jurisdiction of formation and the location of its chief 
executive office.


SECTION 5. Except as expressly supplemented hereby, the Security Agreement 
shall remain in full force and effect.


SECTION 6. THIS SUPPLEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE 
WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.


SECTION 7. Any provision of this Supplement held to be invalid, illegal or 
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be 
ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or 
unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and 
enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a 
particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate or 
render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. The parties 
shall endeavor in good-faith negotiations to replace the invalid, illegal 
or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of 
which comes as close as possible to that of the invalid, illegal or 
unenforceable provisions.


SECTION 8. All communications and notices hereunder shall be in writing and 
given as provided in Section 7.01 of the Security Agreement.


SECTION 9. The New Subsidiaries agree to reimburse the Collateral Agent for 
its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in connection with this Supplement, 
including the reasonable fees, other charges and disbursements of counsel 
for the Collateral Agent.
