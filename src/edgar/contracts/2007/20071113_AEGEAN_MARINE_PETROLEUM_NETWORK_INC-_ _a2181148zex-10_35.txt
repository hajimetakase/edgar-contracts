    2.10.5      No drawing on the Overdraft Account is permitted if such
    drawing would cause (a) the Overdraft to exceed the Overdraft Facility

    8.2.7.
     
    2.10.6      On the earlier of (a) the date on which the Term Loan is

    for the purpose stated in clause 1.1.3.

    certificate duly signed by an officer of the AMPSA Borrower, certifying
    that the copy of the relevant receipt is true and up to date; and

    2.13         Reset Date
    
    Reset Date shall be each date when the Borrowers, after the Bank has
    served a notice in accordance with clause 8.2.7(a) notifying them of a
    deficiency thereunder, submit a Schedule of Receivables pursuant to
    clause 2.12 in order to remedy the relevant deficiency notified by the
    Bank.
     
    2.14         Issuance of L/Cs
    
    Subject to the fulfilment of the conditions precedent contained in
    clause 9 and the conditions contained in clause 2.15, the Borrowers may
    request the issuance of an L/C by ensuring that the Bank receives a
    completed Issue Request not later than 11.00 a.m. (Piraeus time) two
    (2) Banking Days prior to the intended Issue Date.
    
    2.15         Availability of L/Cs
    
    The conditions referred to in clause 2.14 are that:
    
  2.15.1      an Issue Date has to be a Banking Day during the Availability
  Period;
   
  2.15.2      each L/C shall be denominated in Dollars or in an Optional
  Currency;
   
    2.15.3      the Original Dollar Amount of a L/C shall be not less than
    $1,000,000 (or such other amount as is agreed by the Bank) or such
    other amount as is available in accordance with clause 2.15.4;
   
    2.15.4      the total amount of the Outstandings and the Outstanding
    Amount of the L/C then to be made shall not exceed the lower of:
   
        (a)   the Guarantee Facility Commitment; and
       
        (b)   such amount as shall ensure that the Borrowers are in
        compliance with clauses 8.2.1 and 8.2.7 and shall remain in
        compliance with clauses 8.2.1 and 8.2.7 after the issuance of the
        relevant L/C;
       
  2.15.5      each L/C shall specify an Expiry Date and that Expiry Date
  shall be a date falling not later than the Final Maturity Date; and
   
  2.15.6      no L/C shall be issued unless at least one or more Advances
  have been drawn down.
   
    2.16         Issue Request
    
    2.16.1      Each Issue Request must be signed by a duly authorised
    signatory of the AMPSA Borrower and, once served, the Issue Request
    cannot be revoked without the prior consent of the Bank.
 
30
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
    2.16.2      For the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby agreed and
    acknowledged that, notwithstanding that each L/C issued pursuant to the
    Guarantee Facility may be issued following an Issue Request made by the
    AMPSA Borrower alone, the Guarantee Facility shall be considered as
    made available to both Borrowers jointly and severally and such Issue
    Request shall be binding on both Borrowers in this respect.
    Accordingly, the Borrowers shall be jointly and severally liable for
    the payment and discharge of any obligations and liabilities arising in
    respect of the Guarantee Facility under the terms of this Agreement.
 
    2.17         Issuance of L/C
    
    Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the Bank shall on the
    Issue Date for an L/C, issue the relevant L/C to the relevant
    Beneficiary.
    
    2.18         Weighting of Optional Currency L/Cs
    
    For the purposes of (a) the definition of Actual Exposure in clause
    1.2 and (b) clauses 2.15.4, 8.2.1 and 8.2.7, the Outstanding Amount of
    each Optional Currency L/C and the Original Dollar Amount of any
    Optional Currency L/C shall be multiplied by 110%.
    
    2.19         Extension of Expiry Date
    
    The Borrowers may, by notice in writing to the Bank signed by a duly
    authorised signatory of the Borrowers not later than 11.00 a.m.
    (Piraeus time) five (5) Banking Days prior to the Expiry Date of an
    L/C, request that such Expiry Date be extended. Subject to compliance
    with the following conditions:
    
    2.19.1      the extended Expiry Date shall be a date falling not later
    than the Final Maturity Date;
     
    2.19.2      no Default has occurred and is continuing as at the date on
    which such extension is implemented;
     
    2.19.3      the representations and warranties in clause 7 and those
    (if any) in the Security Documents would be true and not misleading if
    repeated on the date of the request for extension; and
     
    2.19.4      the Bank is satisfied that the test contained in clause
    8.2.7 would not then or in the future be breached by reason of the
    requested extension,
   
    the Bank shall agree to and implement such request by amending and
    re-issuing the relevant L/C.
    
    2.20         Selection of Optional Currencies for L/Cs
    
    2.20.1      If an L/C is to be issued in an Optional Currency, the
    AMPSA Borrower shall specify such Optional Currency in the relevant
    Issue Request submitted in accordance with clause 2.14.
     
    2.20.2      If the AMPSA Borrower fails to specify an Optional
    Currency, it shall be deemed to have specified Dollars for the L/C
    concerned.
   
    2.21         Amount of Optional Currencies
    
    2.21.1      In this clause 2.21, the Banks spot rate of exchange
    means the Banks rate of exchange for the purchase in the London
    Foreign Exchange Market of the appropriate amount of the relevant
    Optional Currency with Dollars at or about 11.00 a.m. on, as the case
    may be, each Issue Date on which an Optional Currency L/C is to be
    issued or on which a previously issued Optional Currency L/C remains
    outstanding, the Settlement Date of an Optional Currency L/C and each
    Reset Date or on any other date when compliance with clause 8.2.1 or
    clause 8.2.7 is tested by the Bank, as relevant (each an L/C Valuation
    Date).
   
    2.21.2      On each L/C Valuation Date the Bank shall determine:
 
31
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
        (a)   in the case of an Issue Date, the Outstanding Amount of each
        Optional Currency L/C then outstanding or to be issued on that L/C
        Valuation Date;
       
        (b)   in the case of a Settlement Date, the Outstanding Amount of
        each relevant Optional Currency L/C; and
       
        (c)   in the case of a Reset Date or any other date when compliance
        with clause 8.2.1 or clause 8.2.7 is tested by the Bank, the
        Outstanding Amount of each Optional Currency L/C then outstanding,
       
      by converting the amount of such L/C in the Optional Currency into
      Dollars on the basis of the Banks spot rate of exchange.
    
    2.21.3      The Bank shall promptly notify the Borrowers of the Banks
    spot rate of exchange (as to which the Banks determination shall, in
    the absence of manifest error, be conclusive) and of the Outstanding
    Amounts hereunder as soon as they are ascertained.
   
    2.22         Reduction of L/Cs
    
    The Outstanding Amount of an L/C shall not be treated as reduced for
    the purposes of this Agreement unless and until:
    
    2.22.1      the Bank has received a written confirmation from the
    Beneficiary of such L/C of the amount of such reduction; or
     
    2.22.2      the Bank has notified the Borrowers in writing that
    (notwithstanding the absence of a written confirmation from the
    Beneficiary of such L/C) it is satisfied that its liability under the
    L/C has been irrevocably reduced or discharged; or
     
    2.22.3      the amount of the L/C irrevocably and unconditionally
    reduces in accordance with its terms; or
     
    2.22.4      the expiry date of the L/C elapses and the Bank has
    notified the Borrowers in writing that it is satisfied that no claim or
    demand has been made, or may thereafter be made, under the L/C.
   
    If the Outstanding Amount of an L/C has been reduced pursuant to this
    clause 2.22, the Outstandings shall be reduced by an equal amount.
    
    2.23         Settlement of L/Cs - non-settlement to constitute loan
    
    2.23.1      The Bank shall, immediately after receiving a demand from,
    or after being notified by, a Beneficiary that it is required to make
    payment under an L/C, notify the Borrowers that such payment is due and
    of the Settlement Amount and the Settlement Date.
     
    2.23.2      The Borrowers shall immediately after notification from the
    Bank under clause 2.23.1 reimburse the Settlement Amount to the Bank by
    payment forthwith to the Bank on the Settlement Date the Settlement
    Amount in Dollars or, if the relevant L/C was issued in an Optional
    Currency, in such Optional Currency.
     
    2.23.3      Each payment of a Settlement Amount made by the Bank to a
    Beneficiary under an L/C and not reimbursed by the Borrowers on the
    relevant Settlement Date in accordance with clause 2.23.2, shall
    constitute a loan advanced by the Bank to the Borrowers jointly and
    severally on the Settlement Date. Each such loan shall be (a) of a
    principal amount equal to the Settlement Amount paid by the Bank to the
    relevant Beneficiary under such L/C, (b) treated as advanced to the
    Borrowers on the relevant Settlement Date and (c) due and repayable by
    the Borrowers to the Bank on the relevant Settlement Date. The
    Borrowers, jointly and severally, hereby undertake with the Bank to
    repay to the Bank each such loan on the date so advanced (or deemed
    advanced) to them pursuant to this clause 2.23.3 (i.e. on the relevant
    Settlement Date).
 
32
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
    2.24         Borrowers undertaking to indemnify
    
    The Borrowers jointly and severally undertake with the Bank that they
    shall indemnify, each as a principal and independent debtor, the Bank
    on demand against all actions, claims, demands, liabilities, costs,
    losses, damages and expenses incurred, suffered or sustained or any
    penalty or other expenditure which may result or which the Bank may
    incur, suffer or sustain in connection with or arising out of or in
    relation to any L/C and/or the payment under or other performance of an
    L/C.
    
    2.25         L/C payments
    
    The Borrowers:
    
    2.25.1      irrevocably authorise the Bank to make any payment demanded
    from it pursuant to an L/C if that demand is made in accordance with
    its terms;
     
    2.25.2      accept that any demand for payment made by the Beneficiary
    pursuant to an L/C and which is made in accordance with its terms shall
    be conclusive evidence that the Bank was liable to make payment under
    that L/C and any payment which the Bank makes pursuant to any such
    demand shall be accepted by the Borrowers as binding upon the
    Borrowers; and
     
    2.25.3      acknowledge and agree that the Bank shall not in any
    circumstances whatsoever be liable to the Borrowers or either of them
    in respect of any loss or damage suffered by the Borrowers or either of
    them by reason of the Bank making a payment to the Beneficiary in
    connection with any payment demanded under an L/C.
   
    2.26         Continuing liabilities
    
    The liabilities and obligations of the Borrowers under clauses 2.23.2
    and 2.24 shall remain in force as a continuing security until:
    
    2.26.1      the full, prompt and complete performance of all the terms
    of such liabilities and obligations including the proper and valid
    payment of all amounts that may become due to the Bank under clauses
    2.22 and 2.24; and
   
    2.26.2      subject to clause 2.27, an absolute discharge or release of
    the Borrowers signed by the Bank,
   
    and accordingly the Borrowers shall not have, as regards those
    liabilities and obligations, any of the rights or defences of a surety.
    
    2.27         Discharges
    
    Any such discharge or release referred to in clause 2.26, and any
    composition or arrangement which the Borrowers may effect with the
    Bank, shall be deemed to be made subject to the condition that it will
    be void if any payment or security which the Bank may previously have
    received or may thereafter receive is set aside under any applicable
    law or proves to have been for any reason invalid.
    
    2.28         No impairment
    
    Without limiting the generality of clauses 2.26 and 2.27, the Borrowers
    shall neither be discharged from any of their liabilities or
    obligations under clauses 2.23.3 and 2.24 by, nor have any claim
    against the Bank in respect of:
    
    2.28.1      any misrepresentation or non-disclosure respecting the
    affairs or condition of the Bank made to the Borrowers or either of
    them by any person; or
   
    2.28.2      a Beneficiary and/or the Bank releasing or granting any
    time or any indulgence whatsoever or making any settlement, composition
    or arrangement with the Borrowers or either of them, a Beneficiary, any
    other Security Party or any other person; or
 
33
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
    2.28.3      a Beneficiary and/or the Bank asserting or pursuing,
    failing or neglecting to assert or pursue, or delaying in asserting or
    pursuing, or waiving, any of their rights or remedies against the
    Borrowers or either of them, a Beneficiary, any other Security Party or
    any other person; or
     
    2.28.4      a Beneficiary and/or the Bank and/or the Borrowers or
    either of them, with the consent of the Borrowers (or with or without
    the consent of the Borrowers in the case of any variation agreed
    between a Beneficiary and the Borrowers or either of them or the person
    whose obligations are guaranteed thereby), making, whether expressly or
    by conduct, any variation to any L/C; or
     
    2.28.5      a Beneficiary and/or the Bank and/or the Borrowers or
    either of them:
   
        (a)   taking, accepting, varying, dealing with, enforcing,
        abstaining from enforcing, surrendering or releasing any security
        in relation to a Beneficiary or the Bank or the Borrowers or either
        of them or any other person in such manner as it or they think fit;
        or
       
        (b)   claiming, proving for, accepting or transferring any payment
        in respect of the obligations and liabilities of the Borrowers or
        either of them and/or a Beneficiary relative to any L/C or under
        this Agreement in any composition by, or winding up of, the
        Borrowers or either of them and/or any third party or abstaining
        from so claiming, proving, accepting or transferring; or
       
    2.28.6      any assignment or transfer by a Beneficiary of, or any
    succession to, any of its rights relative to any L/C.
   
    2.29         Expiry Date after the Final Maturity Date
    
    Without prejudice to the rights of the Bank under clauses 2.15 and
    2.19, if the Bank in its absolute and unfettered discretion, and
    following a relevant request by the Borrowers, agrees to issue an L/C
    with an Expiry Date falling later than the Final Maturity Date, or
    agrees to extend the Expiry Date of an existing L/C beyond the Final
    Maturity Date, the Borrowers hereby jointly and severally undertake
    with the Bank to place funds to the credit of the Cash Collateral
    Account in the currency in which the relevant L/C is denominated and in
    such amount as determined by the Bank in its absolute discretion
    (which, in any event, shall be no less than the Outstanding Amount of
    the relevant L/C).
    
    3              Interest and Interest Periods
    
    3.1           Normal interest rate
    
    3.1.1        Term Loan
   
    The Borrowers shall pay interest on each Tranche in respect of each
    Interest Period relating thereto on each Interest Payment Date for such
    Tranche (or, in the case of Interest Periods of more than three (3)
    months, by instalments, the first three (3) months from the
    commencement of the Interest Period and the subsequent instalments at
    intervals of three (3) months or, if shorter, the period from the date
    of the preceding instalment until the Interest Payment Date relative to
    such Interest Period) at the rate per annum determined by the Bank to
    be the aggregate of (a) the relevant Margin, (b) the Additional Cost
    and (c) LIBOR for such Interest Period.
    
    3.1.2        Overdraft
   
        (a)   The Overdraft shall bear interest calculated on a daily basis
        at the annual rate of interest which is conclusively certified by
        the Bank to the Borrowers to be the aggregate of (a) the relevant
        Margin, (b) the Additional Cost and (c) LIBOR applicable to each of
        the relevant days, and such interest shall be payable quarterly on
        the twentieth (20th) day of March, June, September and December of
        each calendar year (or on such other date or dates as the Bank may
        notify to the Borrowers from time to time) up to the Final Maturity
        Date and on the Final Maturity Date.
 
34
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
        (b)   Interest payments due on the Overdraft shall be made by way
        of debit to the Overdraft Account (at the Banks discretion)
        provided that such debit shall not cause the Overdraft (which for
        these purposes shall include any amount in respect of which the
        AMPSA Borrower has made a drawing request pursuant to clause 2.8)
        to exceed the applicable Overdraft Facility Limit. If interest
        payments due hereunder are not debited to the Overdraft Account as
        permitted by the preceding sentence, the Borrowers shall pay the
        amount thereof to the Bank in cash on the due date.
       
        (c)   The Bank shall advise the AMPSA Borrower of the interest
        rates applied to the Overdraft by bank account statements in
        respect of the Overdraft Account, which the Bank shall send to the
        AMPSA Borrower at the times and in the manner specified in the
        terms and conditions applicable to the Overdraft Account as agreed
        between the Bank and the AMPSA Borrower from time to time.
       
    3.2           Selection of Interest Periods; Term Loan
    
    The Borrowers may by notice received by the Bank not later than 10:00
    a.m. on the second Banking Day before the beginning of each Interest
    Period for a Tranche, specify whether such Interest Period shall have a
    duration of one (1) month, two (2) months, (3) months, six (6) months
    or (subject to availability to be determined by the Bank in its sole
    discretion) twelve (12) months or such other period as the Borrowers
    may select and the Bank may, in its absolute discretion, agree 
    Provided always that if, on any date upon which an Interest Period for
    a Tranche falls to be selected by the Borrowers pursuant to this clause
    3.2, a Transaction or Transactions (which is/are effective or which
    shall become effective during the relevant Interest Period) shall have
    been entered into between the Bank and the Borrowers pursuant to the
    Master Swap Agreement, LIBOR for the Term Loan shall, during the period
    of any such Transaction(s) and for an amount of the Term Loan equal to
    the notional amount of such Transaction(s), be determined by reference
    to the rate for deposits in Dollars displayed on Reuters page LIBOR01
    (British Bankers Association Settlement Rates) in accordance with the
    proviso to paragraph (a) of the definition of LIBOR in clause 1.2 and,
    for the avoidance of doubt, LIBOR for that part of the Term Loan which
    exceeds the notional amount of the Transaction(s) shall be determined
    by reference to the rate for deposits in Dollars referred to in the
    definition of LIBOR in clause 1.2 but excluding the proviso to
    paragraph (a) of such definition.
    
    3.3           Determination of Interest Periods; Term Loan
    
    Every Interest Period in respect of the Term Loan shall be of the
    duration required by, or specified by the Borrowers pursuant to, clause
    3.2 but so that:
    
    3.3.1        the initial Interest Period in respect of each Advance
    shall commence on the Drawdown Date of such Advance and each subsequent
    Interest Period in respect thereof shall commence on the last day of
    the previous Interest Period for such Advance;
   
    3.3.2        the initial Interest Period in respect of each Advance in
    respect of a Newbuilding (after the first Advance to be drawn down in
    respect of such Newbuilding) shall end on the same day as the then
    current Interest Period for the Tranche for such Newbuilding and, on
    the last day of such Interest Period, such Advances shall be
    consolidated into, and shall thereafter constitute, the Tranche in
    respect of such Newbuilding;
   
    3.3.3        if any Interest Period in respect of a Tranche would
    otherwise overrun a Repayment Date for such Tranche, then, in the case
    of the last Repayment Date for such Tranche, such Interest Period shall
    end on such Repayment Date, and in the case of any other Repayment Date
    or Repayment Dates for such Tranche, the relevant Tranche shall be
    divided into parts so that there is one part in the amount of the
    repayment instalment or instalments due on each Repayment Date for such
    Tranche falling during that Interest Period and having an Interest
    Period ending on the relevant Repayment Date and another part in the
    amount of the balance of the relevant Tranche having an Interest Period
    ascertained in accordance with clause 3.2 and the other provisions of
    this clause 3.3; and
 
35
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
    3.3.4        if the Borrowers fail to specify the duration of an
    Interest Period in respect of the Term Loan in accordance with the
    provisions of clause 3.2 and this clause 3.3, such Interest Period
    shall have a duration of three (3) months or such other period as shall
    comply with this clause 3.3.
   
    3.4           Default interest
    
    If the Borrowers fail to pay any sum (including, without limitation,
    any sum payable pursuant to this clause 3.4 and any amounts payable by
    the Borrowers under clause 2.23.3) on its due date for payment under
    any of the Security Documents (other than the Master Swap Agreement),
    the Borrowers shall pay interest on such sum on demand from the due
    date up to the date of actual payment (as well after as before
    judgment) at a rate determined by the Bank pursuant to this clause 3.4.
    The period beginning on such due date and ending on such date of
    payment shall be divided into successive periods of not more than six
    (6) months as selected by the Bank each of which (other than the first,
    which shall commence on such due date) shall commence on the last day
    of the preceding such period. The rate of interest applicable to each
    such period shall be the aggregate (as determined by the Bank) of (a)
    one per cent (1%) per annum, (b) the relevant Margin, (c) the
    Additional Cost and (d) LIBOR for such period or, for any such amounts
    denominated in euros, EURIBOR for such period. Such interest shall be
    due and payable on the last day of each such period as determined by
    the Bank and each such day shall, for the purposes of this Agreement,
    be treated as an Interest Payment Date, provided that, if such unpaid
    sum is an amount of principal which became due and payable by reason of
    a declaration by the Bank under clause 10.2.2 or a prepayment pursuant
    to clauses 4.3, 8.2 or 12.1, on a date other than an Interest Payment
    Date relating thereto, the first such period selected by the Bank shall
    be of a duration equal to the period between the due date of such
    principal sum and such Interest Payment Date and interest shall be
    payable on such principal sum during such period at a rate one per cent
    (1%) above the rate applicable thereto immediately before it shall have
    become so due and payable. If, for the reasons specified in clause
    3.6.1, the Bank is unable to determine a rate in accordance with the
    foregoing provisions of this clause 3.4, interest on any sum not paid
    on its due date for payment shall be calculated at a rate determined by
    the Bank to be one per cent (1%) per annum above the aggregate of the
    relevant Margin and the cost of funds (including Additional Cost) to
    the Bank.
    
    3.5           Notification of Interest Periods and interest rate
    
    The Bank shall notify the Borrowers promptly of the duration of each
    Interest Period in respect of the Term Loan and of each rate of
    interest determined by it under this clause 3 in respect of the Term
    Loan.
    
    3.6           Market disruption; non-availability
    
    3.6.1        If and whenever, at any time prior to the commencement of
    any Interest Period, the Bank shall have determined (which
    determination shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive):
   
        (a)   that adequate and fair means do not exist for ascertaining
        LIBOR or (as the case may be) EURIBOR during such Interest Period;
        or
       
        (b)   that deposits in Dollars or any Optional Currency are not
        available to the Bank in the London Interbank Market or (as the
        case may be) the European Interbank Market in the ordinary course
        of business in sufficient amounts to fund the Loan or (as the case
        may be) the Aggregate Liabilities (or a part thereof) for such
        Interest Period,
       
    the Bank shall forthwith give notice (a Determination Notice) thereof
    to the Borrowers. A Determination Notice shall contain particulars of
    the relevant circumstances giving rise to its issue. After the giving
    of any Determination Notice the undrawn amount of the Commitment and
    the Overdraft Facility shall not be borrowed and no further L/Cs may be
    issued until notice to the contrary is given to the Borrowers by the
    Bank.
    
    3.6.2        During the period of ten (10) days after any Determination
    Notice has been given by the Bank under clause 3.6.1, the Bank shall
    certify an alternative basis (the Substitute Basis) for maintaining
    the Loan or (as the case may be) the Aggregate Liabilities. The
    Substitute Basis
 
36
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
    may (without limitation) include alternative interest periods,
    alternative currencies or alternative rates of interest but shall
    include a margin above the cost of funds, including Additional Cost, if
    any, to the Bank equivalent to the Margin. Each Substitute Basis so
    certified shall be binding upon the Borrowers and shall take effect in
    accordance with its terms from the date specified in the Determination
    Notice until such time as the Bank notifies the Borrowers that none of
    the circumstances specified in clause 3.6.1 continues to exist
    whereupon the normal interest rate fixing provisions of this Agreement
    shall apply.
   
    4              Repayment and prepayment
    
    4.1           Repayment of Term Loan
    
    The Borrowers shall repay each Tranche by forty eight (48) instalments,
    one such instalment to be repaid on each of the Repayment Dates for
    such Tranche. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the amount
    of each of the repayment instalments (other than the last repayment
    instalment) for each Tranche shall be One hundred and forty thousand
    Dollars ($140,000) and the amount of the last repayment instalment for
    each Tranche shall be One hundred thousand Dollars ($100,000). If the
    Commitment in respect of any Tranche or part thereof is not drawn in
    full, the amount of the repayment instalments in respect of the
    relevant Tranche shall be reduced proportionately.
    
    4.2           Voluntary prepayment of Term Loan
    
    The Borrowers may prepay any Tranche in whole or part (being Two
    hundred thousand Dollars ($200,000) or any larger sum which is an
    integral multiple of Two hundred thousand Dollars ($200,000)) on any
    Interest Payment Date relating to the part of the Tranche to be
    prepaid, without premium or penalty.
    
    4.3           Prepayments, reductions and cash-collateralisations on
    Total Loss or demand under Refund Guarantees
    
    4.3.1        Before first drawdown - Newbuildings
   
    On a Newbuilding becoming a Total Loss or suffering damage or being
    involved in an incident which, in the opinion of the Bank, may result
    in such Newbuilding being subsequently determined to be a Total Loss,
    before any Advance for such Newbuilding is drawn down, the obligation
    of the Bank to advance the Tranche (or part thereof) for such
    Newbuilding shall immediately cease and the Commitment shall be reduced
    accordingly.
    
    4.3.2        Before first drawdown - Other Ships
   
    On a Mortgaged Ship (other than a Newbuilding) becoming a Total Loss or
    suffering damage or being involved in an incident which, in the opinion
    of the Bank, may result in that Mortgaged Ship being subsequently
    determined to be a Total Loss, before any Advance is drawn down, the
    Commitment, the Overdraft Facility Limit and the Guarantee Facility
    Commitment will be reduced by such amount (and, in the case of the
    Commitment, in respect of such Advances) as the Bank may in its
    absolute discretion require, and the Banks obligation to make
    available any Advances (or any part thereof) which comprise the part of
    the Commitment that was so cancelled shall immediately cease.
    
    4.3.3        After first drawdown but prior to Delivery - Newbuildings
   
        (a)   On a Newbuilding becoming a Total Loss or suffering damage or
        being involved in an incident which, in the opinion of the Bank,
        may result in such Newbuilding being subsequently determined to be
        a Total Loss, after any Advance for such Newbuilding has been drawn
        down but prior to the drawing of the Delivery Advance for such
        Newbuilding, then:
 
37
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
          (i)    the obligation of the Bank to advance any other Advance
          (or part thereof) for such Newbuilding shall immediately cease
          and the Commitment shall be reduced accordingly; and
          
          (ii)   the Borrowers shall prepay the Pre-delivery Advances for
          such Newbuilding in full; and
          
          (iii)  the Overdraft Facility Limit and the Guarantee Facility
          Commitment shall be reduced by such amounts as the Bank may in
          its absolute discretion require; and
          
          (iv)  the Borrowers shall repay such part of the Overdraft and
          shall place funds to the credit of the Cash Collateral Account in
          such amount and in such currency, as the Bank may in its absolute
          discretion require.
          
        (b)   If a claim is made under any Refund Guarantee and such claim
        is not paid within twenty (20) Banking Days of it being made
        (whether or not such claim has been referred to the appropriate
        courts pursuant to the relevant Refund Guarantee), then:
       
          (i)    the obligation of the Bank to advance any other Advance
          (or any part thereof) for the Newbuilding relevant to such Refund
          Guarantee shall immediately cease; and
          
          (ii)   forthwith on the expiry of such twenty (20) day period,
          the Borrowers shall:
          
            (A)  prepay in full the then outstanding Advances in respect of
            that Newbuilding; and
             
            (B)   the Overdraft Facility Limit and the Guarantee Facility
            Commitment shall be reduced by such amounts as the Bank may in
            its absolute discretion require; and
             
            (C)   the Borrower shall repay such part of the Overdraft and
            shall place funds to the credit of the Cash Collateral Account
            in such amount and in such currency, as the Bank may in its
            absolute discretion require,
             
        Provided however that if the relevant claim made under the Contract
        to which such Refund Guarantee relates has been referred to
        arbitration under the terms of such Contract, the time-limit (and
        the corresponding prepayment obligation of the Borrowers) referred
        to in paragraph (ii) of this clause 4.3.3(b) shall be extended to
        ninety (90) days of the claim under the relevant Refund Guarantee
        being made.
        
    4.3.4        After first drawdown - all Mortgaged Ships
   
    If a Mortgaged Ship becomes a Total Loss after the first Drawdown Date
    under this Agreement, then:
    
        (a)   in the event that such Mortgaged Ship is a Newbuilding, the
        Borrowers shall prepay the Tranche for such Newbuilding in full on
        the Reduction Date for such Newbuilding; and
       
        (b)   forthwith after the occurrence of such Total Loss, the
        Overdraft Facility Limit and the Guarantee Facility Commitment
        shall be reduced by such amounts as the Bank may in its absolute
        discretion require; and
         
        (c)   forthwith following the Banks request, the Borrowers shall
        repay such part of the Overdraft and the Tranches (and in such
        manner as between them), and shall place funds to the credit of the
        Cash Collateral Account in such amount and in such currency, as the
        Bank may in its absolute discretion require.
       
    For the purposes of this clause 4.3.4, Reduction Date means, in
    relation to a Mortgaged Ship which has become a Total Loss, the date
    falling one hundred and twenty (120) days after the date when such Ship
    became a Total Loss or, if earlier, the date when insurance proceeds in
 
38
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
    respect of such Total Loss are, or Requisition Compensation for such
    Ship is, received by the relevant Owner (or the Bank pursuant to the
    Ship Security Documents).
    
    4.3.5        Interpretation
   
    For the purpose of this Agreement, a Total Loss in respect of a Ship
    shall be deemed to have occurred:
    
        (a)   in the case of an actual total loss of a Ship, on the actual
        date and at the time such Ship was lost or, if such date is not
        known, on the date on which such Ship was last reported;
       
        (b)   in the case of a constructive total loss of a Ship, upon the
        date and at the time notice of abandonment of such Ship is given to
        the insurers of such Ship for the time being;
       
        (c)   in the case of a compromised or arranged total loss of a
        Ship, on the date upon which a binding agreement as to such
        compromised or arranged total loss has been entered into by the
        insurers of such Ship;
       
        (d)   in the case of Compulsory Acquisition of such Ship, on the
        date upon which the relevant requisition of title or other
        compulsory acquisition occurs; and
       
        (e)   in the case of hijacking, theft, condemnation, capture,
        seizure, arrest, detention or confiscation of a Ship (other than
        where the same amounts to Compulsory Acquisition of such Ship) by
        any Government Entity, or by persons purporting to act on behalf of
        any Government Entity, which deprives the relevant Owner (or, in
        the case of a Newbuilding prior to its Delivery, the Builders) of
        the use of such Ship for more than thirty (30) days, upon the
        expiry of the period of thirty (30) days after the date upon which
        the relevant hijacking, theft, condemnation, capture, seizure,
        arrest, detention or confiscation occurred.
       
    4.4           Amounts payable on prepayment - Term Loan
    
    Any prepayment of all or part of the Term Loan under this Agreement
    shall be made together with (a) accrued interest on the amount to be
    prepaid to the date of such prepayment, (b) any additional amount
    payable under clauses 6.6 or 12.2 and (c) all other sums payable by the
    Borrowers to the Bank under this Agreement or any of the other Security
    Documents including, without limitation, any accrued commitment
    commission or guarantee commission payable under clause 5.1 and any
    amounts payable under clause 11.
    
    4.5           Notice of prepayment; reduction of repayment instalments
    - Term Loan
    
    4.5.1        No prepayment of the Term Loan may be effected under
    clause 4.2 unless the Borrowers shall have given the Bank at least
    fourteen (14) days notice of their intention to make such prepayment.
    Every notice of prepayment shall be effective only on actual receipt by
    the Bank, shall be irrevocable, shall specify the Tranche and the
    amount thereof to be prepaid and shall oblige the Borrowers to make
    such prepayment on the date specified.
   
    4.5.2        Any amount of the Term Loan prepaid pursuant to clause 4.2
    in respect of a Tranche shall be applied in reducing the repayment
    instalments of the relevant Tranche under clause 4.1 in inverse order
    of their due dates for payment.
     
    4.5.3        Any amount of the Term Loan prepaid pursuant to clause
    8.2.1(a) shall be applied in prepayment of all Tranches proportionately
    as between them and in reduction of the repayment instalments of each
    Tranche in inverse order of their due dates for payment.
     
    4.5.4        The Borrowers may not prepay the Term Loan or any part
    thereof save as expressly provided in this Agreement. No amount prepaid
    under this Agreement may be re-borrowed.

    4.6           Master Swap Agreement, repayments and prepayments of Term
    Loan
    
    4.6.1        Notwithstanding any provision of the Master Swap Agreement
    to the contrary, in the case of a prepayment of all or part of the Term
    Loan (including, without limitation, following the occurrence of a
    Total Loss in accordance with clause 4.3 or under clauses 8.2.1(a) or
    12.1) then, subject to clause 4.6.2, the Bank shall be entitled but not
    obliged (and, where relevant, may do so without the consent of the
    Borrowers, where it would otherwise be required whether under the
    Master Swap Agreement or otherwise) to amend, supplement, cancel, net
    out, terminate, liquidate, transfer or assign all or any part of the
    rights, benefits and obligations created by any Transaction and/or the
    Master Swap Agreement and/or to obtain or re-establish any hedge or
    related trading position in any manner and with any person the Bank in
    its absolute discretion may determine and both the Banks and the
    Borrowers continuing obligations under any Transaction and/or the
    Master Swap Agreement shall, unless agreed otherwise by the Bank, be
    calculated so far as the Bank considers it practicable by reference to
    the amended repayment schedule for the Term Loan taking into account
    the fact that less than the full amount of the Term Loan remains
    outstanding.
     
    4.6.2        If less than the full amount of the Term Loan remains
    outstanding following a prepayment under this Agreement and the Bank in
    its absolute discretion agrees, following a written request of the
    Borrowers, that the Borrowers may be permitted to maintain all or part
    of a Transaction in an amount not wholly matched with or linked to all
    or part of the Term Loan, the Borrowers shall, within ten (10) days of
    being notified by the Bank of such requirement, provide the Bank with,
    or procure the provision to the Bank of, such additional security as
    shall in the opinion of the Bank be adequate to secure the performance
    of such Transaction, which additional security shall take such form, be
    constituted by such documentation and be entered into between such
    parties, as the Bank in its absolute discretion may approve or require,
    and each document comprising such additional security shall constitute
    a Credit Support Document.
     
    4.6.3        The Borrowers shall on the first written demand of the
    Bank indemnify the Bank in respect of all losses, costs and expenses
    (including, but not limited to, legal costs and expenses) incurred or
    sustained by the Bank as a consequence of or in relation to the
    effecting of any matter or transactions referred to in this clause 4.6.
     
    4.6.4        Notwithstanding any provision of the Master Swap Agreement
    to the contrary, if for any reason a Transaction has been entered into
    but no Advance is drawn down under this Agreement then, subject to
    clause 4.6.5, the Bank shall be entitled but not obliged (and, where
    relevant, may do so without the consent of the Borrowers where it would
    otherwise be required whether under the Master Swap Agreement or
    otherwise) to amend, supplement, cancel, net out, terminate, liquidate,
    transfer or assign all or any part of the rights, benefits and
    obligations created by such Transaction and/or the Master Swap
    Agreement and/or to obtain or re-establish any hedge or related trading
    position in any manner and with any person the Bank in its absolute
    discretion may determine.
     
    4.6.5        If a Transaction has been entered into but no Advance is
    drawn down under this Agreement and the Bank in its absolute discretion
    agrees, following a written request of the Borrowers, that the
    Borrowers may be permitted to maintain all or part of a Transaction,
    the Borrowers shall, within ten (10) days of being notified by the Bank
    of such requirement, provide the Bank with, or procure the provision to
    the Bank of, such additional security as shall in the opinion of the
    Bank be adequate to secure the performance of such Transaction, which
    additional security shall take such form, be constituted by such
    documentation and be entered into between such parties, as the Bank in
    its absolute discretion may approve or require, and each document
    comprising such additional security shall constitute a Credit Support
    Document for the purposes of the Master Swap Agreement and/or
    otherwise.
     
    4.6.6        Without prejudice to or limitation of the obligations of
    the Borrowers under clause 4.6.3, in the event that the Bank exercises
    any of its rights under clauses 4.6.1, 4.6.2, 4.6.4 or 4.6.5 and such
    exercise results in all or part of a Transaction being terminated, such
    termination shall be treated under the Master Swap Agreement in the
    same manner as if it were a Terminated Transaction (as defined in
    section 14 of the Master Swap Agreement) effected by the Bank after an
    Event of Default (as so defined in that section 14) by the Borrowers
    and, accordingly, the Bank shall be
 
40
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
    permitted to recover from the Borrowers a payment for early termination
    calculated in accordance with the provisions of section 6(e)(i) of the
    Master Swap Agreement.

    payment shall be increased to the extent necessary to ensure that,
    after the making of such deduction or withholding, the Bank receives on
    the due date for such payment (and retains, free from any liability in

    this Agreement, relating to, or arising directly or indirectly in any
    manner or for any cause or reason whatsoever out of an Environmental
    Claim made or asserted against the Bank if such Environmental Claim

    reasonable and documented)  arising from any failure of either Borrower
    to perform or discharge any purported obligation or liability of the
    other Borrower which would have been the subject of this Agreement or
    the Master Swap Agreement or any other Security Document had it been
    valid and enforceable and which is not or ceases to be valid and
    enforceable against a Borrower on any ground whatsoever, whether or not
    known to the Bank (including, without limitation, any irregular
    exercise or absence of any corporate power or lack of authority of, or
    breach of duty by, any person purporting to act on behalf of a Borrower
    (or any legal or other limitation, whether under the Limitation Acts or
    otherwise or any disability or death, bankruptcy, unsoundness of mind,
    insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, winding up, administration,
    receivership, amalgamation, reconstruction or any other incapacity of

    None of the obligations or liabilities of a Borrower under this
    Agreement or the Master Swap Agreement or any other Security Document

        receivership, amalgamation, reconstruction or other incapacity of

        termination or change in the composition of the partnership) or any
        change of name or style or constitution of the other Borrowers or
        either of them or any other person liable;
       
        (b)         the Bank granting any time, indulgence or concession
        to, or compounding with, discharging, releasing or varying the
        liability of, the other Borrower or any other person liable or
        renewing, determining, varying or increasing any accommodation,
        facility or transaction or otherwise dealing with the same in any
        manner whatsoever or concurring in, accepting, varying any
        compromise, arrangement or settlement or omitting to claim or
        enforce payment from the other Borrower or any other person liable;
        or
 
73
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
        (c)          anything done or omitted which but for this provision
        might operate to exonerate the Borrowers or either of them.
       
    16.4.5                  Recourse to other security
   
    The Bank shall not be obliged to make any claim or demand or to resort
    to any Security Document or other means of payment now or hereafter
    held by or available to it for enforcing this Agreement or the Master
    Swap Agreement or any of the Security Documents against a Borrower or
    any other person liable and no action taken or omitted by the Bank in
    connection with any such Security Document or other means of payment
    will discharge, reduce, prejudice or affect the liability of the
    Borrowers under this Agreement, the Master Swap Agreement and the
    Security Documents to which any of them is, or is to be, a party.
    
    16.4.6                  Waiver of Borrowers rights
   
    Each Borrower agrees with the Bank that, from the date of this
    Agreement and so long as any moneys are owing under any of the Security
    Documents and/or the Master Swap Agreement and while all or any part of
    the Commitment remains outstanding, it will not, without the prior
    written consent of the Bank:
    
        (a)          exercise any right of subrogation, reimbursement and
        indemnity against the other Borrower or any other person liable
        under the Security Documents;
       
        (b)         demand or accept repayment in whole or in part of any
        Indebtedness now or hereafter due to such Borrower from the other
        Borrower or from any other person liable or demand or accept any
        guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against financial loss or
        any document or instrument created or evidencing an Encumbrance in
        respect of the same or dispose of the same;
       
        (c)          take any steps to enforce any right against the other
        Borrower or any other person liable in respect of any such moneys;
        or
       
        (d)         claim any set-off or counterclaim against the other
        Borrower or any other person liable or claiming or proving in
        competition with the Bank in the liquidation of the other Borrower
        or any other person liable or have the benefit of, or share in, any
        payment from or composition with, the other Borrower or any other
        person liable or any other Security Document now or hereafter held
        by the Bank for any moneys owing under this Agreement and/or the
        Master Swap Agreement or for the obligations or liabilities of any
        other person liable but so that, if so directed by the Bank, it
        will prove for the whole or any part of its claim in the
        liquidation of the other Borrower or other person liable on terms
        that the benefit of such proof and all money received by it in
        respect thereof shall be held on trust for the Bank and applied in
        or towards discharge of any moneys owing under this Agreement
        and/or the Master Swap Agreement in such manner as the Bank shall
        deem appropriate.

    16.5.1                  Each Borrower shall be entitled to rights of
    contribution as against the other Borrower, however, such rights of
    contribution shall (a) not in any way (except as otherwise expressly
    set forth in clause 16.5.2 below) condition or lessen the liability of
    each Borrower as a joint and several borrower for the whole of the
    obligations owed to the Bank hereunder, and under the Security
    Documents and (b) shall be fully subject and subordinate to the rights
    of the Bank against the Borrowers hereunder, and under the Security
    Documents.
   
    16.5.2                  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
    contained in this Agreement, or any of the Security Documents, in the
    event that any court or other judicial body of competent jurisdiction
    determines that legal principles of fraudulent conveyances, fraudulent
    transfers or similar concepts are applicable in evaluating the
    enforceability against any particular Borrower or its assets of this
    Agreement or any Security Document granted by such Borrower as security
    for its obligations hereunder and that under such principles, this
    Agreement or such other Security Documents would not be enforceable
    against such Borrower or its asset unless the following provisions of
    this clause 16.5.2 had effect, then, the maximum liability of such
    Borrower hereunder (the
 
74
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
    Maximum Liability Amount) shall be limited such that in no event
    shall such amount exceed the lesser of (i) the obligations of such
    Borrower hereunder (in the principal amount of up to $183,400,000, plus
    interest, expenses, fees and any amounts owing under the Master Swap
    Agreement), and (ii) an amount equal to the aggregate, without double
    counting, of (a) ninety-five percent (95%) of such Borrowers Adjusted
    Net Worth (as hereinafter defined) on the date hereof, on the date of
    commencement of a case under the Bankruptcy Code of the United States
    of America, as amended (11 U.S.C. ss 101-1330) (the Bankruptcy Code)
    or any similar legislation in any other jurisdiction, in which such
    Borrower is a debtor, or on the date enforcement of this Agreement is
    sought (the Determination Date), whichever is greater, (b) the
    aggregate fair value of such Borrowers Subrogation and Contribution
    Rights (as hereinafter defined) and (c) the amount of any Valuable
    Transfer (as hereinafter defined) to such Borrower; provided that each
    Borrowers liability under this Agreement shall further be limited to
    the extent, if any, required so that the obligations of each Borrower
    under this Agreement shall not be subject to avoidance under Section
    548 of the Bankruptcy Code or any similar provision under the
    legislation of any other relevant jurisdiction, or to being set aside
    or annulled under any applicable law relating to fraudulent transfers
    or fraudulent conveyances. In determining the limitations, if any, on
    the amount of either Borrowers obligations hereunder pursuant to the
    preceding sentence, any rights of subrogation or contribution
    (collectively the Subrogation and Contribution Rights) which such
    Borrower may have on the Determination Date with respect to the Funding
    Borrower (as hereinafter defined) under applicable law shall be taken
    into account.
   
    16.5.3                  As used herein Adjusted Net Worth of each
    Borrower shall mean, as of any date of determination thereof, an amount
    equal to the lesser of (a) an amount equal to the excess of (i) the
    amount of the present fair saleable value of the assets of such
    Borrower over (ii) the amount that will be required to pay such
    Borrowers probable liability on its then existing debts, including
    contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and matured, and (b) an
    amount equal to the excess of (i) the sum of such Borrowers property
    at a fair valuation over (ii) the amount of all liabilities of such
    Borrower, contingent or otherwise, as such terms are construed in
    accordance with applicable federal and state laws in the United States
    of America, or the laws of other applicable jurisdictions, governing
    determinations of the insolvency of debtors.
   
    16.5.4                  In determining the Adjusted Net Worth of each
    Borrower for purposes of calculating the Maximum Liability Amount for
    such Borrower, the liabilities of such Borrower to be used in such
    determination pursuant to each section (ii) of clause 17.6.3 shall in
    any event exclude (a) the liabilities of such Borrower under this
    Agreement, (b) any liabilities of such Borrower subordinated in right
    of payment to this Agreement and (c) any liabilities of such Borrower
    for Subrogation and Contribution Rights to the other Borrower.
     
    16.5.5                  As used herein Valuable Transfer shall mean,
    in respect of each Borrower, (a) all loans, advances or capital
    contributions made to such Borrower with proceeds of the Loan made
    under this Agreement, (b) all debt securities or other obligations of
    such Borrower acquired from such Borrower or retired by such Borrower
    with proceeds of the Loan made under this Agreement and transferred,
    absolutely and not as collateral, to such Borrower (c) the fair market
    value of all property acquired with proceeds of the Loan made under
    this Agreement and transferred, absolutely and not as collateral, to
    such Borrower, (d) all equity securities of such Borrower acquired from
    such Borrower with proceeds of the Loan made under this Agreement and
    (e) the value of any other economic benefits in accordance with
    applicable federal and state laws, or the laws of other applicable
    jurisdictions, governing determinations of the insolvency of debtors,
    in each case accruing to such Borrower as a result of the Loan made
    available under this Agreement.
     
    16.5.6                  Without in any way modifying or affecting the
    obligations of either of the Borrowers hereunder, in the event either
    of the Borrowers shall make any payment or payments to the Bank under
    this Agreement in an aggregate amount in excess of such Borrowers
    Percentage (such Borrower hereinafter called the Funding Borrower and
    the other Borrower hereinafter called the Other Borrower), the Other
    Borrower shall contribute to the Funding Borrower an amount equal to
    the Other Borrowers Percentage of such payment or payments made by the
    Funding Borrower. For the purposes hereof, a Funding Borrowers or the
    Other Borrowers Percentage shall be determined as of the date on which
    such payment was made by reference to the ratio of (a) such Funding
