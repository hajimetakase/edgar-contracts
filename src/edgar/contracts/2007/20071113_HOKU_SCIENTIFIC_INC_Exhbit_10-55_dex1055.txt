AGREEMENT

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and for good and 
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby 
acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound, the parties hereto agree 
as follows:

1. Consent and Agreements.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Consent, the Contracting 
Party acknowledges and consents to the assignment as collateral security to 
the Agent, for the benefit of the Secured Parties, of the Assigned 
Interests. The Contracting Party further acknowledges the right of Agent or 
any designee of Agent, in exercise of Agents rights and remedies as a 
secured creditor of Borrower, to make all demands, give all notices, take 
all actions and exercise all rights of Borrower under the Contract.

(b) The Agent shall be entitled (but not obligated) to cure any defaults of 
the Borrower under the Contract in accordance with the provisions hereof. 
Upon receipt by the Contracting Party of written notice from the Agent, the 
Contracting Party agrees to (i) accept such cure by the Agent and, subject 
to the terms and conditions of the Contract and cure of such defaults, to 
render to the Secured Parties all performance due by it under the Contract 
and this Consent, and (ii) act solely on the instructions of the Agent, not 
the Borrower, with respect to the exercise of the Borrowers rights under 
the relevant Contract. The Contracting Party agrees to make all payments to 
be made by it under the Contract directly to the Agent for the benefit of 
the Secured Parties upon receipt of the Agents written instructions to do 
so and any such payments made to the Agent by the Contracting Party shall 
be deemed to have been made by the Contracting Party in fulfillment of the 
Contracting Partys obligations to the Borrower under the Contract.

(c) In all cases except as provided in the Contract or required by law, and 
in accordance with Section 1(e) hereof, the Contracting Party will not, 
without the prior written consent of the Agent (such consent not to be 
unreasonably withheld), (i) cancel or terminate the Contract or suspend 
performance of its services thereunder, or consent to or accept any 
cancellation, termination or suspension thereof by the Borrower, (ii) amend 
the Contract [NOTE: Exceptions will be limited to Change Orders otherwise 
permitted under the Credit Agreement], or (iii) sell, assign or otherwise 
dispose (by operation of law or otherwise) of any part of its rights, title 
or interest in the Contract. The Contracting Party agrees to deliver copies 
of all notices of default, notices of the suspension of performance by

Contracting Party, notices of force majeure or requests for change orders 
delivered by Contracting Party to Borrower under or pursuant to the 
Contract to the Agent promptly upon delivery thereof.

(d) The Contracting Party will not terminate or suspend performance of the 
Contract on account of any default or breach of the Borrower thereunder 
without written notice to the Agent and first providing to the Agent (i) 30 
days from the date notice of default or breach is delivered to the Agent to 
cure such default if such default is the failure to pay amounts to the 
Contracting Party which are due and payable under the Contract, or (ii) a 
reasonable period, but not fewer than 60 days, to cure such breach or 
default if the breach or default cannot be cured by the payment of money to 
the Contracting Party so long as the Agent, the Borrower or their 
respective designee shall have commenced to cure the breach or default 
promptly following such notice and in any case within such 60-day period 
and thereafter diligently pursues such cure to completion (but in any event 
within not more than 120 days) and during such cure period performs all 
monetary obligations under the Contract and all other obligations under the 
Contract are performed by the Borrower or the Agent or their respective 
designees. For the avoidance of doubt and solely for the purposes of the 
preceding sentence, amounts not paid and subject to a dispute in good faith 
by the Borrower shall not be deemed to be a payment default. The 
Contracting Party shall not hinder the Agents or its designees efforts, 
and shall provide reasonable cooperation to the Agent and its designees, in 
effecting any cure of any default or breach of the Borrower under the 
Contract. Except in the event of a payment default under the Contract, if 
possession of the Project is necessary to cure such breach or default, and 
the Agent or its designees or assignees declares the Borrower in default 
under the Credit Agreement and within the 60-day period described above 
commences foreclosure proceedings, the Agent or its designees or assignees 
shall be allowed a reasonable period to complete such proceedings so long 
as (A) the Agent proceeds diligently and in good faith to do so and during 
such period performs all monetary obligations under the Contract, and (B) 
all other obligations under the relevant Contract are performed by the 
Borrower or the Agent or their respective designees. If the Agent or its 
designees or assignees are prohibited by any court order or bankruptcy or 
insolvency proceedings from curing the default or from commencing or 
prosecuting foreclosure proceedings, the foregoing time periods shall be 
extended by the period of such prohibition so long as (1) the Agent 
proceeds diligently and in good faith to address such impediments and 
during such period performs all monetary obligations under the Contract, 
and (2) all other obligations under the Contract are performed by the 
Borrower or the Agent or their respective designees. The Contracting Party 
consents to the transfer of the Borrowers interest under each Contract to 
the Agent or any purchaser, successor, assignee and/or designee (a 
Subsequent Transferee) of the Assigned Interests at a foreclosure sale by 
judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure and sale or by a conveyance by the 
Borrower in lieu of foreclosure and agrees that, notwithstanding

any provision of the Contract to the contrary, upon such foreclosure, sale 
or conveyance, the Agent or such Subsequent Transferee shall be substituted 
for the Borrower under the Contract and the Contracting Party (a) shall 
recognize the Agent or the Subsequent Transferee, as the case may be, as 
its counter-party under the Contract, and (b) perform its obligations under 
the Contract in favor of the Agent or the Subsequent Transferee, as the 
case may be; provided that the Agent or such Subsequent Transferee (i) has 
elected to assume the rights and obligations of the Borrower (including the 
obligation to cure any then existing payment and performance defaults, but 
excluding any obligation to cure any then existing performance defaults 
which by their nature are incapable of being cured and which default that 
is incapable of being cured does not materially and adversely affect the 
rights of the Contracting Party under the Contract) under the Contract, and 
(ii) would reasonably be expected to have the capability to perform the 
Borrowers obligations under the Contract.

(e) Subject to payment of all amounts due and unpaid to the Contracting 
Party and cure of all then existing payment and performance defaults, but 
excluding any obligation to cure any then existing performance defaults 
which by their nature are incapable of being cured and which default that 
is incapable of being cured does not materially and adversely affect the 
rights of the Contracting Party under the Contract, in the event the 
Contract is rejected or terminated by a trustee or debtor in possession in 
any bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding, or if the Contract is terminated 
for any reason other than a default which could have been but was not cured 
by the Agent as provided in Section 1(e) hereof, and if, within 45 days 
after such rejection or termination, the Agent shall so request, the 
Contracting Party shall execute and deliver to the Agent a new Contract 
having substantially identical terms to the Contract (subject to any 
conforming changes necessitated by the substitution of parties and such 
changes as may be necessary to compensate the Contracting Party for 
schedule and cost adjustments resulting from the passage of time).

(f) In the event the Agent or its designees or assignees elect to perform 
the Borrowers obligations under a Contract or a new Contract is entered 
into as provided above in Sections 1(e) or (f), respectively, the liability 
of the Agent, or its designees or assignees, as the case may be, to the 
Contracting Party for the performance of obligations under such Contract, 
and the sole recourse of the Contracting Party in seeking the enforcement 
of such obligations, shall be limited to such parties rights, title and 
interest in the Project.

(g) Except as provided in Sections 1(e), (f) and (g) above, neither the 
Agent, its designees or assignees shall have any obligation or liability 
under the Contract, nor shall the Agent, its designees or assignees be 
obligated to perform any of the obligations or duties of the Borrower under 
the Contract or to take any action or collect or enforce any claim for 
payment or performance of the Assigned Interests. Within 30 or 60 days, as

being notified by the Contracting Party that a Borrower default or breach 
has occurred under the Contract, the Agent shall notify the Contracting 
Party of its intent whether or not to cure any such Borrower default or 
breach. In the event the Agent fails to notify the Contracting Party within 
the time period described in the foregoing sentence that the Agent will 
cure such default or breach, the Contracting Party shall be entitled to 
assume that the Agent has elected not to cure such default or breach and 
the Contracting Party may then exercise all rights that the Contracting 
Party would have under the Contract, without regard to the provisions of 
this Consent. In the absence of such notice, no performance by the Agent, 
its designees or assignees under or pursuant to this Consent or otherwise 
(whether to cure a Borrower default or exercise rights under any provision 
hereof or otherwise) shall be construed as an assumption by the Agent, its 
designees or assignees of the obligations and duties of the Borrower under 
the Contract, unless otherwise expressly agreed in writing by the Agent, 
its assignees or designees, as the case may be. The Agent shall have the 
right to assign all or a pro rata interest in a Contract or a new Contract 
entered into pursuant to Section 1(f) to a person or entity to whom the 
Project is transferred, provided such transferee (i) assumes the 
obligations of the Borrower (or the Secured Parties) under such Contract 
and cure of any material defaults under such Contract has been effected as 
provided herein, and (ii) would reasonably be expected to have the 
capability to perform the Borrowers obligations under such Contract. Upon 
such assignment, the Agent and the Secured Parties (including their agents 
and employees) shall be released from any further liability thereunder to 
the extent of the interest assigned.


2. Borrowers Acknowledgment. The Borrower acknowledges and agrees that the 
Contracting Party is authorized to act in accordance with the Agents 
exercise of the Borrowers rights in accordance with this Consent, and the 
Contracting Party may rely on any notice or instruction by the Agent in the 
purported exercise of the Agents rights and remedies hereunder.


3. Legal Opinion. The Contracting Party hereby agrees to deliver to the 
Agent a legal opinion (which may be from a senior in-house counsel), dated 
as of the dated hereof, substantially in form attached hereto as Exhibit A.


4. Payment of Monies. The Contracting Party hereby agrees to make all 
payments to be made by it to the Borrower under the Contract by wire 
transfer directly to:

Agreement has occurred and is continuing, the Contracting Party shall make 
all payments to be made by it to the Borrower under the Contract directly

designated by the Agent in such written notice, and (ii) if any person has 
elected to become a Subsequent Transferee, then the Contracting Party shall 
make all payments to be made by it to the Borrower under the Contract 
directly to such Subsequent Transferee. Any payments made by the 
Contracting Party as provided under this Section 4 shall be deemed to have 
been made by the Contracting Party in fulfillment of the Contracting 
Partys obligations under the Contract.


5. Representations and Warranties. The Contracting Party hereby represents 
and warrants, for the benefit of the Agent and the Secured Parties, as of

CONFIDENTIAL
 
(b) the execution, delivery and performance by the Contracting Party of the 
Contract and this Consent have been duly authorized by all necessary 
corporate action, and do not and will not require any further consents or 
approvals which have not been obtained, or violate any provision of any 
law, regulation, order, judgment, injunction or similar matters or breach 
any agreement presently in effect with respect to or binding on the 
Contracting Party, except for such breaches, defaults, or violations as 
will not, either individually or in the aggregate, result in a material 
adverse effect on the ability of the Contracting Party to perform its 
obligations under this Consent or the Contract;

(c) each of this Consent and the Contract constitutes legal, valid and 
binding obligations of the Contracting Party, enforceable against the 
Contracting Party in accordance with their respective terms, except to the 
extent that enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, 
insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or other similar laws affecting the 
enforcement of creditors rights or by the effect of general equitable 
principles (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a 
proceeding in equity or at law);

(d) no authorizations, approvals or consents of any governmental or 
regulatory authority or agency or any other person, and no filings or 
registrations with any governmental authority or agency, are necessary for 
the execution, delivery or performance by the Contracting Party of this 
Consent, or for the validity or enforceability thereof, except for any 
authorizations, approvals, consents or filings which (i) have been made or 
obtained prior to the date hereof and are in full force and effect, or (ii) 
are obtainable in the ordinary course of business and are set forth on 
Exhibit B to this Consent;

(e) except pursuant to this Consent and as expressly set forth in the 
Contract, the Contracting Party has not consented to any pledge, assignment 
or other transfer of any interest in the Contract;

(f) the Contract is in full force and effect and has not been amended, 
supplemented or modified (except as otherwise disclosed in writing to the 
Agent); and

(g) the Borrower has fulfilled all of its material obligations which are 
currently due under the Contract, and there are no breaches or unsatisfied 
conditions presently existing (or which would exist after the passage of 
time and/or giving of notice) that would allow the Contracting Party to 
terminate the Contract.


6. Limitation of Liability. The Contracting Party shall have no liability 
under this Consent to the Borrower. With respect to any undertaking by the 
Contracting Party which is susceptible to enforcement by specific 
enforcement as described in Section 7, where the Agent would receive the 
full benefit of this Consent through such specific performance, the Agent 
shall limit its remedy to specific performance. With respect to any other 
undertaking, acknowledgment, representation and warranty or other provision 
of this Consent, the Agents remedies shall not be so limited, provided 
that the Agent and the

not by way of limitation, loss of profits, nonpayment of principal or 
interest on loans, and cost of capital under the Credit Agreement).


7. Specific Performance. The Contracting Party acknowledges and agrees that 
the Borrower, the Agent, the Secured Parties and any Subsequent Transferee

breached. Accordingly, the Contracting Party agrees that the Borrower, the 
Agent and/or any Subsequent Transferee may seek to enforce specifically 
this Consent and the Applicable Provisions in any action instituted in any 
court of the United States or any state thereof having jurisdiction over 
the parties hereto and the matter hereof (subject to the provisions set 
forth in Section 9), in addition to any other remedy to which it may be

nonexclusive jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the 
Southern District of New York and of any New York State court sitting in 
New York City for purposes of all legal proceedings arising out of or 
relating to this Consent or the transactions contemplated hereby. Each of 
the parties hereto irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by 
law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the 
venue of any such proceeding brought in such a court and any claim that any 
such proceeding brought in such a court has been brought in an inconvenient 
forum.


10. Counterparts. This Consent and any amendments, waivers, consents or 
supplements hereto or in connection herewith may be executed in any number 
of counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate counterparts, 
each of which when so executed and delivered shall be deemed an original, 
but all such counterparts together shall constitute but one and the same 
instrument; signature pages may be detached from multiple separate 
counterparts and attached to a single counterpart so that all signature 
pages are physically attached to the same document.


11. Severability. In case any one or more of the provisions contained in 
this Consent should be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, 
the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall 
not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

[We/I] have acted as counsel for [                                ], a [    
                            ] (the Company), in connection with that 
certain [Contract and Consent] (collectively, the Contracts). Capitalized 
terms used and not otherwise defined herein shall have the respective 
meanings specified in the Consent.


This letter is being delivered to you in satisfaction of the condition set 
forth in Section 3 of the Consent.


In this connection, [we/I] have examined such certificates of public 
officials, certificates of officers of the Company and copies certified to 
[our/my] satisfaction of corporate documents and records of the Company and 
of other papers, and have made such other investigations, as [we/I] have 
deemed relevant and necessary as a basis for [our/my] opinions hereinafter 
set forth. [We/I] have relied upon such certificates of public officials 
and of officers of the Company with respect to the accuracy of material 
factual matters contained therein which were not independently established.


Based on the foregoing, it is [our/my] opinion that:


1. The Company is a corporation duly incorporated and validly existing in 
good standing under the laws of [                        ].

enforceable against the Company in accordance with their respective terms, 
except as such enforceability may be limited by (a) bankruptcy, insolvency, 
reorganization or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of 
creditors rights generally, and (b) general principles of equity 
(regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in 
equity or at law).


3. The execution and delivery of the Contracts, and fulfillment of and 
compliance with the respective provisions of the Contracts, do not conflict 
with, or result in a breach of the terms, conditions or provisions of, or 
constitute a default under, or result in any
