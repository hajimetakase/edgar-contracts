ARTICLE VI
COVENANTS OF THE PARTIES

Seller will be borne by and paid by Seller, except as provided in Section 
6.6 or unless the transactions contemplated hereby are not consummated 
through no fault of Seller (in which event, Buyer shall bear and pay such 
fees and expenses).


(b) Without limiting its covenants and agreements in Section 6.6, all 
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement by Buyer, the General

will be borne by and paid by Buyer, regardless of whether or not the 
transactions contemplated hereby are consummated.


Section 6.4. Public Announcements. Except as may be required by Applicable 
Law, neither Buyer, Affiliates of the General Partner or the Partnership, 
on the one hand, nor Seller, on the other, shall issue any press release or 
otherwise make any statement to the public generally with respect to this 
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior consent 
of the other parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld and 
which consent, if given verbally, shall be confirmed in writing within one 
Business Day thereafter). Buyer and Seller expressly agree that Buyer may 
make a press release or statement and file any required disclosures under

mandated by those laws. Buyer shall provide Seller with a draft copy of 
such press release or statement on Business Day before release or filing

Section 6.5. Tax Matters. The parties acknowledge that the sale of the 
Interest by Seller to Buyer will cause the Partnership to terminate for

Sellers approval in the manner provided in Section 6.10 of the Partnership 
Agreement and timely file with the IRS or any other appropriate taxing 
authorities all tax returns due for the Partnership (including the final 
federal income tax return on IRS Form 1065 for the Partnerships taxable 
period that ends at the Effective Date) in accordance with Section 6.10 of 
the Partnership Agreement. If Seller fails to approve any tax return 
referenced in the immediately preceding sentence, Seller and Buyer agree to 
use their Reasonable Commercial Efforts to resolve any disagreement or 
dispute between them in respect of such return as promptly as reasonably 
practicable. The parties further agree that no items of income, gain, loss, 
deduction or credit attributable to periods after the Closing Date shall be 
allocated to Seller and that Seller shall not be liable for any 
Partnership-level Taxes or other Taxes attributable to periods, operations, 
or oil and gas production after the Closing Date.

ARTICLE IX
SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS;
INDEMNIFICATION


Section 9.1. Survival.

(a) Each representation and warranty of the parties hereto contained in 
this Agreement shall survive the Closing until the first anniversary of the 
Closing Date (such anniversary being called the Survival Date). From and 
after a Survival Date, no party hereto shall be under any liability 
hereunder with respect to any representation or warranty, except with
 
-10-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
respect to matters as to which notice has been received in accordance with 
Section 9.1(b). All covenants of the parties hereto, to the extent not 
otherwise fully performed at Closing, will survive the Closing.


(b) No party hereto shall have any indemnification obligation pursuant to 
this Article IX or otherwise in respect of any representation, warranty or 
covenant under this Agreement unless it shall have received from the party 
seeking indemnification written notice of the existence of the claim for or 
in respect of which indemnification in respect of such representation, 
warranty or covenant is being sought. Such notice shall set forth with 
reasonable specificity (i) the basis under this Agreement, and the facts 
that otherwise form the basis of such claim, (ii) the estimate of the 
amount of such claim (which estimate shall not be conclusive of the final 
amount of such claim) and an explanation of the calculation of such 
estimate, including a statement of any significant assumptions employed 
therein, and (iii) the date on and manner in which the party delivering 
such notice became aware of the existence of such claim.


Section 9.2. Indemnification by Seller. Subject to the terms and conditions 
of this Article IX, Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Buyer 
from and against any and all claims, actions, causes of action, demands 
assessments, losses, damages, liabilities, judgments, settlements, 
penalties, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and 
expenses), of any nature whatsoever (collectively, Damages), asserted 
against, resulting to, imposed upon, or incurred by Buyer, directly or 
indirectly, by reason of or resulting from any breach by Seller of (i) 
Sellers representations and warranties contained in Article III or (ii) 
Sellers covenants contained in this Agreement.


Section 9.3. Indemnification by Buyer. Subject to the terms and conditions 
of this Article IX, Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller 
from and against any and all Damages, asserted against, resulting to, 
imposed upon, or incurred by Seller, directly or indirectly, by reason of 
or resulting from (i) any breach by Buyer of its representations, 
warranties and covenants contained in this Agreement, (ii) the Assumed 
Obligations or (iii) the Partnership and its ownership and operation of its 
properties and other assets.


Section 9.4. Indemnification Proceedings. In the event that any claim or 
demand for which a party (an Indemnifying Party), would be liable to the 
another party under Section 9.2 or Section 9.3 (an Indemnified Party) is 
asserted against or sought to be collected from an Indemnified Party by a 
third party, the Indemnified Party shall with reasonable promptness notify 
the Indemnifying Party of such claim or demand, but the failure so to 
notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of 
its obligations under this Article IX, except to the extent the 
Indemnifying Party demonstrates that the defense of such claim or demand is 
materially prejudiced thereby. The Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days 
from receipt of the above notice from the Indemnified Party (in this 
Section 9.4, the Notice Period) to notify the Indemnified Party whether 
or not the Indemnifying Party desires, at the Indemnifying Partys sole 
cost and expense, to defend the Indemnified Party against such claim or 
demand; provided, that the Indemnified Party is hereby authorized prior to 
and during the Notice Period to file any motion, answer or other pleading 
that it shall deem necessary or appropriate to protect its interests or 
those of the Indemnifying Party and not prejudicial to the Indemnifying 
Party. If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of any such 
claim or demand, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ 
separate counsel at its own expense and to participate in the defense 
thereof. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to assume the defense of such 
claim or demand (or fails to give notice to the Indemnified Party during 
the
 
-11-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Notice Period), the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to assume the 
defense of such claim or demand with counsel of its own choice, at the 
expense of the Indemnifying Party. If the claim or demand is asserted 
against both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party and based on 
the advice of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party it 
is determined that there is a conflict of interest which renders it 
inappropriate for the same counsel to represent both the Indemnifying Party 
and the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party shall be responsible for 
paying the reasonable expenses of separate counsel for the Indemnified 
Party; provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall not be 
responsible for paying for more than one separate firm of attorneys to 
represent all of the Indemnified Parties, regardless of the number of 
Indemnified Parties. If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense 
of such claim or demand, (i) no compromise or settlement thereof may be 
effected by the Indemnifying Party without the Indemnified Partys written 
consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld) unless the sole relief 
provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying 
Party and (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall have no liability with respect 
to any compromise or settlement thereof effected without its written 
consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld).


Section 9.5. Exclusivity. The parties hereto agree that after Closing, in 
relation to any breach, default, or nonperformance of any representation, 
warranty, covenant, or agreement made or entered into by a party hereto 
pursuant to this Agreement or any certificate, instrument, or document 
delivered pursuant hereto, the only relief and remedy available to the 
other party hereto in respect of said breach, default, or nonperformance 
shall be Damages, but only to the extent properly claimable hereunder and 
subject to the terms and provisions of this Article IX; provided, however, 
that the foregoing shall not be deemed to limit or modify the parties 
rights under Section 10.8.


Section 9.6. Indemnification Despite Negligence. It is the express 
intention of the parties hereto that each party to be indemnified pursuant 
to this Article IX shall be indemnified and held harmless from and against 
all Damages as to which indemnity is provided for under this Article IX, 
notwithstanding that any such Damages arise out of or result from the 
ordinary, strict, sole, or contributory negligence of such party and 
regardless of whether any other party (including the other parties to this 
Agreement) is or is not also negligent. The parties hereto acknowledge that 
the foregoing complies with the express negligence rule and is conspicuous.
