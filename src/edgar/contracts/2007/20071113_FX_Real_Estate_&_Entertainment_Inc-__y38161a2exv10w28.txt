Trustee nor any successor Trustee (collectively, the Exculpated Parties) 
shall be liable for the act, default or misconduct of any other party or 
for the Exculpated Partys own acts, defaults or misconduct except for such 
Exculpated Partys own gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Trustee 
may, in connection with the performance of its duties, and in its sole and 
absolute discretion, consult with the Professionals, and shall not be 
liable for anything done or omitted or suffered to be done in accordance 
with such advice or opinions. If the Trustee determines not to consult with 
any of the Professionals, such determination shall not be deemed to impose 
any liability on the Trustee.

     5.02 Indemnification.

          (a) The Trust shall indemnify and hold harmless the Trustee and 
its agents, employees, officers, directors, Professionals and principals in 
their capacity as such (collectively, the Indemnified Parties) from and 
against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses 
(including, without limitation, amounts paid in judgment, penalty or 
otherwise, fees and expenses of counsel and other professionals (other than 
any costs of internal personnel), with respect to claims on whatsoever 
theory (whether by way of third- or subsequent party complaint, 
cross-claim, separate action or otherwise) by any Person to recover in 
whole or in part any liability, direct or indirect, whether by way of 
judgment, penalty or otherwise, of any Person in connection with, arising 
out of or which is in any way related to the distribution of the FXREE 
Stock or the matters set forth in this Agreement except, with respect to 
any Indemnified Party, for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct 
(the foregoing losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses, 
collectively, Indemnification Costs).

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

          (b) Promptly after receipt by an Indemnified Party of notice of 
the commencement of any action referred to in Section 5.02(a) of this 
Agreement, such Indemnified Party shall give written notice to the Trustee 
thereof, but the omission so to notify the Trustee will not relieve the 
Trust from any liability that it may have to any Indemnified Party, except 
to the extent the Trust is actually prejudiced thereby. The Trust shall 
have no liability for any cost or expense incurred by such Indemnified 
Party prior to the notification to the Trustee of such action. In case any 
such action is brought against an Indemnified Party, and it notifies the 
Trustee of the commencement thereof, the Trustee on behalf of the Trust 
will be entitled to participate in, and to the extent that it may wish, to 
assume, the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the 
Indemnified Party, and after notice from the Trustee to such Indemnified 
Party, the Trust shall not, except as hereinafter provided, be responsible 
for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified 
Party in connection with the defense thereof. In the event the Trustee 
assumes the defense of the action, the Indemnified Party may retain 
separate counsel at its sole cost and expense (except that the Trustee 
shall be responsible for the fees and expenses of such separate co-counsel 
to the extent the Indemnified Party is advised, in writing by its counsel, 
that the counsel the Trustee has selected has a conflict of interest). Such 
assumption of the defense shall not prejudice the right of the Trust to 
claim at a later date that such third party action is not a proper matter 
for indemnification pursuant to this Section 5.02. The Trust shall not be 
liable for any settlement of any such action or proceeding effected without 
its written consent, but if settled with its written consent, or if there 
be a final judgment for the plaintiff in any such action or proceeding, the 
Trust agrees to indemnify and hold harmless such Indemnified Party from and 
against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.

          (c) To the extent the Trustee on behalf of the Trust has not 
assumed the defense of any action referred to in Section 5.02(a), the 
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to obtain advances (Indemnification 
Advances) from the Trust to cover their expenses of defending themselves 
in any action referred to in Section 5.02(a), provided, however, that the 
Indemnified Parties receiving such advances shall repay the amounts so 
advanced to the Trust within 5 days after the entry of a final order of any 
court of competent jurisdiction finding that such Indemnified Parties were 
not entitled to any indemnity under the provisions of this Section 5.02.

     5.03 Bond. The Trustee shall not be obligated to post a bond 
hereunder.

     5.04 Survival of Indemnities. The indemnities contained in this 
Section 8.01 shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

     5.05 Reliance; Agent; Advice of Counsel. The Trustee shall incur no 
liability in acting upon any signature, instrument, notice, resolution, 
request, consent, order, certificate, report, opinion, bond or other 
document or paper reasonably believed by it to be genuine and reasonably 
believed by it to be signed by the proper party or parties. Without 
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Trustee may rely, and shall 
be entitled to require as a condition of its distribution of the FXREE 
Stock as contemplated hereby, on an opinion of counsel to FXREE to the 
effect that a registration statement permitting the distribution of the 
FXREE Stock as contemplated hereby is effective, that the distribution may 
be made as contemplated hereby without violation

of the Securities Act of 1933 and that the necessary qualifications for 
state and other securities and blue sky laws have been received.

     5.06 Reliance on certificate of FXREE. As to any fact or matter the 
manner of ascertainment of which is not specifically described herein, the 
Trustee may, absent actual knowledge to the contrary, for all purposes 
hereof rely on a certificate, signed by any officer of FXREE, as to such 
fact or matter, and such certificate shall constitute full protection to 
the Trustee for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith 
in reliance thereon.

     5.07 Use of Agents by Trustee. In the administration of the trusts 
hereunder, the Trustee may execute any of the trusts or powers hereof and 
perform its powers and duties hereunder directly or through agents or 
attorneys and, at the expense of the Trust, consult with independent 
counsel, accountants and other skilled persons to be selected and employed 
by it, and the Trustee shall not be liable for anything done, suffered or 
omitted in good faith by it in accordance with the written advice or 
opinion of any such counsel, accountants or other skilled persons appointed 
by it with due care hereunder.

     9.04 Amendments and Waivers.

          (a) Except as provided below, the Trustee may not amend, modify 
and supplement this Agreement in any manner. The failure of any party 
hereto to enforce at any time any provision of this Agreement shall not be 
construed to be a waiver of such provision, nor in any way to affect the 
validity of this Agreement or any part hereof or the right of any party 
thereafter to enforce each and every such provision. No waiver of any 
breach of this Agreement shall be held to constitute a waiver of any other 
or subsequent breach.

          (b) If, at any time during the term of this Agreement, the Trust 
is, in the reasonable good faith judgment of the Trustee, reasonably likely 
to become subject to the reporting or registration requirements of the 
Exchange Act, the Trustee may amend this Agreement to the extent necessary 
to ensure that the Trust does not become subject to the reporting or 
registration requirements of the Exchange Act.

     9.05 Meanings of Other Terms. Except where the context otherwise 
requires, words importing the masculine gender include the feminine and the 
neuter, if appropriate, and words importing the singular number include the 
plural number and vice versa.

     9.06 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of 
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but such 
counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument.

     9.07 Parties in Interest. Except as expressly provided herein with 
respect to the Exculpated Parties and the Indemnified Parties, this 
Agreement shall not confer any rights or remedies upon any person or entity 
other than the parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and 
assigns.

     9.08 Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement 
among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof, 
supersedes and is in full substitution for any and all prior agreements and 
understandings among them relating to such subject matter, and no party 
shall be liable or bound to the other party hereto in any manner with 
respect to such subject matter by any warranties, representations, 
indemnities, covenants, or agreements except as specifically set forth 
herein. Any Exhibits or Schedules to this Agreement are hereby incorporated 
and made a part hereof and are an integral part of this Agreement.

     9.09 Construction. The language used in this Agreement will be deemed 
to be the language chosen by the parties to express their mutual intent, 
and no rule of strict construction will be applied against any party. Any 
references to any federal, state, local or foreign statute or law will also 
refer to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the 
context requires otherwise. Unless the context otherwise requires: (a) a 
term has the meaning assigned to it by this Agreement; (b) including means 
including but not limited to; (c) or is disjunctive but not exclusive; 
(d) words in the singular include the plural, and in the plural include the

     9.10 Interpretation by the Trustee. The Trustee may interpret and 
construe any of the provisions of this Agreement, insofar as the same may 
appear ambiguous or inconsistent with any other provisions hereof, and any 
such construction by the Trustee in good faith shall be binding upon the 
parties hereto and the CKX Stockholders.

     9.11 Severability. In the event that any one or more of the provisions 
contained in this Agreement or in any other instrument referred to herein, 
shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in 
any respect, then to the maximum extent permitted by law, such invalidity, 
illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision of this 
Agreement or any other such instrument. Furthermore, in lieu of any such 
invalid or unenforceable term or provision, the parties hereto intend that 
there shall be added as a part of this Agreement a provision as similar in 
terms to such invalid or unenforceable provision as may be possible and be 
valid and enforceable.
