CATAPULT COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION

EXECUTIVE OFFICER FY2008 VARIABLE COMPENSATION PLAN

1. 	  	Officer performance-based compensation for each quarter of fiscal 
year 2008 will be based exclusively on attainment by the Company of order 
bookings goals approved by the Board of Directors or Compensation Committee 
for those quarters.

2. 	  	Assigned target bonus amounts are established by the Compensation 
Committee in consultation with the Chief Executive Officer. Target bonuses 
will be paid in cash on a quarterly basis with respect to each quarter of 
fiscal year 2008 starting at achievement by the Company of 50% of the order 
bookings target and continuing on a linear basis to 100% achievement, at 
which level 100% of the target bonus will be paid. Should the Company 
exceed the order bookings target, executive officers will receive 
additional bonus compensation calculated by extending the line starting at 
50% at the same slope; e.g., the bonus will be double the target bonus for 
a particular quarter if orders (bookings) are 150% of the approved targets.

3. 	  	The compensation committee delegates to the CEO the power to award 
Company-wide bonuses to executive officers provided that the method used to 
determine these bonuses is comparable to that used to determine the bonuses 
for non- executive officers.

4. 	  	The participants in this plan shall be those persons designated from 
time to time by the board of directors as the executive officers of the 
Company.
