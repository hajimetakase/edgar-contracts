loss. The parties further agree to the terms and conditions set forth 
below:

1. iASPEC shall pay the True-up Amount due and payable under Section 4 of

2. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that, except as 
specifically set forth in this letter agreement, all of the terms and 
conditions of the MSA, including, but not limited to, all the obligations 
of the parties shall remain unchanged, with the same force and effect as if
