versa):

purpose of or resulting, directly or indirectly, in (a) the acquisition of 
all or substantially all of the assets of a Person, or of any business or

capital stock of a corporation (or similar entity), which stock has 
ordinary voting power for the election of the members of such entitys 
board of directors or persons exercising similar functions (other than 
stock having such power only by reason of the happening of a contingency), 
or the acquisition of in excess of 50% of the partnership interests or 
equity of any Person not a corporation which acquisition gives the

period whether or not it agrees to increase its Revolving Credit Commitment 
and, if so, whether by an amount equal to, greater than, or less than its 
Percentage Share of such requested increase. Any Lender not responding 
within such time period shall be deemed to have declined to increase its 
Revolving Credit Commitment.

(iii) The Administrative Agent shall notify Borrower of the Lenders 
responses to the request made hereunder. To achieve the full amount of a 
requested increase and subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent 
and the Issuing Bank (which approvals shall not be unreasonably withheld), 
Borrower may also invite additional Persons to become Lenders pursuant to a 
joinder agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative 
Agent and its counsel.

(iv) If the Aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments are increased in 
accordance with this Section, the Administrative Agent and Borrower shall 
determine the effective date (such date, the Increase Effective Date) and 
the final allocation of such increase. The Administrative Agent shall 
promptly (i) notify Borrower of the final allocation of such increase in 
the Revolving Credit Commitment and the Increase Effective Date, and (ii) 
notify each Lender of its Revolving Credit Commitment as of the Increase 
Effective Date.

(v) As a condition precedent to such increase, Borrower shall deliver to 
the Administrative Agent a certificate of each Obligor dated as of the 
Increase Effective Date signed by a Responsible Officer of such Obligor (i) 
certifying and attaching the resolutions adopted by such Obligor approving 
or consenting to such increase, and (ii) in the case of Borrower, 
certifying that, before and after giving effect to such increase, (A) the 
representations and warranties contained in Article VII and the other Loan 
Documents are true and correct on and as of the Increase Effective Date, 
except to the extent that such representations and warranties specifically 
refer to an earlier date, in which case they are true and correct as of 
such earlier date, and except that for purposes of this Section 2.03(a), 
the representations and warranties contained in Section 7.02 shall be 
deemed to refer to the most recent statements furnished pursuant to 
clauses (a) and (b), respectively, of Section 8.01, (B) no Default or Event 
of Default exists, and (C) no Material Adverse Effect shall have occurred. 
To the extent necessary to keep the outstanding Loans ratable with any 
revised Percentage Shares of the Lenders arising from any nonratable 
increase in the Revolving Credit Commitment under this Section, Borrower 
shall prepay Loans outstanding on the Increase Effective Date and/or 
Lenders shall make assignments pursuant to arrangements satisfactory to the 
Administrative Agent (provided, that in each case, Borrower shall pay any 
additional amounts required pursuant to Section 5.05).

(vi) This Section shall supersede any provisions in Sections 4.05 or 12.04 
to the contrary.

(b) Reduction in Revolving Credit Commitments. The Borrower shall have the 
right to terminate or to reduce the amount of the Aggregate Revolving 
Credit Commitments at any time, or from time to time, upon not less than 
three (3) Business Days prior notice to the Administrative Agent (which 
shall promptly notify the Lenders) of each such reduction, which notice 
shall specify the effective date thereof and the amount of any such 
termination or reduction (which shall not be less than $1,000,000 or any 
whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof; and no more than an amount 
by which the Aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments would be less than the 
aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Loans plus the LC Exposure, 
after giving effect to any concurrent prepayment pursuant to Section 4.01) 
and shall be irrevocable and
 
19

------------------------------------------------------------------------
effective only upon receipt by the Administrative Agent. The Aggregate 
Revolving Credit Commitments once terminated or reduced may not be 
reinstated.


Section 2.04 Fees.

(a) Commitment Fee. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for 
the account of each Lender a commitment fee on the daily average unused 
amount of the Borrowing Base for each Borrowing Base Period up to, but 
excluding, the earlier of the date the Aggregate Revolving Credit 
Commitments are terminated or the Revolving Credit Termination Date at a 
rate per annum equal to thirty-seven and one-half basis points (0.375%). 
Accrued commitment fees shall be payable quarterly in arrears on each 
Quarterly Date and on the earlier of the date the Aggregate Revolving 
Credit Commitments are terminated or the Revolving Credit Termination Date.

(b) Increase in Borrowing Base. The Borrower shall pay to the 
Administrative Agent, as a fee for the ratable account of the Lenders (i) a 
fee equal to one-quarter of one percent (0.25%) of the Initial Borrowing 
Base and (ii) a fee equal to one quarter of one percent (0.25%) of each 
marginal increase in the then current Borrowing Base. Any fee arising under 
this Section 2.04(b) is to be paid upon the Closing Date in the case of 
clause (i) and upon the effective date of the related Borrowing Base 
increase in the case of clause (ii).

(c) Letter of Credit Fees.

(i) The Borrower agrees to pay the Administrative Agent, for the account of 
each Lender, commissions for issuing the Letters of Credit on the daily 
average outstanding of the maximum liability of the Issuing Bank existing 
from time to time under such Letter of Credit (calculated separately for 
each Letter of Credit) at the rate per annum equal to the Applicable Margin 
in effect from time to time for LIBOR Loans. Each Letter of Credit shall be 
deemed to be outstanding up to the full face amount of the Letter of Credit 
until the Issuing Bank has received the canceled Letter of Credit or a 
written cancellation of the Letter of Credit from the beneficiary of such 
Letter of Credit in form and substance acceptable to the Issuing Bank, or 
for any reductions in the amount of the Letter of Credit (other than from a 
drawing), written notification from the beneficiary of such Letter of 
Credit. Such commissions are payable in advance at issuance of the Letter 
of Credit for the first year thereof and thereafter, quarterly in arrears 
on each Quarterly Date and upon cancellation or expiration of each such 
Letter of Credit.

(ii) The Borrower agrees to pay the Administrative Agent, for the account 
of the Issuing Bank, commissions for issuing the Letters of Credit 
(calculated separately for each Letter of Credit) equal to 0.25% of the 
face amount of each Letter of Credit, payable upon issuance of such Letter 
of Credit.

(d) Engineering Fee. The Borrower shall pay to Administrative Agent for its 
account an engineering fee on the commencement of each Borrowing Base 
Period in the amount of $15,000.00 in connection with each Scheduled 
Borrowing Base review commencing on the Closing Date, and in connection 
with each Special Borrowing Base Determination requested by the Borrower, 
which shall be due on the date of the Borrowers request for the Special 
Borrowing Base Determination.


Section 2.05 Several Obligations.
 
20

------------------------------------------------------------------------
The failure of any Lender to make any Loan to be made by it or to provide 
funds for disbursements or reimbursements under Letters of Credit on the 
date specified therefor shall not relieve any other Lender of its 
obligation to make its Loan or provide funds on such date, but no Lender 
shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make a Loan to 
be made by such other Lender or to provide funds to be provided by such 
other Lender.


Section 2.06 Notes.

The Loans made by each Lender shall be evidenced by a single promissory 
note of the Borrower in substantially the form of Exhibit A dated (i) the 
Closing Date or (ii) the effective date of an assignment pursuant to 
Section 12.05(b), payable to the order of such Lender in a principal amount 
equal to its Maximum Revolving Credit Amount as originally in effect and 
otherwise duly completed and such substitute Notes as required by Section 
12.05(b). The date, amount, Type, interest rate and Interest Period of each 
Loan made by each Lender, and all payments made on account of the principal 
thereof, shall be recorded by such Lender on its books for its Note, and, 
prior to any transfer may be endorsed by such Lender on the schedule 
attached to such Note or any continuation thereof or on any separate record 
maintained by such Lender. Failure to make any such notation or to attach a 
schedule shall not affect any Lenders or the Borrowers rights or 
obligations in respect of such Loans or affect the validity of such 
transfer by any Lender of its Note.


Section 2.07 Prepayments.

(a) Voluntary Prepayments. The Borrower may prepay the Base Rate Loans upon 
not less than one (1) Business Days prior notice to the Administrative 
Agent (which shall promptly notify the Lenders), which notice shall specify 
the prepayment date (which shall be a Business Day) and the amount of the 
prepayment (which shall be at least $100,000 or the remaining aggregate 
principal balance outstanding on the Notes) and shall be irrevocable and 
effective only upon receipt by the Administrative Agent, provided that 
interest on the principal prepaid, accrued to the prepayment date, shall be 
paid on the prepayment date. The Borrower may prepay LIBOR Loans on the 
same conditions as for Base Rate Loans (except that prior notice to the 
Administrative Agent shall be not less than three (3) Business Days for 
LIBOR Loans) and in addition such prepayments of LIBOR Loans shall be 
subject to the terms of Section 5.05 and shall be in an amount equal to all 
of the LIBOR Loans for the Interest Period prepaid. In the event of a 
voluntary prepayment pursuant to this Section 2.07(a), Borrower shall be 
entitled to reborrow such amounts pursuant to Section 2.01.

(b) Mandatory Prepayments.

(i) Borrowing Base. If a Borrowing Base Deficiency results from the 
redetermination of the Borrowing Base or a reduction in the Borrowing Base 
pursuant to Section 2.08(b), then the Borrower shall, within thirty (30) 
days, (i) prepay the Loans in an aggregate principal amount sufficient to 
eliminate such Borrowing Base Deficiency, together with interest on the 
principal amount paid accrued to the date of each such prepayment, (ii) 
pledge, or cause any Subsidiary to pledge, additional unencumbered 
collateral of sufficient value and character (as determined by the 
Administrative Agent and the Lenders in their sole discretion) that when 
added to the existing collateral shall cause the Borrowing Base to equal or 
exceed the aggregate outstanding Loans plus the LC Exposure, or (iii) any 
combination of (i) and (ii) satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and 
the Lenders. If, because of LC Exposure, a Borrowing Base Deficiency 
remains after prepaying all of the Loans, the Borrower shall pay to the 
Administrative
 
21

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Agent on behalf of the Lenders an amount equal to such remaining Borrowing 
Base Deficiency to be held as cash collateral as provided in Section 
2.10(b).

(ii) Upon Procurement of Capital. If, at any time after the Closing Date, 
the Borrower obtains funds by the sale of capital stock or any other equity 
offering or by the issuance of subordinated unsecured Debt to the extent 
permitted by the terms of this Agreement, and if at such time there exists 
a Borrowing Base Deficiency, the proceeds obtained by such capital stock or 
other equity offering or issuance of such Debt shall first be used to pay 
such Borrowing Base Deficiency.

(c) Generally. Prepayments permitted or required under this Section 2.07 
shall be without premium or penalty, except as required under Section 5.05 
for prepayment of LIBOR Loans. Any prepayments on the Loans may be 
reborrowed subject to the then effective Aggregate Revolving Credit 
Commitments.


Section 2.08 Borrowing Base.

(a) The Borrowing Base shall be determined in accordance with Section 
2.08(b) by the Administrative Agent with the concurrence of the Lenders and 
is subject to redetermination in accordance with Section 2.08(c). Upon any 
redetermination of the Borrowing Base, such redetermination shall remain in 
effect until the next successive Redetermination Date. So long as any of 
the Commitments are in effect or any LC Exposure or Loans are outstanding 
hereunder, this facility shall be governed by the then effective Borrowing 
Base. During the period from and after the Closing Date until the first 
redetermination pursuant to Section 2.08 or adjusted pursuant to Section 
8.07(b), the amount of the Borrowing Base shall be $35,000,000 (the 
Initial Borrowing Base).

(b) Upon receipt of the reports required by Section 8.07 and such other 
reports, data and supplemental information as may from time to time be 
reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent (the Engineering Reports
), the Borrowing Base shall be redetermined for each Borrowing Base Period 
and each such redetermination shall be effective as of the date set forth 
in such notice of redetermination (the Scheduled Redetermination Date). 
The Borrowing Base shall be determined based upon the loan collateral value 
assigned to the Mortgaged Properties and such other credit factors 
(including without limitation the assets, liabilities, cash flow, business, 
properties, prospects, management and ownership of the Borrower) which the 
Lenders deem significant. The Lenders determination of the Borrowing Base 
shall be in their sole discretion and shall not be subject to review or 
challenge. Upon each redetermination of the Borrowing Base, the 
Administrative Agent shall recommend to the Lenders a new Borrowing Base 
and the Lenders in accordance with their customary policies and procedures 
for extending credit to oil and gas reserve-based customers shall (by 
unanimous agreement) establish the redetermined Borrowing Base; provided, 
however, that any decrease in the Borrowing Base or reaffirmation of the 
existing Borrowing Base shall require Majority Lender approval. If the 
Borrower does not furnish the Engineering Reports by the date required, the 
Lenders may nonetheless determine a new Borrowing Base. It is expressly 
understood that the Lenders shall have no obligation to determine the 
Borrowing Base at any particular amount, either in relation to the Maximum 
Revolving Credit Amount or otherwise.

(c) In addition to Scheduled Borrowing Base Determinations pursuant to 
Section 2.08(b), the Borrower and the Lenders may each request one (1) 
additional redetermination of the Borrowing Base during each Borrowing Base 
Period. In the event the Borrower requests a Special Borrowing Base 
Determination pursuant to this Section 2.08(c),
 
22

------------------------------------------------------------------------
the Borrower shall deliver written notice of such request to the 
Administrative Agent which shall include: (i) Engineering Report(s) 
prepared as of a date not more than thirty (30) calendar days prior to the 
date of such request, and (ii) such other information as Administrative 
Agent and the Lenders shall request prepared as of a date not more than 
thirty (30) calendar days prior to the date of such request. Likewise, in 
the event the Lenders exercise their option for a Special Borrowing Base 
Determination, the Administrative Agent shall give the Borrower notice of 
the redetermined Borrowing Base.


Section 2.09 Assumption of Risks.

The Borrower assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary 
of any Letter of Credit or any transferee thereof with respect to its use 
of such Letter of Credit. Neither the Issuing Bank (except in the case of 
gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Issuing Bank or 
any of its employees), its correspondents nor any Lender shall be 
responsible for the validity, sufficiency or genuineness of certificates or 
other documents or any endorsements thereon, even if such certificates or 
other documents should in fact prove to be invalid, insufficient, 
fraudulent or forged; for errors, omissions, interruptions or delays in 
transmissions or delivery of any messages by mail, telex, or otherwise, 
whether or not they be in code; for errors in translation or for errors in 
interpretation of technical terms; the validity or sufficiency of any 
instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign 
any Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds 
thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective 
for any reason; the failure of any beneficiary or any transferee of any 
Letter of Credit to comply fully with conditions required in order to draw 
upon any Letter of Credit; or for any other consequences arising from 
causes beyond the Issuing Banks control or the control of the Issuing 
Banks correspondents. In addition, neither the Issuing Bank, the 
Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall be responsible for any error, 
neglect, or default of any of the Issuing Banks correspondents; and none 
of the above shall affect, impair or prevent the vesting of any of the 
Issuing Banks, the Administrative Agents or any Lenders rights or powers 
hereunder or under the Letter of Credit Agreements, all of which rights 
shall be cumulative. The Issuing Bank and its correspondents may accept 
certificates or other documents that appear on their face to be in order, 
without responsibility for further investigation of any matter contained 
therein regardless of any notice or information to the contrary. In 
furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing provisions, the Borrower 
agrees that any action, inaction or omission taken or not taken by the 
Issuing Bank or by any correspondent for the Issuing Bank in good faith in 
connection with any Letter of Credit, or any related drafts, certificates, 
documents or instruments, shall be binding on the Borrower and shall not 
put the Issuing Bank or its correspondents under any resulting liability to 
the Borrower.


Section 2.10 Obligation to Reimburse and to Prepay.

(a) If a disbursement by the Issuing Bank is made under any Letter of 
Credit, the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent within two (2) 
Business Days after notice of any such disbursement is received by the 
Borrower, the amount of each such disbursement made by the Issuing Bank 
under the Letter of Credit (if such payment is not sooner effected as may 
be required under this Section 2.10 or under other provisions of the Letter 
of Credit), together with interest on the amount disbursed from and 
including the date of disbursement until payment in full of such disbursed 
amount at a varying rate per annum equal to (i) the then applicable 
interest rate for Base Rate Loans through the second Business Day after 
notice of such disbursement is received by the Borrower and (ii) 
thereafter, the Post-Default Rate for Base Rate Loans (but in no event to 
exceed the Highest Lawful Rate) for the period from and including the third 
Business Day following the date of such disbursement to and including the 
date of repayment in full of such disbursed amount. The obligations of the 
Borrower under this Agreement with respect to each Letter of Credit shall 
be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable and shall be paid or
 
23

------------------------------------------------------------------------
performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under all 
circumstances whatsoever, including, without limitation, but only to the 
fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the following circumstances: 
(i) any lack of validity or enforceability of this Agreement, any Letter of 
Credit or any of the Security Instruments; (ii) any amendment or waiver of 
(including any default), or any consent to departure from this Agreement 
(except to the extent permitted by any amendment or waiver), any Letter of 
Credit or any of the Security Instruments; (iii) the existence of any 
claim, set-off, defense or other rights which the Borrower may have at any 
time against the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit or any transferee of 
any Letter of Credit (or any Persons for whom any such beneficiary or any 
such transferee may be acting), the Issuing Bank, the Administrative Agent, 
any Lender or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, 
any Letter of Credit, the Security Instruments, the transactions 
contemplated hereby or any unrelated transaction; (iv) any statement, 
certificate, draft, notice or any other document presented under any Letter 
of Credit proves to have been forged, fraudulent, insufficient or invalid 
in any respect or any statement therein proves to have been untrue or 
inaccurate in any respect whatsoever; (v) payment by the Issuing Bank under 
any Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft certificate which 
appears on its face to comply, but does not comply, with the terms of such 
Letter of Credit; and (vi) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, 
whether or not similar to any of the foregoing.

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Borrower 
will not be liable for payment or performance that results from the gross 
negligence or willful misconduct of the Issuing Bank, except (i) where the 
Borrower or any Subsidiary actually recovers the proceeds for itself or the 
Issuing Bank of any payment made by the Issuing Bank in connection with 
such gross negligence or willful misconduct or (ii) in cases where the 
Administrative Agent makes payment to the named beneficiary of a Letter of 
Credit.

(b) In the event of the occurrence of any Event of Default, a payment or 
prepayment pursuant to Section 2.07(b) or the maturity of the Notes, 
whether by acceleration or otherwise, an amount equal to the LC Exposure 
(or the excess in the case of Section 2.07(b)) shall be deemed to be 
forthwith due and owing by the Borrower to the Issuing Bank, the 
Administrative Agent and the Lenders as of the date of any such occurrence; 
and the Borrowers obligation to pay such amount shall be absolute and 
unconditional, without regard to whether any beneficiary of any such Letter 
of Credit has attempted to draw down all or a portion of such amount under 
the terms of a Letter of Credit, and, to the fullest extent permitted by 
applicable law, shall not be subject to any defense or be affected by a 
right of set-off, counterclaim or recoupment which the Borrower may now or 
hereafter have against any such beneficiary, the Issuing Bank, the 
Administrative Agent, the Lenders or any other Person for any reason 
whatsoever. Such payments shall be held by the Issuing Bank on behalf of 
the Lenders as cash collateral securing the LC Exposure in an account or 
accounts at the Principal Office; and the Borrower hereby grants to and by 
its deposit with the Administrative Agent grants to the Administrative 
Agent a security interest in such cash collateral. In the event of any such 
payment by the Borrower of amounts contingently owing under outstanding 
Letters of Credit and in the event that thereafter drafts or other demands 
for payment complying with the terms of such Letters of Credit are not made 
prior to the respective expiration dates thereof, the Administrative Agent 
agrees, if no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or if no 
other amounts are outstanding under this Agreement, the Notes or the 
Security Instruments, to remit to the Borrower amounts for which the 
contingent obligations evidenced by the Letters of Credit have ceased.

(c) Each Lender severally and unconditionally agrees that it shall promptly 
reimburse the Issuing Bank an amount equal to such Lenders Percentage 
Share of any
 
24

------------------------------------------------------------------------
disbursement made by the Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit that is 
not reimbursed according to this Section 2.10.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if no 
Default exists and subject to availability under the Aggregate Revolving 
Credit Commitments (after reduction for LC Exposure), to the extent the 
Borrower has not reimbursed the Issuing Bank for any drawn upon Letter of 
Credit within one (1) Business Day after notice of such disbursement has 
been received by the Borrower, the amount of such Letter of Credit 
reimbursement obligation shall automatically be funded by the Lenders as a 
Loan hereunder and used by the Lenders to pay such Letter of Credit 
reimbursement obligation. If an Event of Default has occurred and is 
continuing, or if the funding of such Letter of Credit reimbursement 
obligation as a Loan would cause the aggregate amount of all Loans 
outstanding to exceed the Aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments (after 
reduction for LC Exposure), such Letter of Credit reimbursement obligation 
shall not be funded as a Loan, but instead shall accrue interest as 
provided in Section 2.10(a).


Section 2.11 Lending Offices.

The Loans of each Type made by each Lender shall be made and maintained at 
such Lenders Applicable Lending Office for Loans of such Type.



ARTICLE III


Payments of Principal and Interest


Section 3.01 Repayment of Loans.

(a) Loans. On the Revolving Credit Termination Date the Borrower shall 
repay the outstanding aggregate principal of the Notes.

(b) Generally. The Borrower will pay to the Administrative Agent, for the 
account of each Lender, the principal payments required by this Section 
3.01.


Section 3.02 Interest.

(a) Interest Rates. The Borrower will pay to the Administrative Agent, for 
the account of each Lender, interest on the unpaid principal amount of each 
Loan made by such Lender for the period commencing on the date such Loan is 
made to, but excluding, the date such Loan shall be paid in full, at the 
following rates per annum:

(A) if such a Loan is a Base Rate Loan, the Base Rate (as in effect from 
time to time) plus the Applicable Margin, but in no event to exceed the 
Highest Lawful Rate; and

(B) if such a Loan is a LIBOR Loan, for each Interest Period relating 
thereto, the LIBOR Rate for such Loan plus the Applicable Margin (as in 
effect from time to time), but in no event to exceed the Highest Lawful 
Rate.

(b) Post-Default Rate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrower will pay 
to the Administrative Agent, for the account of each Lender interest at the 
applicable Post-Default Rate on any of any Loan made by such Lender, and 
(to the fullest extent permitted by law) on any other amount payable by the 
Borrower hereunder, under any Loan Document or under any Note
 
25

------------------------------------------------------------------------
held by such Lender to or for account of such Lender, for the period 
commencing on the date of an Event of Default until the same is paid in 
full or all Events of Default are cured or waived.

(c) Due Dates. Accrued interest on Base Rate Loans shall be payable on each 
Quarterly Date commencing on October 1, 2007, and accrued interest on each 
LIBOR Loan shall be payable on the last day of the Interest Period therefor 
and, if such Interest Period is longer than three months at three-month 
intervals following the first day of such Interest Period, except that 
interest payable at the Post-Default Rate shall be payable from time to 
time on demand and interest on any LIBOR Loan that is converted into a Base 
Rate Loan (pursuant to Section 5.04) shall be payable on the date of 
conversion (but only to the extent so converted). Any accrued and unpaid 
interest on the Loans on the Revolving Credit Termination Date shall be 
paid on such date.

(d) Determination of Rates. Promptly after the determination of any 
interest rate provided for herein or any change therein, the Administrative 
Agent shall notify the Lenders to which such interest is payable and the 
Borrower thereof. Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an 
interest rate or fee hereunder shall, except in cases of manifest error, be 
final, conclusive and binding on the parties.



ARTICLE IV


Payments; Pro Rata Treatment; Computations; Etc.


Section 4.01 Payments Generally; Administrative Agents Clawback.

(a) General. Except to the extent otherwise provided herein, all payments 
of principal, interest and other amounts to be made by the Borrower under 
this Agreement, the Notes, Letters of Credit, and the Letter of Credit 
Agreements shall be made in Dollars, in immediately available funds, to the 
Administrative Agent at such account as the Administrative Agent shall 
specify by notice to the Borrower from time to time, not later than 11:00 
a.m. Houston, Texas time on the date on which such payments shall become 
due (each such payment made after such time on such due date to be deemed 
to have been made on the next succeeding Business Day). Such payments shall 
be made without (to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law) 
defense, set-off or counterclaim. Each payment received by the 
Administrative Agent under this Agreement or any Note for account of a 
Lender shall be paid promptly to such Lender in immediately available 
funds. Except as otherwise provided in the definition of Interest Period
, if the due date of any payment under this Agreement or any Note would 
otherwise fall on a day which is not a Business Day such date shall be 
extended to the next succeeding Business Day and interest shall be payable 
for any principal so extended for the period of such extension. At the time 
of each payment to the Administrative Agent of any principal of or interest 
on any borrowing, the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of the 
Loans to which such payment shall apply. In the absence of such notice the 
Administrative Agent may specify the Loans to which such payment shall 
apply, but to the extent possible such payment or prepayment will be 
applied first to the Loans comprised of Base Rate Loans.

(b) Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent. Unless the 
Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the 
proposed date of any borrowing that such Lender will not make available to 
the Administrative Agent such Lenders share of such borrowing, the 
Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share 
available on such date in accordance with Section 2.02 (or, in the case of 
a borrowing of Base Rate Loans, that such Lender has made such share 
available in accordance with and at the
 
26

------------------------------------------------------------------------
time required by Section 2.02) and may, in reliance upon such assumption, 
make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a 
Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable borrowing available 
to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower 
severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such 
corresponding amount in immediately available funds with interest thereon, 
for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to 
the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative 
Agent, at (i) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the 
greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the 
Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank 
compensation, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees 
customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the 
foregoing, and (ii) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, 
the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans. If the Borrower and such 
Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or 
an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the 
Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period. 
If such Lender pays its share of the applicable borrowing to the 
Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such 
Lenders Loan included in such borrowing. Any payment by the Borrower shall 
be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender 
that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.

(c) Payments by Borrower; Presumptions by Administrative Agent. Unless the 
Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to 
the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the 
account of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank hereunder that the Borrower will 
not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the 
Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, 
in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the Issuing 
Bank, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower 
has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the Issuing 
Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative 
Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or the 
Issuing Bank, in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for 
each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to 
but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the 
greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the 
Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank 
compensation.


Section 4.02 Pro Rata Treatment.

Except to the extent otherwise provided herein each Lender agrees that: (i) 
each borrowing from the Lenders under Section 2.01 and each continuation 
and conversion under Section 2.02 shall be made from the Lenders pro rata 
in accordance with their Percentage Share, each payment of fees under 
Sections 2.04(a), 2.04(b), and 2.04(c)(i) shall be made for account of the 
Lenders pro rata in accordance with their Percentage Share, and each 
termination or reduction of the amount of the Aggregate Maximum Revolving 
Credit Amounts under Section 2.03(b) shall be applied to the Commitment of 
each Lender, pro rata according to the amounts of its respective 
Commitment; (ii) each payment of principal of Loans by the Borrower shall 
be made for account of the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the 
respective unpaid principal amount of the Loans held by the Lenders; and 
(iii) each payment of interest on Loans by the Borrower shall be made for 
account of the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the amounts of interest 
due and payable to the respective Lenders; and (iv) each reimbursement by 
the Borrower of disbursements under Letters of Credit shall be made for 
account of the Issuing Bank or, if funded by the Lenders, pro rata for the 
account of the Lenders, in accordance with the amounts of reimbursement 
obligations due and payable to each respective Lender.


Section 4.03 Computations.
 
27

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Interest on LIBOR Loans and fees shall be computed on the basis of a year 
of 360 days and actual days elapsed (including the first day but excluding 
the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest is payable, 
unless such calculation would exceed the Highest Lawful Rate, in which case 
interest shall be calculated on the per annum basis of a year of 365 or 366 
days, as the case may be. Interest on Base Rate Loans shall be computed on 
the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days 
elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in 
the period for which such interest is payable.


Section 4.04 Non-receipt of Funds by the Administrative Agent.

Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified by a Lender or the 
Borrower prior to the date on which such notifying party is scheduled to 
make payment to the Administrative Agent (in the case of a Lender) of the 
proceeds of a Loan or a payment under a Letter of Credit to be made by it 
hereunder or (in the case of the Borrower) a payment to the Administrative 
Agent for account of one or more of the Lenders hereunder (such payment 
being herein called the Required Payment), which notice shall be 
effective upon receipt, that it does not intend to make the Required 
Payment to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume 
that the Required Payment has been made and may, in reliance upon such 
assumption (but shall not be required to), make the amount thereof 
available to the intended recipient(s) on such date and, if such Lender or 
the Borrower (as the case may be) has not in fact made the Required Payment 
to the Administrative Agent, the recipient(s) of such payment shall, on 
demand, repay to the Administrative Agent the amount so made available 
together with interest thereon in respect of each day during the period 
commencing on the date such amount was so made available by the 
Administrative Agent until, but excluding, the date the Administrative 
Agent recovers such amount at a rate per annum which, for any Lender as 
recipient, will be equal to the Federal Funds Rate, and for the Borrower as 
recipient, will be equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin.


Section 4.05 Set-off, Sharing of Payments, Etc.

(a) If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each 
Lender, the Issuing Bank and each of their respective Affiliates is hereby 
authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent 
permitted by applicable law, to set off and apply any and all deposits 
(general or special, time or demand, provisional or final, in whatever 
currency) at any time held and other obligations (in whatever currency) at 
any time owing by such Lender, the Issuing Bank or any such Affiliate to or 
for the credit or the account of the Borrower or any other Obligor against 
any and all of the obligations of the Borrower or any other Obligor now or 
hereafter existing under this Agreement or any other Loan Document to such 
Lender or the Issuing Bank, irrespective of whether or not such Lender or 
the Issuing Bank shall have made any demand under this Agreement or any 
other Loan Document and although such obligations of the Borrower or any 
other Obligor may be contingent or unmatured or are owed to a branch or 
office of such Lender or the Issuing Bank different from the branch or 
office holding such deposit or obligated on such indebtedness. The rights 
of each Lender, the Issuing Bank and their respective Affiliates under this 
Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other 
rights of setoff) that such Lender, the Issuing Bank or their respective 
Affiliates may have. Each Lender and the Issuing Bank agrees to notify the 
Borrower and the Administrative Agent promptly after any such setoff and 
application, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect 
the validity of such setoff and application.

(b) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim 
or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on 
any of the Loans made by it, or the participations in L/C Exposure 
resulting in such Lenders receiving payment of a proportion of the 
aggregate amount of such Loans or participations and accrued interest 
thereon
 
28

------------------------------------------------------------------------
greater than its pro rata share thereof as provided herein, then the Lender 
receiving such greater proportion shall (i) notify the Administrative Agent 
of such fact, and (ii) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in 
the Loans and subparticipations in L/C Exposure, or make such other 
adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments 
shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate 
amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans and 
other amounts owing them, provided that:

(i) if any such participations or subparticipations are purchased and all 
or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such 
participations or subparticipations shall be rescinded and the purchase 
price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and

(ii) the provisions of this Section shall not be construed to apply to (y) 
any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the 
express terms of this Agreement or (z) any payment obtained by a Lender as 
consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of 
its Loans or subparticipations in L/C Exposure, other than to the Borrower 
or any Subsidiary thereof (as to which the provisions of this Section shall 
apply).


Each Obligor consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may 
effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a 
participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against 
such Obligor rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such 
participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such 
Obligor in the amount of such participation.


Section 4.06 Taxes.

(a) Payments Free of Taxes. Any and all payments by or on account of any 
obligation of the Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall 
be made free and clear of and without reduction or withholding for any 
Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, provided that if the Borrower shall be 
required by applicable law to deduct any Indemnified Taxes (including any 
Other Taxes) from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be 
increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions 
(including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this 
Section) the Administrative Agent, Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may 
be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such 
deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions and 
(iii) the Borrower shall timely pay the full amount deducted to the 
relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

(b) Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower. Without limiting the provisions 
of subsection (a) above, the Borrower shall timely pay any Other Taxes to 
the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

(c) Indemnification by the Borrower. The Borrower shall indemnify the 
Administrative Agent, each Lender and the Issuing Bank, within ten (10) 
days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or 
Other Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted 
on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) paid by the 
Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, 
and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or 
with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes 
were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental 
Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability 
delivered to the Borrower by a Lender or the Issuing Bank (with a copy to 
the
 
29

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or 
on behalf of a Lender or the Issuing Bank, shall be conclusive absent 
manifest error.

(d) Evidence of Payments. As soon as practicable after any payment of 
Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental 
Authority, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the 
original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental 
Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such 
payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the 
Administrative Agent.

(e) Status of Lenders. Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption 
from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in 
which the Borrower is resident for tax purposes, or any treaty to which 
such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments hereunder or under 
any other Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the 
Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law or 
reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such 
properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law 
as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced 
rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if requested by the Borrower 
or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation 
prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the 
Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative 
Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup 
withholding or information reporting requirements.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that the 
Borrower is resident for tax purposes in the United States, any Foreign 
Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such 
number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the 
date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement 
(and from time to time thereafter upon the request of the Borrower or the 
Administrative Agent, but only if such Foreign Lender is legally entitled 
to do so), whichever of the following is applicable:

(i) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN claiming 
eligibility for benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States 
is a party,

(ii) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI,

(iii) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the 
exemption for portfolio interest under section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a 
certificate to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not (A) a bank 
within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (B) a 10 percent 
shareholder of the Borrower within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(B) of 
the Code, or (C) a controlled foreign corporation described in section 
881(c)(3)(C) of the Code and (y) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue 
Service Form W-8BEN, or

(iv) any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming 
exemption from or a reduction in United States Federal withholding tax duly 
completed together with such supplementary documentation as may be 
prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower to determine the 
withholding or deduction required to be made.

(f) Treatment of Certain Refunds. If the Administrative Agent, any Lender 
or the Issuing Bank determines, in its sole discretion, that it has 
received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been 
indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower
 
30

------------------------------------------------------------------------
has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section, it shall pay to the 
Borrower an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of 
indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under 
this Section with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such 
refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent, 
such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, and without interest 
(other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with 
respect to such refund), provided that the Borrower, upon the request of 
the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Bank, agrees to repay 
the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other 
charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the 
Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Bank in the event the 
Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Bank is required to repay 
such refund to such Governmental Authority. This subsection shall not be 
construed to require the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Issuing 
Bank to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating 
to its taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other 
Person.



ARTICLE V


Capital Adequacy


Section 5.01 Increased Costs.

(a) Increased Costs Generally. If any Change in Law shall:

(i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, 
compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, 
deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in 
by, any Lender (except any Reserve Requirement reflected in the LIBOR Rate, 
or the Issuing Bank;

(ii) subject any Lender or the Issuing Bank to any tax of any kind 
whatsoever with respect to this Agreement, any Letter of Credit, any 
participation in a Letter of Credit or any LIBOR Loans made by it, or 
change the basis of taxation of payments to such Lender or the Issuing Bank 
in respect thereof (except for Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes covered by 
Section 3.01 and the imposition of, or any change in the rate of, any 
Excluded Tax payable by such Lender or the Issuing Bank); or

(iii) impose on any Lender or the Issuing Bank or the London interbank 
market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or 
LIBOR Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation 
therein;

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to 
such Lender of making or maintaining any LIBOR Loan (or of maintaining its 
obligation to make any such Loan), or to increase the cost to such Lender 
or the Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter 
of Credit (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue 
any Letter of Credit), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or 
receivable by such Lender or the Issuing Bank hereunder (whether of 
principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender 
or the Issuing Bank, the Borrower will pay to such Lender or the Issuing 
Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will 
compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, for such 
additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.

(b) Capital Requirements. If any Lender or the Issuing Bank determines that 
any Change in Law affecting such Lender or the Issuing Bank or any Lending 
Office of such Lender
 
31

------------------------------------------------------------------------
or such Lenders or the Issuing Banks holding company, if any, regarding 
capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of 
return on such Lenders or the Issuing Banks capital or on the capital of 
such Lenders or the Issuing Banks holding company, if any, as a 
consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans 
made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or 
the Letters of Credit issued by the Issuing Bank, to a level below that 
which such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such Lenders or the Issuing 
Banks holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law 
(taking into consideration such Lenders or the Issuing Banks policies and 
the policies of such Lenders or the Issuing Banks holding company with 
respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay 
to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional 
amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank or 
such Lenders or the Issuing Banks holding company for any such reduction 
suffered.

(c) Certificates for Reimbursement. A certificate of a Lender or the 
Issuing Bank setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate 
such Lender or the Issuing Bank or its holding company, as the case may be, 
as specified in subsection (a) or (b) of this Section and delivered to the 
Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay 
such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount shown as 
due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.

(d) Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the 
Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of 
this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lenders or the Issuing 
Banks right to demand such compensation, provided that the Borrower shall 
not be required to compensate a Lender or the Issuing Bank pursuant to the 
foregoing provisions of this Section for any increased costs incurred or 
reductions suffered more than nine months prior to the date that such 
Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of 
the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of 
such Lenders or the Issuing Banks intention to claim compensation 
therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased 
costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine-month period referred to 
above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect 
thereof).


Section 5.02 Limitation on LIBOR Loans.

Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, if, on or prior to the 
determination of any LIBOR Rate for any Interest Period:

(i) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be 
conclusive, absent manifest error) that quotations of interest rates for 
the relevant deposits referred to in the definition of LIBOR Rate in 
Section 1.02 are not being provided in the relevant amounts or for the 
relevant maturities for purposes of determining rates of interest for LIBOR 
Loans as provided herein; or

(ii) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be 
conclusive, absent manifest error) that the relevant rates of interest 
referred to in the definition of LIBOR Rate in Section 1.02 upon the 
basis of which the rate of interest for LIBOR Loans for such Interest 
Period is to be determined are not sufficient to adequately cover the cost 
to the Lenders of making or maintaining LIBOR Loans; then the 
Administrative Agent shall give the Borrower prompt notice thereof, and so 
long as such condition remains in effect, the Lenders shall be under no 
obligation to make additional LIBOR Loans.
 
32

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Section 5.03 Illegality.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in the event that it 
becomes unlawful for any Lender or its Applicable Lending Office to honor 
its obligation to make or maintain LIBOR Loans hereunder, then such Lender 
shall promptly notify the Borrower thereof and such Lenders obligation to 
make LIBOR Loans shall be suspended until such time as such Lender may 
again make and maintain LIBOR Loans (in which case the provisions of 
Section 5.04 shall be applicable).


Section 5.04 Base Rate Loans Pursuant to Sections 5.01, 5.02 and 5.03.

If the obligation of any Lender to make LIBOR Loans shall be suspended 
pursuant to Sections 5.01, 5.02 or 5.03 (Affected Loans), all Affected 
Loans which would otherwise be made by such Lender shall be made instead as 
Base Rate Loans (and, if an event referred to in Section 5.01(a) or 
Section 5.03 has occurred and such Lender so requests by notice to the 
Borrower, all Affected Loans of such Lender then outstanding shall be 
automatically converted into Base Rate Loans on the date specified by such 
Lender in such notice) and, to the extent that Affected Loans are so made 
as (or converted into) Base Rate Loans, all payments of principal which 
would otherwise be applied to such Lenders Affected Loans shall be applied 
instead to its Base Rate Loans.


Section 5.05 Compensation.

The Borrower shall pay to each Lender within thirty (30) days of receipt of 
written request of such Lender (which request shall set forth, in 
reasonable detail, the basis for requesting such amounts and which shall be 
conclusive and binding for all purposes provided that such determinations 
are made on a reasonable basis), such amount or amounts as shall compensate 
it for any loss, cost, expense or liability which such Lender determines 
are attributable to:

(i) any payment, prepayment or conversion of a LIBOR Loan properly made by 
such Lender or the Borrower for any reason (including, without limitation, 
the acceleration of the Loans pursuant to Section 10.01) on a date other 
than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan; or

(ii) any failure by the Borrower for any reason (including but not limited 
to, the failure of any of the conditions precedent specified in Article VI 
to be satisfied) to borrow, continue or convert a LIBOR Loan from such 
Lender on the date for such borrowing, continuation or conversion specified 
in the relevant notice given pursuant to Section 2.02(c).


Without limiting the effect of the preceding sentence, such compensation 
shall include an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of 
interest which would have accrued on the principal amount so paid, prepaid 
or converted or not borrowed for the period from the date of such payment, 
prepayment or conversion or failure to borrow to the last day of the 
Interest Period for such Loan (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, the 
Interest Period for such Loan which would have commenced on the date 
specified for such borrowing) at the applicable rate of interest for such 
Loan provided for herein over (ii) the interest component of the amount 
such Lender would have bid in the London interbank market for Dollar 
deposits of leading banks in amounts comparable to such principal amount 
and with maturities comparable to such period (as reasonably determined by 
such Lender).


Section 5.06 Replacement Lenders; Mitigation Obligations.

(a) Designation of a Different Lending Office. If any Lender requests 
compensation under Section 5.01, or the Borrower is required to pay any 
additional amount to
 
33

------------------------------------------------------------------------
any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender 
pursuant to Section 4.06, or if any Lender gives a notice pursuant to 
Section 5.03, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a 
different Lending Office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to 
assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, 
branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such 
designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable 
pursuant to Section 4.06 or 5.01, as the case may be, in the future, or 
eliminate the need for the notice pursuant to Section 5.03, as applicable, 
and (ii) in each case, would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed 
cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. 
The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses 
incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or 
assignment.

(b) Replacement of Lenders. If any Lender requests compensation under 
Section 5.01, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount 
to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender 
pursuant to Section 4.06, or if any Lender defaults in its obligation to 
fund Loans hereunder, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and 
effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require 
such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with 
and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by, 
Section 12.05, all of its interests, rights and obligations under this 
Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an assignee that shall assume 
such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts 
such assignment), provided, that:

(i) the Borrower shall have paid to the Administrative Agent the assignment 
fee specified in Section 12.05.

(ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the 
outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in Letters of Credit, 
accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it 
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including any amounts under 
Section 5.05 from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal 
and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other 
amounts);

(iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for 
compensation under Section 5.01 or payments required to be made pursuant to 
Section 4.06, such assignment will result in a reduction in such 
compensation or payments thereafter; and

(iv) such assignment does not conflict with applicable law.

A Lender shall not be required to make such assignment or delegation if, 
prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the 
circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and 
delegation cease to apply.

occasion of each borrowing hereunder and to issue, renew, extend or reissue

of a Letter of Credit by the Borrower hereunder shall constitute a 
certification by the Borrower to the effect set forth in Section 6.02(c) 
(both as of the date of such notice and, unless the Borrower otherwise

------------------------------------------------------------------------
All conditions precedent to the obligations of the Lenders to make any Loan 
are imposed hereby solely for the benefit of the Lenders, and no other 
Person may require satisfaction of any such condition precedent or be 
entitled to assume that the Lenders will refuse to make any Loan in the 
absence of strict compliance with such conditions precedent.


Section 6.04 No Waiver.

No waiver of any condition precedent shall preclude the Administrative 
Agent or the Lenders from requiring such condition to be met prior to

precedent constitutes a Default.



ARTICLE VII


Representations and Warranties


Each of the Obligors represents and warrants to the Administrative Agent 
and the Lenders that (each representation and warranty herein is given as 
of the Closing Date and shall be deemed repeated and reaffirmed on the

Letter of Credit as provided in Section 6.02):


Section 7.01 Corporate Existence.

which involves the possibility of any judgment or liability against any 
Obligor or any Subsidiary not fully covered by insurance (except for normal 
deductibles), and which would have a Material Adverse Effect.


Section 7.04 No Breach.

Neither the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents, nor compliance 
with the terms and provisions hereof will conflict with or result in a 
breach of, or require any consent which has not been obtained as of the 
Closing Date under, the respective charter or by-laws of the Obligors or 
any Subsidiary, or any Governmental Requirement or any agreement or 
instrument to which any Obligor or any Subsidiary is a party or by which it 
is bound or to which it or its Properties are subject, or constitute a

which it is a party, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate 
action on its part; and the Loan Documents constitute the legal, valid and 
binding obligations of each Obligor, enforceable in accordance with their 
terms.


Section 7.06 Approvals.

No authorizations, approvals or consents of, and no filings or 
registrations with, any Governmental Authority or any other Person are

general company purposes of the Borrower and Guarantors, and (v) to 
refinance Southern Bay Oil & Gas, L.P.s existing revolving credit facility

other Obligor is engaged principally, or as one of its important 
activities, in the business of extending credit for the purpose, whether 
immediate, incidental or ultimate, of buying or carrying margin stock 
(within the meaning of Regulation T, U or X of the Board of Governors of 
the Federal Reserve System) and no part of the proceeds of any Loan

actuarial present value of the benefit liabilities shall have the meaning 
specified in section 4041 of ERISA.

(g) None of the Obligors, any Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate sponsors, 
maintains, or contributes to an employee welfare benefit plan, as defined

filed all United States federal income tax returns and all other tax 
returns which are required to be filed by them and have paid all material

to its material (individually or in the aggregate) Properties, free and 
clear of all Liens, except Liens permitted by Section 9.02. After giving 
full effect to the Excepted Liens, each Obligor owns the net interests in 
production attributable to its Hydrocarbon Interests reflected in the most 
recently delivered Reserve Report and the ownership of such Properties 
shall not in any material respect obligate such Obligor to bear the costs 
and expenses relating to the maintenance, development and operations of 
each such Property in an amount in excess of the working interest of each 
Property set forth in the most recently delivered Reserve Report. All 
information contained in the most recently delivered Reserve Report is true 
and correct in all material respects as of the date thereof.

(b) All leases and agreements necessary for the conduct of the business of 
each Obligor and its Subsidiaries are valid and subsisting, in full force 
and effect and there exists no default or event or circumstance which with

respect the conduct of the business of any Obligor and its Subsidiaries.

(c) The rights, Properties and other assets presently owned, leased or 
licensed by each Obligor and its Subsidiaries including, without 
limitation, all easements and rights of way, include all rights, Properties

business has been conducted prior to the Closing Date.

which are reasonably necessary for the operation of its business are in 
good working condition and are maintained in accordance with prudent

material fact or any fact necessary to make the statement contained therein 
not materially misleading in the light of the circumstances in which made 
and with respect to the Obligors and their Subsidiaries taken as a whole. 
There is no fact peculiar to any Obligor or any Subsidiary which has a 
Material Adverse Effect or in the future is reasonably likely to have (so 
far as the Obligors can now foresee) a Material Adverse Effect and which 
has not been set forth in this Agreement or the other documents, 
certificates and statements furnished to the Administrative Agent by or on 
behalf of the Obligors or any Subsidiary prior to, or on, the Closing Date

circumstance occurred which, but for the expiration of any applicable grace 
period or the giving of notice, or both, would constitute a default under 
any Material Agreement or instrument to which any Obligor or any Subsidiary 
is a party or by which any Obligor or any Subsidiary is bound. No Default

take such actions would not have a Material Adverse Effect):

(a) Neither any Property of any Obligor or any Subsidiary nor the 
operations conducted thereon violate any order or requirement of any court 
or Governmental Authority or any Environmental Laws;

(b) Without limitation of clause (a) above, no Property of any Obligor or 
any Subsidiary nor the operations currently conducted thereon or, to the 
best knowledge of the Obligors, by any prior owner or operator of such 
Property or operation, are in violation of or Subject to any existing, 
pending or threatened action, suit, investigation, inquiry or proceeding by 
or before any court or Governmental Authority or to any remedial 
obligations under Environmental Laws;

(c) All notices, permits, licenses or similar authorizations, if any, 
required to be obtained or filed in connection with the operation or use of 
any and all Property of the Obligors and each Subsidiary, including without 
limitation past or present treatment, storage, disposal or release of a 
hazardous substance or solid waste into the environment, have been duly 
obtained or filed, and the Obligors and each Subsidiary are in compliance 
with the terms and conditions of all such notices, permits, licenses and 
similar authorizations;

(d) All hazardous substances, solid waste, and oil and gas exploration and 
production wastes, if any, generated at any and all Property of any Obligor 
or any Subsidiary have in the past been transported, treated and disposed 
of in accordance with Environmental Laws and so as not to pose an imminent 
and substantial endangerment to public health or welfare or the 
environment, and, to the best knowledge of the Obligors, all such transport 
carriers and treatment and disposal facilities have been and are operating 
in compliance with Environmental Laws and so as not to pose an imminent and 
substantial endangerment to public health or welfare or the environment, 
and are not the subject of any existing, pending or threatened action, 
investigation or inquiry by any Governmental Authority in connection with 
any Environmental Laws;
 
41

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(e) The Obligors have taken all steps reasonably necessary to determine and 
have determined that no hazardous substances, solid waste, or oil and gas 
exploration and production wastes, have been disposed of or otherwise 
released and there has been no threatened release of any hazardous 
substances on or to any Property of any Obligor or any Subsidiary except in 
compliance with Environmental Laws and so as not to pose an imminent and

(f) To the extent applicable, all Property of the Obligors and each 
Subsidiary currently satisfies all design, operation, and equipment 
requirements imposed by the OPA or scheduled as of the Closing Date to be 
imposed by OPA during the term of this Agreement, and the Obligors do not 
have any reason to believe that such Property, to the extent subject to 
OPA, will not be able to maintain compliance with the OPA requirements 
during the term of this Agreement; and

(g) None of the Obligors nor any Subsidiary has any known contingent 
liability in connection with any release or threatened release of any oil, 
hazardous substance or solid waste into the environment.


Section 7.18 Compliance with the Law.

None of the Obligors nor any Subsidiary has violated any Governmental 
Requirement or failed to obtain any license, permit, franchise or other 
governmental authorization necessary for the ownership of any of its 
Properties or the conduct of its business, which violation or failure would 
have (in the event such violation or failure were asserted by any Person 
through appropriate action) a Material Adverse Effect. Except for such acts 
or failures to act as would not have a Material Adverse Effect, the Oil and 
Gas Properties of the Obligors (and properties unitized therewith) have 
been maintained, operated and developed in a good and workmanlike manner 
and in conformity with all applicable laws and all rules, regulations and 
orders of all duly constituted authorities having jurisdiction and in 
conformity with the provisions of all leases, subleases or other contracts 
comprising a part of the Hydrocarbon Interests and other contracts and 
agreements forming a part of such Oil and Gas Properties; specifically in 
this connection, (i) after the Closing Date, no Oil and Gas Property of any 
Obligor is subject to having allowable production reduced below the full 
and regular allowable (including the maximum permissible tolerance) because 
of any overproduction (whether or not the same was permissible at the time)

the Oil and Gas Properties of any Obligor (or properties unitized 
therewith) are deviated from the vertical more than the maximum permitted 
by applicable laws, regulations, rules and orders, and such wells are, in

properties unitized therewith, such unitized properties).


Section 7.19 Insurance.

Schedule 7.19 attached hereto contains an accurate and complete description 
of all material policies of fire, liability, workers compensation and 
other forms of insurance owned or held by the Obligors and each Subsidiary. 
All such policies are in full force and effect, all premiums with respect 
thereto covering all periods up to and including the date of the closing 
have been paid, and no notice of cancellation or termination has been 
received with respect to any such policy. Such policies are sufficient for 
compliance with all requirements of law and of all agreements to which any 
Obligor or any Subsidiary is a party; are valid, outstanding and 
enforceable policies; provide adequate insurance coverage in at least such 
amounts and against at least such risks (but including in any event public 
liability) as are usually insured against in the same general area by 
companies engaged in the same or a similar business for the assets and 
operations of the Obligors and each Subsidiary; will remain in full force 
and effect through the respective
 
42

------------------------------------------------------------------------
dates set forth in Schedule 7.19 without the payment of additional 
premiums; and will not in any way be affected by, or terminate or lapse by 
reason of, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Schedule 7.19 
identifies all material risks, if any, which each Obligor and its 
Subsidiaries and their respective Board of Directors or officers have 
designated as being self insured. None of the Obligors nor any Subsidiary 
has been refused any insurance with respect to its assets or operations, 
nor has its coverage been limited below usual and customary policy limits, 
by an insurance carrier to which it has applied for any such insurance or 
with which it has carried insurance during the last three years.

Obligors and each Subsidiary, the material terms thereof (including the 
type, term, effective date, termination date and notional amounts or 
volumes), the net mark to market value thereof, all credit support 
agreements relating thereto (including any margin required or supplied), 
and the counter party to each such agreement.


Section 7.21 Restriction on Liens.

None of the Obligors nor any of their Subsidiaries is a party to any 
agreement or arrangement (other than this Agreement and the Security 
Instruments), or subject to any order, judgment, writ or decree, which 
either restricts or purports to restrict its ability to grant Liens to 
other Persons on or in respect of their respective assets or Properties.


Section 7.22 Material Agreements.

Set forth on Schedule 7.22 is a complete list of all agreements, leases, 
indentures, purchase agreements, obligations in respect of letters of 
credit, guarantees, joint venture agreements, and other instruments which 
are material to Obligors business, activities, and operation or ownership 
of Obligors Property (the Material Agreements) in effect or to be in 
effect as of the Closing Date (other than Hedging Agreements) providing 
for, evidencing, securing or otherwise relating to any Debt of any Obligor 
or any of its Subsidiaries, and all obligations of any Obligor or any 
Subsidiaries to issuers of surety or appeal bonds issued for account of any 
Obligor or any such Subsidiary. The Borrower shall also make available to 
Administrative Agent and Lenders all Material Agreements and other 
agreements and instruments (excluding any such agreements and other 
instruments that are cancelable upon 60 or less days notice) of each 
Obligor and its Subsidiaries relating to the purchase, transportation by 
pipeline, gas processing, marketing, sale and supply of natural gas and 
other Hydrocarbons, but in any event, any such agreement or other 
instrument that will account for more than 10% of the sales of the 
Obligors and their Subsidiaries during the Borrowers current fiscal year. 
Upon request by Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall deliver, or caused 
to be delivered, to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders a complete and 
correct copy of all such material credit agreements, indentures, purchase 
agreements, contracts, letters of credit, guarantees, joint venture 
agreements, or other instruments, including any modifications or 
supplements thereto, as in effect on the Closing Date.


Section 7.23 Gas Imbalances.

As of the Closing Date, except as set forth on Schedule 7.23 or on the most 
recent certificate delivered pursuant to Section 8.07(c), on a net basis 
there are no gas imbalances, take or pay or other prepayments with respect 
to the Obligors Oil and Gas Properties which would require the Obligors to 
deliver, in the aggregate, five percent (5%) or more of the monthly 
production from Hydrocarbons produced from their Oil and Gas Properties at 
some future time without then or thereafter receiving fall payment 
therefor.

their business activities and their financial resources; and each Obligor

financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally 
engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other 
Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not the Administrative Agent 
hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders.


Section 11.03 Exculpatory Provisions.

The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except 
those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents. Without 
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent:

regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing;

(b) shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise 
any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly

take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may 
expose the Administrative Agent to liability or that is contrary to any 
Loan Document or applicable law; and

(c) shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan 
Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the

The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not 
taken by it (i) with the consent or at the request of Majority Lenders (or

the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, 
under the circumstances as provided in Sections 12.04 and 10.02) or (ii) in 
the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. The 
Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default 
unless and until notice describing such Default is given to the 
Administrative Agent by the Borrower, a Lender or the Issuing Bank.


The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to 
ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation

consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any 
electronic message, internet or intranet website posting or other 
distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or 
otherwise authenticated by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent also 
may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed 
by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any 
liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition 
hereunder to the making of a Loan, or the issuance of a Letter of Credit, 
that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender or the 
Issuing Bank, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is 
satisfactory to such Lender or the Issuing Bank unless the Administrative 
Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender or the 
Issuing Bank prior to the making of such Loan or the issuance of such 
Letter of Credit. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel 
(who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other

taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants 
or experts.

its
 
59

duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective 
Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to

notice of resignation, Majority Lenders shall have the right, in 
consultation with the Borrower, to appoint a successor, which shall be a 
bank with an office in the United States, or an Affiliate of any such bank 
with an office in the United States. If no such successor shall have been 
so appointed by Majority Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment 
within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its 
resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may on behalf of the 
Lenders and the Issuing Bank, appoint a successor Administrative Agent

qualifying Person has accepted such appointment, then such resignation 
shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice and (1) 
the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and 
obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (except that in 
the case of any collateral security held by the Administrative Agent on 
behalf of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank under any of the Loan Documents, 
the retiring Administrative Agent shall continue to hold such collateral 
security until such time as a successor Administrative Agent is appointed) 
and (2) all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made 
by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to 
each Lender and the Issuing Bank directly, until such time as Majority 
Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided for above in 
this Section. Upon the acceptance of a successors appointment as 
Administrative Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become 
vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the 
retiring (or retired) Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative 
Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder 
or under the other Loan Documents (if not already discharged therefrom as

and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Article and 
Section 12.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring 
Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties 
in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while 
the retiring Administrative Agent was acting as Administrative Agent.


Any resignation by Wachovia Bank, National Association as Administrative 
Agent pursuant to this Section shall also constitute its resignation as 
Issuing Bank. Upon the acceptance of a successors appointment as 
Administrative Agent hereunder, (a) such successor shall succeed to and 
become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the 
retiring Issuing Bank, (b) the retiring Issuing Bank shall be discharged 
from all of their respective duties and obligations hereunder or under the 
other Loan Documents, and (c) the successor Issuing Bank shall issue 
letters of credit in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any, 
outstanding at the time of such succession or make other arrangements 
satisfactory to the retiring Issuing Bank to effectively assume the 
obligations of the retiring Issuing Bank with respect to such Letters of 
Credit.

and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender and the Issuing Bank 
also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the 
Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties

taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document 
or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.

of its Subsidiaries, or any Environmental Liability related in any way to 
the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iv) any actual or prospective 
claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the 
foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory, whether 
brought by a third party or by the Borrower or any other Obligor, and 
regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto, in all cases, 
whether or not caused by or arising, in whole or in part, out of the 
comparative, contributory or sole negligence of the Indemnitee; provided, 
that, such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the 
extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses 
(x) are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and 
nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or 
willful misconduct of such Indemnitee or (y) result from a claim brought by 
the Borrower or any other Obligor against an Indemnitee for breach in bad 
faith of such Indemnitees obligations hereunder or under any other Loan 
Document, if the Borrower or such Obligor has obtained a final and 
nonappealable judgment in its favor on such claim as determined by a court 
of competent jurisdiction.

(c) Reimbursement by Lenders. To the extent that the Borrower for any 
reason fails to indefeasibly pay any amount required under subsection (a) 
or (b) of this Section to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent (or any 
sub-agent thereof), the Issuing Bank or any Related Party of any of the 
foregoing, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent 
(or any such sub-agent), the Issuing Bank or such Related Party, as the 
case may be, such Lenders Commitment (determined as of the time that the 
applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such 
unpaid amount, provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, 
claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was 
incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent (or any such 
sub-agent) or the Issuing Bank in its capacity as such, or against any 
Related Party of any of the foregoing acting for the Administrative Agent 
(or any such sub-agent) or Issuing Bank in connection with such capacity. 
The obligations of the Lenders under this subsection (c) are subject to the 
provisions of Section 2.05.

(d) Waiver of Consequential Damages, Etc. To the fullest extent permitted 
by applicable law, the Borrower shall not assert, and hereby waives, any 
claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, 
indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual 
damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this 
Agreement, any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument 
contemplated hereby, the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, any 
Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof. No Indemnitee 
referred to in subsection (b) above shall be liable for any damages arising 
from the use by unintended recipients of any information or other materials 
distributed to such unintended recipients by such Indemnitee through 
telecommunications,

electronic or other information transmission systems in connection with

hereby or thereby.

(e) Payments. All amounts due under this Section shall be payable not later

Section 12.04 Amendments, Etc.

Any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document may be amended, 
modified or waived with the Obligors and the Majority Lenders prior 
written consent; provided that (i) no amendment, modification or waiver 
which extends the final maturity of the Loans, increases the Aggregate 
Maximum Revolving Credit Amounts, modifies the Borrowing Base, forgives the 
principal amount of any Indebtedness outstanding under this Agreement, 
releases any guarantor of the Indebtedness, or releases Security 
Instruments which in the aggregate cover more than five percent (5%) by 
value of the Mortgaged Property (as reflected on the most recent Reserve 
Report delivered under Section 8.07) during each Borrowing Base Period, 
reduces the interest rate applicable to the Loans or the fees payable to 
the Lenders generally, affects Section 2.03 (a), this Section 12.04 or 
Section 12.05 or modifies the definition of Majority Lenders shall be 
effective without consent of all Lenders; (ii) no amendment, modification 
or waiver which increases the Maximum Revolving Credit Amount of any Lender 
shall be effective without the consent of such Lender; and (iii) no 
amendment, modification or waiver which modifies the rights, duties or 
obligations of the Administrative Agent shall be effective without the 
consent of the Administrative Agent.


Section 12.05 Successors and Assigns.

(a) Successors and Assigns Generally. The provisions of this Agreement 
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and 
their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that 
neither the Borrower nor any other Obligors may assign or otherwise 
transfer any of their respective rights or obligations hereunder without 
the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent and each Lender and 
no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations 
hereunder except (i) to an assignee in accordance with the provisions of 
subsection (b) of this Section, (ii) by way of participation in accordance 
with the provisions of subsection (d) of this Section, or (iii) by way of 
pledge or assignment of a security interest subject to the restrictions of 
subsection (f) of this Section (and any other attempted assignment or 
transfer by any party hereto shall be null and void). Nothing in this 
Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any 
Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and 
assigns permitted hereby, Participants to the extent provided in 
subsection (d) of this Section and, to the extent expressly contemplated 
hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Administrative Agent, the 
Issuing Bank and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim 
under or by reason of this Agreement.

(b) Assignments by Lenders. Any Lender may at any time assign to one or 
more assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this 
Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans at 
the time owing to it); provided that any such assignment shall be subject 
to the following conditions:

(i) Minimum Amounts.

(A) in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the 
assigning Lenders Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it or in
 
64

------------------------------------------------------------------------
the case of an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an 
Approved Fund, no minimum amount need be assigned; and

(B) in any case not described in subsection (b)(i)(A) of this Section, the 
aggregate amount of the Commitment (which for this purpose includes Loans 
outstanding thereunder) or, if the Commitment is not then in effect, the 
principal outstanding balance of the Loans of the assigning Lender subject 
to each such assignment, determined as of the date the Assignment and 
Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the 
Administrative Agent or, if Trade Date is specified in the Assignment and 
Assumption, as of the Trade Date, shall not be less than $1,000,000 unless 
each of the Administrative Agent and, so long as no Event of Default has 
occurred and is continuing, the Borrower otherwise consents (each such 
consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided, however, 
that concurrent assignments to members of an Assignee Group and concurrent 
assignments from members of an Assignee Group to a single assignee (or to 
an assignee and members of its Assignee Group) will be treated as a single 
assignment for purposes of determining whether such minimum amount has been 
met.

(ii) Proportionate Amounts. Each partial assignment shall be made as an 
assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lenders rights and 
obligations under this Agreement with respect to the Loans or the 
Commitment assigned.

(iii) Required Consents. No consent shall be required for any assignment 
except to the extent required by subsection (b)(i)(B) of this Section and, 
in addition:

(A) the consent of the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably 
withheld or delayed) shall be required unless (1) an Event of Default has 
occurred and is continuing at the time of such assignment or (2) such 
assignment is to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund;

(B) the consent of the Administrative Agent (such consent not to be 
unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required if such assignment is 
to a Person that is not a Lender, an Affiliate of such Lender or an 
Approved Fund with respect to such Lender;

(C) the consent of the Issuing Bank (such consent not to be unreasonably 
withheld or delayed) shall be required for any assignment that increases 
the obligation of the assignee to participate in exposure under one or more 
Letters of Credit (whether or not then outstanding); and

(iv) Assignment and Assumption. The parties to each assignment shall 
execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and 
Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee in the amount, 
if any, required as set forth in Schedule 12.05; provided, however, that 
the Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion, elect to waive such 
processing and recordation fee in the case of any assignment. The assignee, 
if it is not a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an 
Administrative Questionnaire.

(v) No Assignment to Borrower. No such assignment shall be made to the 
Borrower or any of the Borrowers Affiliates or Subsidiaries.
 
65

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(vi) No Assignment to Natural Persons. No such assignment shall be made to 
a natural person.


Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent 
pursuant to subsection (c) of this Section, from and after the effective 
date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the assignee thereunder 
shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest 
assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations 
of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder 
shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and 
Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in 
the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning 
Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall 
cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be entitled to the 
benefits of Sections 4.06, 5.01, 5.05, and 12.03 with respect to facts and 
circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment. 
Upon request, the Borrower (at its expense) shall execute and deliver a 
Note to the assignee Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of 
rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this 
subsection shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by 
such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance 
with subsection (d) of this Section.

(c) Register. The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as 
an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at the Administrative Agents 
Office a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a 
register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and 
the Commitments of, and principal amounts of the Loans and L/C Exposure 
owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the 
Register). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the 
Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person 
whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a 
Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice 
to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the 
Borrower and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon 
reasonable prior notice.

(d) Participations. Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or 
notice to, the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to 
any Person (other than a natural person or the Borrower or any of the 
Borrowers Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a Participant) in all or a 
portion of such Lenders rights and/or obligations under this Agreement 
(including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or the Loans (including 
such Lenders participations in L/C Exposure owing to it); provided that 
(i) such Lenders obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, 
(ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties 
hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the 
Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Issuing Bank shall continue to 
deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lenders 
rights and obligations under this Agreement.

Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a 
participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to 
enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver 
of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or 
instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of 
the Participant, agree to any amendment, waiver or other modification 
described in the first proviso to Section 12.04 that affects such 
Participant. Subject to subsection (e) of this Section, the Borrower agrees 
that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 4.06, 
5.01 and 5.05 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired 
its interest by assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section. To 
the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the 
benefits of Section 4.05(a) as though it were a Lender, provided such 
Participant agrees to be subject to Section 4.05(b) as though it were a 
Lender.
 
66

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(e) Limitations upon Participant Rights. A Participant shall not be 
entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 4.06 or 5.01 than the 
applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the 
participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the 
participation to such Participant is made with the Borrowers prior written 
consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender 
shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 4.06 unless the Borrower 
is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such 
Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with 
Section 4.06 as though it were a Lender.

(f) Certain Pledges. Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security 
interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement 
(including under its Note, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, 
including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal 
Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such 
Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee 
or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.


Section 12.06 [Reserved].

Section 12.07 Invalidity.

In the event that any one or more of the provisions contained in any of the 
Loan Documents shall, for any reason, be held invalid, illegal or 
unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or 
unenforceability shall not affect any other provision of the Notes, this 
Agreement or any other Loan Document.


Section 12.08 Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness; Electronic 
Execution.

(a) Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be 
executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto in different 
counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which 
when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement and 
the other Loan Documents constitute the entire contract among the parties 
relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous 
agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject 
matter hereof. Except as provided in Section 6.01, this Agreement shall 
become effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative 
Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts 
hereof that, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other 
parties hereto. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of 
this Agreement by telecopy shall be effective as delivery of a manually 
executed counterpart of this Agreement.

(b) Electronic Execution of Assignments. The words execution, signed, 
signature, and words of like import in any Assignment and Assumption 
shall be deemed to include electronic signatures or the keeping of records 
in electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, 
validity or enforceability as a manually executed signature or the use of a 
paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the extent and as 
provided for in any applicable law, including the Federal Electronic 
Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, the New York State 
Electronic Signatures and Records Act, or any other similar state laws 
based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act.

when used in this Agreement refer to this Agreement as a whole, and not to 
any particular article, section or subsection. Any reference herein to a 
Section or Article shall be deemed to refer to the applicable Section or 
Article of this Agreement unless otherwise stated herein. Any reference 
herein to an exhibit, schedule, or other attachment shall be deemed to 
refer to the applicable exhibit, schedule, or other attachment attached 
hereto unless otherwise stated herein. The words including, includes 
and words of similar import mean including, without limitation.


Section 12.10 Survival.

The obligations of the parties under Section 4.06, Article V, and Sections 
11.05 and 12.03 shall survive the repayment of the Loans and the 
termination of the Commitments. To the extent that any payments on the 
Indebtedness or proceeds of any collateral are subsequently invalidated, 
declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required to be 
repaid to a trustee, debtor in possession, receiver or other Person under 
any bankruptcy law, common law or equitable cause, then to such extent, the 
Indebtedness so satisfied shall be revived and continue as if such payment 
or proceeds had not been received and the Administrative Agents and the 
Lenders Liens, security interests, rights, powers and remedies under this 
Agreement and each Security Instrument shall continue in full force and 
effect. In such event, each Security Instrument shall be automatically 
reinstated and the Obligors shall take such action as may be reasonably 
requested by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders to effect such 
reinstatement.


Section 12.11 Captions.

Captions and section headings appearing herein are included solely for 
convenience of reference and are not intended to affect the interpretation 
of any provision of this Agreement.


Section 12.12 No Oral Agreements.

The loan documents embody the entire agreement and understanding between 
the parties and supersede all other agreements and understandings between 
such parties relating to the subject matter hereof and thereof. The loan 
documents represent the final agreement between the parties and may not be 
contradicted by evidence of prior, contemporaneous or subsequent oral 
agreements of the parties. There are no unwritten oral agreements between 
the parties.


Section 12.13 Governing law, Submission to Jurisdiction.

(a) This agreement and the notes shall be governed by, and construed in 
accordance with, the laws of the state of Texas except to the extent that 
United States federal law permits any lender to charge interest at the rate 
allowed by the laws of the state where such lender is located. Ch. 346 of 
the Texas Finance Code (which regulates certain revolving credit loan 
accounts and revolving tri-party accounts) shall not apply to this 
agreement or the notes.

(b) Any legal action or proceeding with respect to the loan documents shall 
be brought in the courts of the state of Texas or of the United States of 
America for the Southern District of Texas, and, by execution and delivery 
of this Agreement, the Borrower and each Guarantor hereby accepts for 
itself and (to the extent permitted by law) in respect of its property, 
generally and unconditionally, the jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts. 
The Borrower and each Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives any objection, 
including, without limitation, any objection to the laying of venue or 
based on the grounds of forum non conveniens, which it may now or hereafter 
have to the bringing of any such action or proceeding in such respective 
jurisdictions. This submission to jurisdiction is non-exclusive and does 
not preclude the Administrative Agent
 
68

------------------------------------------------------------------------
or any Lender from obtaining jurisdiction over the Borrower or any 
Guarantor in any court otherwise having jurisdiction.

(c) The Borrower and each Guarantor hereby irrevocably designates [         
   ], as the designee, appointee and administrative agent of the Borrower 
and each Guarantor to receive, for and on behalf of the Borrower and each 
Guarantor, service of process in such respective jurisdictions in any legal 
action or proceeding with respect to the Loan Documents. It is understood 
that a copy of such process served on such administrative agent will be 
promptly forwarded by overnight courier to the Borrower and the relevant 
Guarantor at their addresses set forth under its signature below, but the 
failure of the Borrower or such Guarantor to receive such copy shall not 
affect in any way the service of such process. The Borrower and each 
Guarantor further irrevocably consents to the service of process of any of 
the aforementioned courts in any such action or proceeding by the mailing 
of copies thereof by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to the 
Borrower and any Guarantor at its said address, such service to become 
effective thirty (30) days after such mailing.

(d) Nothing herein shall affect the right of the Administrative Agent or 
any Lender or any holder of a note to serve process in any other manner 
permitted by law or to commence legal proceedings or otherwise proceed 
against the Borrower or any Guarantor in any other jurisdiction.

(e) The Borrower, each Guarantor and each Lender hereby (i) irrevocably and 
unconditionally waive, to the fullest extent permitted by law, trial by 
jury in any legal action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any 
Security Instrument and for any counterclaim therein; (ii) irrevocably 
waive, to the maximum extent not prohibited by law, any right it may have 
to claim or recover in any such litigation any special, exemplary, punitive 
or consequential damages, or damages other than, or in addition to, actual 
damages; (iii) certify that no party hereto nor any representative of 
administrative agent or counsel for any party hereto has represented, 
expressly or otherwise, or implied that such party would not, in the event 
of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waivers, and (iv) acknowledge 
that it has been induced to enter into this Agreement, the Security 
Instruments and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby by, among 
other things, the mutual waivers and certifications contained in this S
ection 12.13.


Section 12.14 Interest.

It is the intention of the parties hereto to conform strictly to Applicable 
Usury Laws regarding the use, forbearance or detention of the indebtedness 
evidenced by this Agreement, the Notes and the other Loan Documents, 
whether such laws are now or hereafter in effect, including the laws of the 
United States or any other jurisdiction whose laws are applicable, and 
including any subsequent revisions to or judicial interpretations of those 
laws, in each case to the extent they are applicable to this Agreement, the 
Notes and the other Loan Documents (the Applicable Usury Laws). 
Accordingly, if any acceleration of the maturity of the Notes or any 
payment by Borrower or any other Person produces a rate in excess of the 
Highest Lawful Rate or otherwise results in Borrower or such other Person 
being deemed to have paid any interest in excess of the Maximum Amount, as 
hereinafter defined, or if any Lender shall for any reason receive any 
unearned interest in violation of any Applicable Usury Laws, or if any 
transaction contemplated hereby would otherwise be usurious under any 
Applicable Usury Laws, then, in that event, regardless of any provision 
contained in this Agreement or any other Loan Document or other agreement 
or instrument executed or delivered in connection herewith, the provisions 
of this Section 12.14 shall govern and control, and neither Borrower nor 
any other Person shall be obligated to pay, or apply in any manner to, any 
amount that would be excessive interest. No Lender shall ever be deemed to 
have
 
69

------------------------------------------------------------------------
contracted for or be entitled to receive, collect, charge, reserve or apply 
as interest on any Loan (whether termed interest therein or deemed to be 
interest by judicial determination or operation of law), any amount in 
excess of the Highest Lawful Rate, and, in the event that such Lender ever 
receives, collects, or applies as interest any such excess, such amount 
which would be excessive interest shall be applied as a partial prepayment 
of principal and treated hereunder as such, and, if the principal amount of 
the applicable Loans are paid in full, any remaining excess shall forthwith 
be paid to Borrower. In determining whether or not the interest contracted 
for, received, collected, charged reserved, paid or payable, including 
under any specific contingency, exceeds the Highest Lawful Rate, Borrower 
and each Lender shall, to the maximum extent permitted under applicable 
law, (a) characterize any non-principal payment (other than payments which 
are expressly designated as interest payments hereunder) as an expense or 
fee rather than as interest, (b) exclude voluntary pre-payments and the 
effect thereof, and (c) amortize and spread the total amount of interest 
throughout the entire stated term of the Loans so that the interest rate is 
uniform throughout such term; provided that if the Loans are paid in full 
prior to the end of the full contemplated term hereof, and if the interest 
received for the actual period of existence thereof exceeds the Highest 
Lawful Rate, if any, then the Lenders shall refund to Borrower the amount 
of such excess, or credit the amount of such excess against the aggregate 
unpaid principal balance of all Loans made by Lender. As used herein, the 
term Maximum Amount means the maximum nonusurious amount of interest 
which may be lawfully contracted for, reserved, charged, collected or 
received by Lender in connection with the indebtedness evidenced by this 
Agreement, the Notes and other Loan Documents under all Applicable Usury 
Laws. Texas Finance Code, Chapter 346, which regulates certain revolving 
loan accounts and revolving tri-party accounts, shall not apply to any 
revolving loan accounts created under, or apply in any manner to, the Note, 
this Agreement or the other Loan Documents.


Section 12.15 Confidentiality.

Each of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Issuing Bank agrees 
to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), 
except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its Affiliates and to its 
and its Affiliates respective partners, directors, officers, employees, 
agents, advisors and representatives (it being understood that the Persons 
to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature 
of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential), 
(b) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority purporting to have 
jurisdiction over it (including any self-regulatory authority, such as the 
National Association of Insurance Commissioners), (c) to the extent 
required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar 
legal process, (d) to any other party hereto, (e) in connection with the 
exercise of any remedies hereunder or under any other Loan Document or any 
action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document 
or the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder, (f) subject to an 
agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this 
Section, to (i) any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective 
assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this 
Agreement or (ii) any actual or prospective counterparty (or its advisors) 
to any swap or derivative transaction relating to the Borrower and its 
obligations, (g) with the consent of the Borrower or (h) to the extent such 
Information (x) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a 
breach of this Section or (y) becomes available to the Administrative 
Agent, any Lender, the Issuing Bank or any of their respective Affiliates 
on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Borrower.


For purposes of this Section, Information means all information received 
from the Borrower or any Subsidiary relating to the Borrower or any 
Subsidiary or any of their respective businesses, other than any such 
information that is available to the Administrative Agent, any Lender or 
the Issuing Bank on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by the 
Borrower or any Subsidiary, provided that, in the case of information 
received from the Borrower or any Subsidiary after the date hereof, such 
information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential. 
Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as 
provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its
 
70

------------------------------------------------------------------------
obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to 
maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would 
accord to its own confidential information.


Each of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Issuing Bank 
acknowledges that (a) the Information may include material non-public 
information concerning the Borrower or a Subsidiary, as the case may be, 
(b) it has developed compliance procedures regarding the use of material 
non-public information and (c) it will handle such material non-public 
information in accordance with applicable Law, including Federal and state 
securities Laws.


Section 12.16 Disposition of Proceeds.

Certain of the Security Instruments contain an assignment by the Obligors 
unto and in favor of the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the 
Lenders of all production and all proceeds attributable thereto which may 
be produced from or allocated to the Mortgaged Property, and such Security 
Instruments further provide in general for the application of such proceeds 
to the satisfaction of the Indebtedness and other obligations described 
therein and secured thereby. Notwithstanding the assignment contained in 
such Security Instruments, so long as no Default exists, the Lenders agree 
that they will neither notify the purchaser or purchasers of such 
production nor take any other action to cause such proceeds to be remitted 
to the Lenders, but the Lenders will instead permit such proceeds to be 
paid to the Obligors.


Section 12.17 USA Patriot Act Notice.

Each Lender that is subject to the Act (as hereinafter defined) and the 
Administrative Agent (for itself and not on behalf of any Lender) hereby 
notifies the Obligors that pursuant to the requirements of the USA Patriot 
Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)) (the 
Act), it is required to obtain, verify and record information that 
identifies the Borrower, which information includes the name and address of 
the Borrower and other information that will allow such Lender or the 
Administrative Agent, as applicable, to identify the Borrower in accordance 
with the Act.
