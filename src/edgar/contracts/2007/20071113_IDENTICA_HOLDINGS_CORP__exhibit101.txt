            14.3.2
            Forty thousand (40,000) dollars, plus a Note and payment

            Such other certificates and documents as may be called for by

              SECTION 15.
              RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS SUBSEQUENT TO CLOSING
      15.1
      BOOKS AND RECORDS.  This sale does not include the books of account
      and records of Seller's business.  However, possession and custody of
      such books and records, except for Seller's general ledger, may be
      retained by Buyer for a period of six (6) months.  During this
      period, Seller or its agents shall have access to such books and
      records and may make copies thereof.  Buyer will exercise reasonable
      care in the safekeeping of such records.  Seller shall retain its
      general ledger but shall make it available for inspection by Buyer
      from time to time upon reasonable request.
      15.2
      SELLER'S RIGHT TO PAY.  In the event Buyer fails to make any payment
      of taxes, assessments, insurance premiums, or other charges that
      Buyer is required to pay to third parties under this Agreement,
      Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to pay the same.
       Buyer will reimburse Seller for any such payment immediately upon
      Seller's demand, together with interest at the same rate provided in
      the Note from the date of Seller's payment until Buyer reimburses
      Seller.  Any such payment by Seller shall not constitute a waiver by
      Seller of any remedy available by reason of Buyer's default for
      failure to make the payments.
      SECTION 16.  BULK SALES ACT.
Buyer waives compliance by Seller with the Bulk Sales Act, if any (the 
Act).  In the event any creditor of Seller claims the benefit of the Bulk 
Sales Act as against Buyer or any of

the assets being conveyed to Buyer under this Agreement, Seller and Selling 
Shareholders shall immediately pay or otherwise satisfy such claim or 
undertake its defense.  Seller and Selling Shareholders shall indemnify and 
hold Buyer harmless from and against any and all loss, expense, or damage 
resulting from the failure to comply with the Bulk Transfer law.  If Seller 
fails to comply with the provision of this Section 16 and Buyer is required 
to pay any creditor of Seller in order to protect the property purchased 
under this agreement from claims or liens of Seller's creditors, except 
those assumed by Buyer, the Buyer may offset the amount it pays against the 
balance due Seller by furnishing to the Seller proof of such payment in the 
form of a receipt from the creditor involved.
      SECTION 17. TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT
      17.1
      BY MUTUAL CONSENT.
      This Agreement may be terminated by mutual written consent of Buyer
      and Seller.
      17.2
      BREACH OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES; FAILURE OF CONDITIONS. 
      Buyer may elect by notice to Seller, and Seller may elect by notice
      to Buyer, to terminate this Agreement if;
            17.2.1
            The terminating party shall have discovered a material error,
            misstatement, or omission in the representations and warranties
            made in this Agreement by the other party which shall not have
            been cured by such other party within fifteen (15) days after
            written notice to such other party specifying in detail such
            asserted error, misstatement, or omission, or by the closing
            date, whichever first occurs.
            17.2.2
            All of the conditions precedent of the terminating party's
            obligations under this Agreement as set forth in either Section
            10 or 11, as the case may be, have not

            occurred and have not been waived by the terminating party on
            or prior to the closing date.
      17.3
      CLOSING NOTWITHSTANDING THE RIGHT TO TERMINATE.  The party with a
      right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 17.2.1 or
      17.2.2 shall not be bound to exercise such right, and its failure to
      exercise such right shall not constitute a waiver of any other right
      it may have under this Agreement, including but not limited to
      remedies for breach of a representation, warranty, or covenant.
      SECTION 18. MISCELLANEOUS
      18.1
