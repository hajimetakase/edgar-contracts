GLOBAL SHIP LEASE, INC.
EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN

SECTION 1. INTRODUCTION.

On October 31, 2007 the Board adopted this Global Ship Lease, Inc. 2007 
Equity Incentive Plan, which shall become effective upon its approval by 
the Companys stockholders (the Effective Date).

The purpose of this Plan is to promote the long-term success of the Company 
and the creation of stockholder value by offering Key Service Providers the 
opportunity to share in such long-term success by acquiring a proprietary 
interest in the Company.

The Plan seeks to achieve this purpose by providing for discretionary 
long-term incentive Awards in the form of Options, Stock Appreciation 
Rights, Stock Grants and Stock Units.

The Plan shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws 
of the Republic of the Marshall Islands (except its choice-of-law 
provisions). Capitalized terms shall have the meaning provided in Section 2 
unless otherwise provided in this Plan or any related Award Agreement.

SECTION 2. DEFINITIONS.

(a) Affiliate means any entity other than a Subsidiary, if the Company 
and/or one or more Subsidiaries own not less than 50% of such entity.

(b) Award means an Option, SAR, Stock Grant or Stock Unit.

(c) Award Agreement means any Stock Option Agreement, SAR Agreement, 
Stock Grant Agreement or Stock Unit Agreement.

(d) Board means the Board of Directors of the Company, as constituted 
from time to time.

(e) Cashless Exercise means, to the extent that a Stock Option Agreement 
so provides and as permitted by applicable law, a program approved by the 
Committee in which payment of the aggregate Exercise Price and/or 
satisfaction of any applicable tax or withholding obligations may be made 
all or in part by delivery (on a form prescribed by the Committee) of an 
irrevocable direction to a securities broker to sell Shares subject to an 
Option and to deliver all or part of the sale proceeds to the Company.

(f) Cause means, except as may otherwise be provided in a Participants 
Award Agreement, (i) Participants willful failure to perform his or her 
duties and responsibilities to the Company or material violation of a 
written Company policy; (ii) Participants commission of any act of fraud, 
embezzlement, dishonesty or any other willful misconduct that has caused or 
is reasonably expected to result in material injury to
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------


the Company; (iii) unauthorized use or disclosure by Participant of any 
proprietary information or trade secrets of the Company or any other party 
to whom the Participant owes an obligation of nondisclosure as a result of 
his or her relationship with the Company; or (iv) Participants willful 
breach of any of his or her obligations under any written agreement or 
covenant with the Company. The determination as to whether a Participant is 
being terminated for Cause shall be made in good faith by the Committee and 
shall be conclusive and binding on the Participant. The foregoing 
definition does not in any way limit the Companys ability to terminate a 
Participants Service at any time as provided in Section 12(a), and the 
term Company will be interpreted to include any Subsidiary, Parent, 
Affiliate, or any successor thereto, if appropriate.

(g) Change in Control means the consummation of any of the following 
transactions:

(i) The sale of all or substantially all of the Companys assets;

(ii) The merger of the Company with or into another corporation in which 
securities possessing more than 50% of the total combined voting power of 
the Company are transferred to a person or persons different from the 
persons holding those securities immediately prior to such transaction; or

(iii) The acquisition, directly or indirectly, by any person or related 
group of persons (other than the Company or a person that directly or 
indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, the 
Company) of beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 of the 
Exchange Act) of securities of the Company representing more than 50% of 
the total combined voting power of the Companys then outstanding 
securities pursuant to a tender or exchange offer made directly to the 
Companys stockholders which the Board does not recommend such stockholders 
accept.

A transaction shall not constitute a Change in Control if its sole purpose 
is to change the state of the Companys incorporation or to create a 
holding company that will be owned in substantially the same proportions by 
the persons who held the Companys securities immediately before such 
transactions.

(h) Committee means a committee described in Section 3.

means an amount, as specified in the applicable SAR Agreement, which is 
subtracted from the Fair Market Value in determining the amount payable 
upon exercise of such SAR.

(q) Fair Market Value means the market price of a Share as determined in 
good faith by the Committee. Such determination shall be conclusive and 
binding on all persons. The Fair Market Value shall be determined by the 
following:

(i)   If the Shares are admitted to trading on any established national 
stock exchange or market system on the date in question, then the Fair 
Market Value shall be equal to the closing sales price for such Shares as 
quoted on such national exchange or system on such date; or

(ii)  if the Shares are admitted to quotation on any established national 
stock quotation system or are regularly quoted by a recognized securities 
dealer but selling prices are not reported on the date in question, then 
the Fair Market Value shall be equal to the mean between the bid and asked 
prices of the Shares reported for such date.

In each case, the applicable price shall be the price reported in The Wall 
Street Journal or such other source as the Committee deems reliable; 
provided, however, that if there is no such reported price for the Shares 
for the date in question, then the Fair Market Value shall be equal to the 
price reported on the last preceding date for which such price exists. If 
neither (i) or (ii) are applicable, then the Fair Market Value shall be 
determined by the Committee in good faith on such basis as it deems 
appropriate.

(r) Fiscal Year means the Companys fiscal year.

continued service crediting, or when continued service crediting is 
required by applicable law. Service terminates in any event when the 
approved leave ends, unless such Employee immediately returns to active 
work. Further, unless otherwise determined by the Committee, a 
Participants Service will not terminate merely because of a change in the 
capacity in which the Participant provides service to the Company, a

date.

transfer restrictions as the Committee may determine, in its sole 
discretion. Such restrictions shall apply in addition to any restrictions 
that may apply to holders of Shares generally and shall also comply to the

(c) Beneficiaries. Unless stated otherwise in an Award Agreement and then 
only to the extent permitted by applicable law, a Participant may designate 
one or more beneficiaries with respect to an Award by timely filing the 
prescribed form with the Company. A beneficiary designation may be changed 
by filing the prescribed form with the Company at any time before the 
Participants death. If no beneficiary was designated or if no designated 
beneficiary survives the Participant, then after a Participants death any 
vested Award(s) shall be transferred or distributed to the Participants 
estate.

(d) Performance Conditions. The Committee may, in its discretion, include 
performance conditions in an Award.

(e) No Rights as a Stockholder. A Participant, or a transferee of a

terms and conditions to receive such Common Stock, has satisfied any 
applicable withholding or tax obligations relating to the Award and the 
Shares have been issued (as evidenced by an appropriate entry on the books 
of the Company or a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company).

(f) Termination of Service. Unless the applicable Award Agreement provides 
otherwise, the following rules shall govern the vesting, exercisability and 
term of outstanding Awards held by a Participant in the event of 
termination of such Participants Service (in all cases subject to the 
maximum term of the Option and/or SAR as applicable): (i) upon termination 
of Service for any reason, all unvested portions of any outstanding Awards 
shall be immediately forfeited without consideration and the vested 
portions of any outstanding Stock Units shall be settled upon termination; 
(ii) if Service is terminated for Cause, then all unexercised Options 
and/or SARs, unvested portions of Stock Units and unvested portions of 
Stock Grants shall terminate and be forfeited immediately without 
consideration; (iii) if Service is terminated for any reason other than for 
Cause, death or Disability, then the vested portion of his or her 
then-outstanding Options and/or SARs may be exercised by such Participant 
or his or her personal representative within 6 months after the date of 
such termination; or (iv) if Service is terminated due to death or 
Disability, the vested portion of his or her then-outstanding Options 
and/or SARs may be exercised within 12 months after the date of such 
termination.

SECTION 5. SHARES SUBJECT TO PLAN AND SHARE LIMITS.

(a) Basic Limitation. The stock issuable under the Plan shall be authorized 
but unissued Shares or treasury shares. The aggregate number of Shares 
reserved for Awards under the Plan is 750,000 Shares, subject to adjustment

cash, the Shares that would have been delivered had there been no cash 
settlement shall not be counted against the Shares available for issuance 
under the Plan.

(c) Dividend Equivalents. Any dividend equivalents distributed under the 
Plan shall not reduce the number of Shares available for Awards.

(d) Share Limits.

(i)   Limits on Options. No Key Service Provider shall receive Options

adjustment pursuant to Section 10.

pursuant to Section 10.

receive Stock Grants or Stock Units during any Fiscal Year covering, in the 
aggregate, in excess of 250,000 Shares, subject to adjustment pursuant to 
Section 10.

SECTION 6. TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF OPTIONS.

(a) Stock Option Agreement. Each Option granted under the Plan shall be 
evidenced and governed exclusively by a Stock Option Agreement between the 
Optionee and the Company. Such Option shall be subject to all applicable 
terms and conditions of the Plan and may be subject to any other terms and 
conditions that are not inconsistent with the Plan and that the Committee 
deems appropriate for inclusion in a Stock Option Agreement. The provisions 
of the various Stock Option Agreements entered into under the Plan need not 
be identical.

(b) Number of Shares. Each Stock Option Agreement shall specify the number 
of Shares that are subject to the Option, which number is subject to 
adjustment in accordance with Section 10.

(c) Exercise Price. Each Stock Option Agreement shall specify the Options 
Exercise Price which shall be established by the Committee and is subject 
to adjustment in accordance with Section 10. The Exercise Price of an 
Option shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value on the date of 
grant.

(d) Exercisability and Term. Each Stock Option Agreement shall specify the 
date when all or any installment of the Option is to become exercisable and 
may include performance conditions. The Stock Option Agreement shall also 
specify the maximum term of the Option; provided that the maximum term of 
an Option shall in no event exceed 10 years from the date of grant. A Stock 
Option Agreement may provide for
 
 
8
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------


accelerated vesting in the event of the Participants death, Disability or 
other events. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or the Stock 
Option Agreement, no Option can be exercised after the expiration date 
provided in the applicable Stock Option Agreement.

(e) Payment for Option Shares. The Exercise Price of an Option shall be 
paid in cash at the time of exercise, except as follows and if so provided 
for in the applicable Stock Option Agreement:

(i)   Surrender of Stock. Payment of all or any part of the Exercise Price 
may be made with Shares which have already been owned by the Optionee; 
provided that the Committee may, in its sole discretion, require that 
Shares tendered for payment be previously held by the Optionee for a 
minimum duration (e.g., to avoid financial accounting charges to the 
Companys earnings).

(ii)  Cashless Exercise. Payment of all or a part of the Exercise Price may 
be made through Cashless Exercise.

(iii) Other Forms of Payment. Payment may be made in any other form that is 
consistent with applicable laws, regulations and rules and approved by the 
Committee.

(f) Modifications or Assumption of Options. Within the limitations of the 
Plan, the Committee may modify, extend or assume outstanding options or may 
accept the cancellation of outstanding options (whether granted by the 
Company or by another issuer) in return for the grant of new Options for 
the same or a different number of Shares and at the same or a different 
Exercise Price. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence or anything to the 
contrary, no modification of an Option shall, without the consent of the 
Optionee, impair his or her rights or obligations under such Option and, 
unless there is approval by the Company stockholders, the Committee may not 
Re-Price outstanding Options.

(g) Assignment or Transfer of Options. Except as otherwise provided in the 
applicable Stock Option Agreement and then only to the extent such transfer 
is otherwise permitted by applicable law and is not a transfer for value 
(unless such transfer for value is approved in advance by the Companys 
stockholders), no Option shall be transferable by the Optionee other than 
by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. Except as otherwise 
provided in the applicable Stock Option Agreement, an Option may be 
exercised during the lifetime of the Optionee only or by the guardian or 
legal representative of the Optionee. No Option or interest therein may be 
assigned, pledged or hypothecated by the Optionee during his or her 
lifetime, whether by operation of law or otherwise, or be made subject to 
execution, attachment or similar process.

SECTION 7. TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS.

(a) SAR Agreement. Each SAR granted under the Plan shall be evidenced by a 
SAR Agreement between the Participant and the Company. Such SAR shall be 
subject to all
 
 
9
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------


applicable terms of the Plan and may be subject to any other terms that are 
not inconsistent with the Plan. A SAR Agreement may provide for a maximum 
limit on the amount of any payout notwithstanding the Fair Market Value on 
the date of exercise of the SAR. The provisions of the various SAR 
Agreements entered into under the Plan need not be identical. SARs may be 
granted in consideration of a reduction in the Participants compensation.

(b) Number of Shares. Each SAR Agreement shall specify the number of Shares 
to which the SAR pertains, which number is subject to adjustment in 
accordance with Section 10.

(c) Exercise Price. Each SAR Agreement shall specify the Exercise Price, 
which is subject to adjustment in accordance with Section 10. A SAR 
Agreement may specify an Exercise Price that varies in accordance with a 
predetermined formula while the SAR is outstanding. The Exercise Price of a 
SAR shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value on the date of 
grant.

(d) Exercisability and Term. Each SAR Agreement shall specify the date when 
all or any installment of the SAR is to become exercisable and may include 
performance conditions. The SAR Agreement shall also specify the maximum 
term of the SAR which shall not exceed 10 years from the date of grant. A 
SAR Agreement may provide for accelerated exercisability in the event of 
the Participants death, Disability or other events. SARs may be awarded in 
combination with Options or Stock Grants, and such an Award shall provide 
that the SARs will not be exercisable unless the related Options or Stock 
Grants are forfeited. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or 
the SAR Agreement, no SAR can be exercised after the expiration date 
provided in the applicable SAR Agreement.

(e) Exercise of SARs. If, on the date when a SAR expires, the Exercise 
Price under such SAR is less than the Fair Market Value on such date but 
any vested portion of such SAR has not been exercised or surrendered, then 
such SAR shall automatically be deemed to be exercised as of such date with 
respect to such vested portion. Upon exercise of a SAR, the Participant (or 
any person having the right to exercise the SAR after Participants death) 
shall receive from the Company (i) Shares, (ii) cash or (iii) any 
combination of Shares and cash, as the Committee shall determine at the 
time of grant of the SAR, in its sole discretion. The amount of cash and/or 
the Fair Market Value of Shares received upon exercise of SARs shall, in 
the aggregate, be equal to the amount by which the Fair Market Value (on 
the date of surrender) of the Shares subject to the SARs exceeds the 
Exercise Price of the Shares.

(f) Modification or Assumption of SARs. Within the limitations of the Plan, 
the Committee may modify, extend or assume outstanding SARs or may accept 
the cancellation of outstanding stock appreciation rights (including stock 
appreciation rights granted by another issuer) in return for the grant of 
new SARs for the same or a different number of Shares and at the same or a 
different Exercise Price. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence or 
anything to the contrary, no modification of a SAR shall, without the 
consent of the Participant, impair his or her rights or obligations under 
such SAR and, unless there is approval by the Company stockholders, the 
Committee may not Re-Price outstanding SARs.
 
 
10
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------


(g) Assignment or Transfer of SARs. Except as otherwise provided in the 
applicable SAR Agreement and then only to the extent such transfer is 
otherwise permitted by applicable law and is not a transfer for value 
(unless such transfer for value is approved in advance by the Companys 
stockholders), no SAR shall be transferable by the Participant other than 
by will or by the laws of descent and distribution or any similar laws in 
the applicable jurisdiction. Except as otherwise provided in the applicable 
SAR Agreement, a SAR may be exercised during the lifetime of the 
Participant only or by the guardian or legal representative of the 
Participant. No SAR or interest therein may be assigned, pledged or 
hypothecated by the Participant during his or her lifetime, whether by 
operation of law or otherwise, or be made subject to execution, attachment 
or similar process.

SECTION 8. TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR STOCK GRANTS.

(a) Time, Amount and Form of Awards. Awards under this Section 8 may be 
granted in the form of a Stock Grant. A Stock Grant may be awarded in 
combination with Options, and such an Award may provide that the Stock 
Grant will be forfeited in the event that the related Options are 
exercised.

(b) Stock Grant Agreement. Each Stock Grant awarded under the Plan shall be 
evidenced and governed exclusively by a Stock Grant Agreement between the 
Participant and the Company. Each Stock Grant shall be subject to all 
applicable terms and conditions of the Plan and may be subject to any other 
terms and conditions that are not inconsistent with the Plan that the 
Committee deems appropriate for inclusion in the applicable Stock Grant 
Agreement. The provisions of the Stock Grant Agreements entered into under 
the Plan need not be identical.

(c) Payment for Stock Grants. Stock Grants may be issued with or without 
cash consideration under the Plan.

(d) Vesting Conditions. Each Stock Grant may or may not be subject to 
vesting. Vesting shall occur, in full or in installments, upon satisfaction 
of the conditions specified in the Stock Grant Agreement which may include 
performance conditions. A Stock Grant Agreement may provide for accelerated 
vesting in the event of the Participants death, Disability, or other 
events.

(e) Assignment or Transfer of Stock Grants. Except as otherwise provided in 
the applicable Stock Grant Agreement and then only to the extent such 
transfer is otherwise permitted by applicable law and is not a transfer for 
value (unless such transfer for value is approved in advance by the 
Companys stockholders), no unvested Stock Grant shall be transferable 
other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. Except as 
otherwise provided in the applicable Stock Grant Agreement, no unvested 
Stock Grant or interest therein may be anticipated, assigned, attached, 
garnished, optioned, transferred or
 
 
11
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

made subject to any creditors process, whether voluntarily, involuntarily 
or by operation of law. Any act in violation of this Section 8(e) shall be 
void.

(f) Voting and Dividend Rights. The holder of a Stock Grant awarded under 
the Plan shall have the same voting, dividend and other rights as the 
Companys other stockholders. A Stock Grant Agreement, however, may require 
that the holder of such Stock Grant invest any cash dividends received in 
additional Shares subject to the Stock Grant. Such additional Shares and 
any Shares received as a dividend pursuant to the Stock Grant shall be 
subject to the same conditions and restrictions as the Stock Grant with 
respect to which the dividends were paid. Such additional Shares subject to 
the Stock Grant shall not reduce the number of Shares available for 
issuance under Section 5.

(g) Modification or Assumption of Stock Grants. Within the limitations of 
the Plan, the Committee may modify or assume outstanding Stock Grants or 
may accept the cancellation of outstanding stock grants (including stock 
granted by another issuer) in return for the grant of new Stock Grants for 
the same or a different number of Shares. Notwithstanding the preceding 
sentence or anything to the contrary, no modification of a Stock Grant 
shall, without the consent of the Participant, impair his or her rights or 
obligations under such Stock Grant.

SECTION 9. TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF STOCK UNITS.

(a) Stock Unit Agreement. Each Stock Unit granted under the Plan shall be 
evidenced by a Stock Unit Agreement between the Participant and the 
Company. Such Stock Units shall be subject to all applicable terms of the 
Plan and may be subject to any other terms that are not inconsistent with 
the Plan. The provisions of the various Stock Unit Agreements entered into 
under the Plan need not be identical. Stock Units may be granted in 
consideration of a reduction in the Participants other compensation.

(b) Number of Shares. Each Stock Unit Agreement shall specify the number of 
Shares to which the Stock Unit pertains, which number is subject to 
adjustment in accordance with Section 10.

(c) Payment for Awards. To the extent that an Award is granted in the form 
of Stock Units, no cash consideration shall be required of the Award 
recipients.

(d) Vesting Conditions. Each Stock Unit may or may not be subject to 
vesting. Vesting shall occur, in full or in installments, upon satisfaction 
of the conditions specified in the Stock Unit Agreement which may include 
performance conditions. A Stock Unit Agreement may provide for accelerated 
vesting in the event of the Participants death, Disability, or other 
events.

(e) Form and Time of Settlement of Stock Units. Settlement of vested Stock 
Units may be made in the form of (a) cash, (b) Shares or (c) any 
combination of both, as determined by the Committee at the time of the 
grant of the Stock Units, in its sole discretion. Methods of converting 
Stock Units into cash may include (without limitation) a method based on 
the average Fair Market Value of Shares over a series of trading days.
 
 
12
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------


Vested Stock Units may be settled in a lump sum or in installments. The 
distribution may occur or commence when the vesting conditions applicable 
to the Stock Units have been satisfied or have lapsed, or it may be 
deferred, in accordance with applicable law, to any later date. The amount 
of a deferred distribution may be increased by an interest factor or by 
dividend equivalents.

(f) Voting and Dividend Rights. The holders of Stock Units shall have no 
voting rights. Prior to settlement or forfeiture, any Stock Unit awarded 
under the Plan may, at the Committees discretion, carry with it a right to 
dividend equivalents. Such right entitles the holder to be credited with an 
amount equal to all cash dividends paid on one Share while the Stock Unit 
is outstanding. Dividend equivalents may be converted into additional Stock 
Units. Settlement of dividend equivalents may be made in the form of cash, 
in the form of Shares, or in a combination of both. Prior to distribution, 
any dividend equivalents which are not paid shall be subject to the same 
conditions and restrictions as the Stock Units to which they attach.

(g) Creditors Rights. A holder of Stock Units shall have no rights other 
than those of a general creditor of the Company. Stock Units represent an 
unfunded and unsecured obligation of the Company, subject to the terms and 
conditions of the applicable Stock Unit Agreement.

(h) Modification or Assumption of Stock Units. Within the limitations of 
the Plan, the Committee may modify or assume outstanding Stock Units or may 
accept the cancellation of outstanding stock units (including stock units 
granted by another issuer) in return for the grant of new Stock Units for 
the same or a different number of Shares. Notwithstanding the preceding 
sentence or anything to the contrary, no modification of a Stock Unit 
shall, without the consent of the Participant, impair his or her rights or 
obligations under such Stock Unit.

(i) Assignment or Transfer of Stock Units. Except as provided in the 
applicable Stock Unit Agreement and then only to the extent such transfer 
is otherwise permitted by applicable law and is not a transfer for value 
(unless such transfer for value is approved in advance by the Companys 
stockholders), Stock Units shall not be transferable other than by will or 
by the laws of descent and distribution. Except as otherwise provided in 
the applicable Stock Unit Agreement, no Stock Unit or interest therein may 
be anticipated, assigned, attached, garnished, optioned, transferred or 
made subject to any creditors process, whether voluntarily, involuntarily 
or by operation of law. Any act in violation of this Section 9(i) shall be 
void.

SECTION 10. PROTECTION AGAINST DILUTION.

(a) Adjustments. In the event of a subdivision of the outstanding Shares, a 
declaration of a dividend payable in Shares, a declaration of a dividend 
payable in a form other than Shares in an amount that has a material effect 
on the price of Shares, a combination or consolidation of the outstanding 
Shares (by reclassification or otherwise) into a lesser number of Shares, a 
recapitalization, a spin-off or a similar occurrence, the Committee shall 
make such adjustments as it, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate in 
one or more of:
 
 
13
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------


(i)    the number of Shares and the kind of shares or securities available 
for future Awards under Section 5;

(ii)   the limits on Awards specified in Section 5;

(iii)  the number of Shares and the kind of shares or securities covered by 
each outstanding Award; or

(iv) the Exercise Price under each outstanding SAR or Option.

(b) Participant Rights. Except as provided in this Section 10, a 
Participant shall have no rights by reason of any issue by the Company of 
stock of any class or securities convertible into stock of any class, any 
subdivision or consolidation of shares of stock of any class, the payment 
of any stock dividend or any other increase or decrease in the number of 
shares of stock of any class. If by reason of an adjustment pursuant to 
this Section 10 a Participants Award covers additional or different shares 
of stock or securities, then such additional or different shares and the 
Award in respect thereof shall be subject to all of the terms, conditions 
and restrictions which were applicable to the Award and the Shares subject 
to the Award prior to such adjustment.

(c) Fractional Shares. Any adjustment of Shares pursuant to this Section 10 
shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number of Shares. Under no 
circumstances shall the Company be required to authorize or issue 
fractional shares and no consideration shall be provided as a result of any 
fractional shares not being issued or authorized.

SECTION 11. EFFECT OF A CHANGE IN CONTROL.

(a) Change in Control. In the event that the Company is a party to a Change 
in Control, outstanding Awards shall be subject to the applicable agreement 
of merger or reorganization. Such agreement may provide, without 
limitation, for the assumption of outstanding Awards by the surviving 
corporation or its parent, for their continuation by the Company (if the 
Company is a surviving corporation), for accelerated vesting or for their 
cancellation with or without consideration, in all cases without the 
consent of the Participant.

(b) Acceleration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may 
determine, at the time of grant of an Award or thereafter, that such Award 
shall become vested and exercisable, in full or in part, in the event that 
the Company is a party to a Change in Control.

(c) Dissolution. To the extent not previously exercised or settled, 
Options, SARs and Stock Units shall terminate immediately prior to the 
dissolution or liquidation of the Company.
 
 
14
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------


SECTION 12. LIMITATIONS ON RIGHTS.

(a) Participant Rights. A Participants rights, if any, in respect of or in 
connection with any Award is derived solely from the discretionary decision 
of the Company to permit the individual to participate in the Plan and to 
benefit from a discretionary Award. By accepting an Award under the Plan, a 
Participant expressly acknowledges that there is no obligation on the part 
of the Company to continue the Plan and/or grant any additional Awards. Any 
Award granted hereunder is not intended to be compensation of a continuing 
or recurring nature, or part of a Participants normal or expected 
compensation, and in no way represents any portion of a Participants 
salary, compensation, or other remuneration for purposes of pension 
benefits, severance, redundancy, resignation or any other purpose.

Neither the Plan nor any Award granted under the Plan shall be deemed to 
give any individual a right to remain an employee, consultant or director 
of the Company, a Parent, a Subsidiary or an Affiliate. The Company and its 
Parent, Subsidiaries and Affiliates reserve the right to terminate the 
Service of any person at any time, and for any reason, subject to 
applicable laws, the Companys Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws and any 
applicable written employment agreement (if any), and such terminated 
person shall be deemed irrevocably to have waived any claim to damages or 
specific performance for breach of contract or dismissal, compensation for 
loss of office, tort or otherwise with respect to the Plan or any 
outstanding Award that is forfeited and/or is terminated by its terms or to 
any future Award.

(b) Stockholders Rights. Except as provided in Section 9(f), a Participant 
shall have no dividend rights, voting rights or other rights as a 
stockholder with respect to any Shares covered by his or her Award prior to 
the issuance of such Shares (as evidenced by an appropriate entry on the 
books of the Company or a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company). 
No adjustment shall be made for cash dividends or other rights for which 
the record date is prior to the date when such Shares are issued, except as 
expressly provided in Sections 9(f) and 10.

(c) Regulatory Requirements. Any other provision of the Plan 
notwithstanding, the obligation of the Company to issue Shares or other 
securities under the Plan shall be subject to all applicable laws, rules 
and regulations and such approval by any regulatory body as may be 
required. The Company reserves the right to restrict, in whole or in part, 
the delivery of Shares or other securities pursuant to any Award prior to 
the satisfaction of all legal requirements relating to the issuance of such 
Shares or other securities, to their registration, qualification or listing 
or to an exemption from registration, qualification or listing.

SECTION 13. TAXES.

(a) General. A Participant shall make arrangements satisfactory to the 
Company for the satisfaction of any withholding or tax obligations that 
arise in connection with his or her Award. The Company shall not be 
required to issue any Shares or make any cash payment under the Plan until 
such obligations are satisfied.
 
 
15
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------


(b) Share Withholding. The Committee may permit a Participant to satisfy 
all or part of his or her withholding or tax obligations by Cashless 
Exercise, by having the Company withhold all or a portion of any Shares 
that otherwise would be issued to him or her or by surrendering all or a 
portion of any Shares that he or she previously acquired (the Company may, 
in its discretion, require that Shares withheld or previously owned Shares 
that are tendered shall not exceed the amount necessary to satisfy the 
Companys tax withholding obligations at the minimum statutory withholding 
rates unless the previously owned Shares have been held for the minimum 
duration necessary to avoid financial accounting charges under applicable 
accounting guidance). Any payment of taxes by assigning Shares to the 
Company may be subject to restrictions, including, but not limited to, any 
restrictions required by rules of the SEC.

SECTION 14. DURATION AND AMENDMENTS.

(a) Term of the Plan. The Plan shall become effective upon its approval by 
the Companys stockholders. The Plan shall terminate on October 30, 2017 
and may be terminated on any earlier date pursuant to this Section 14.

(b) Right to Amend or Terminate the Plan. The Board may amend or terminate 
the Plan at any time and for any reason. Any such termination of the Plan, 
or any amendment thereof, shall not impair any Award previously granted 
under the Plan. No Awards shall be granted under the Plan after the Plans 
termination. An amendment of the Plan shall be subject to the approval of 
the Companys stockholders only to the extent such approval is required by 
applicable laws, regulations or rules.
