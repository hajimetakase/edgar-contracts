Subject: Letter from Techsphere to Identicas auditors

Date: August 13, 2007


TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:


I have been advised that you quite properly require comment on your 
financial reporting requirements as to the possibility of terminating the 
product distribution agreement we currently have with Identica Holdings 
Corporation, based upon the possibility that Identica may not meet its 
product sales quotas.

Please be advised that we are in negotiation with Identica at this time and 
intend to eliminate the product sales quota clause in favor of a five-year 
cumulative revenue stream concept that will replace the quota system.

Based upon our renegotiations I can categorically assert with the knowledge 
that you intend to rely upon my statement for your financial reporting 
requirements, that Identicas existing Distribution Agreement as modified, 
will not be subject to termination by Techsphere on the basis of Identicas 
theoretical or possible inability to meet sales quotas and further, that we 
have every expectation that the five-year revenue stream concept will not 
be burdensome nor an issue for Identica over the next three-year period at 
minimum.


Yours truly,

Alex Choi

CEO/President, Techsphere Co., Ltd.
