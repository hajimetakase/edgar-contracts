AGREEMENT THIS AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AND SECURITY AGREEMENT, dated as 
of November 7, 2007 is entered into by and among: (a) BOSTON SCIENTIFIC 
FUNDING LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("Borrower"), (b) BOSTON 
SCIENTIFIC CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation ("BSX"), as initial 
Servicer, (c) OLD LINE FUNDING, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company 
(together with its successors, "Old Line"), ROYAL BANK OF CANADA, a 
Canadian chartered bank acting through a New York branch, in its capacity 
as a Liquidity Bank to Old Line (together with its successors in such 
capacity, "RBC" and together with Old Line, the "Old Line Group"), (d) 
VICTORY RECEIVABLES CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (together with its 
successors, "Victory" and, together with Old Line, the "Conduits"), and THE 
BANK OF TOKYO-MITSUBISHI UFJ, LTD., NEW YORK BRANCH, in its capacity as a 
Liquidity Bank to Victory (together with its successors, "BTMU" and, 
together with Victory, the "Victory Group"), (e) ROYAL BANK OF CANADA, a 
Canadian chartered bank acting through a New York branch, in its capacity 
as agent for the Old Line Group (together with its successors in such 
capacity, the "Old Line Agent" or a "Co-Agent"), and THE BANK OF 
TOKYO-MITSUBISHI UFJ, LTD., NEW YORK BRANCH, in its capacity as agent for 
the Victory Group (together with its successors in such capacity, the 
"Victory Agent" or a "Co-Agent"), and (f) ROYAL BANK OF CANADA, a Canadian 
chartered bank acting through a New York branch, in its capacity as 
administrative agent for the Old Line Group, the Victory Group and the 
Co-Agents (in such capacity, together with any successors thereto in such 
capacity, the "Administrative Agent" and together with each of the 
Co-Agents, the "Agents"). Unless defined elsewhere herein, capitalized 
terms used in this Agreement and not defined herein shall have the meanings 
assigned to such terms in Exhibit I. Those capitalized terms used herein 
but defined in other Transaction Documents shall have the same meanings 
assigned to such terms in those other Transaction Documents when used 
herein unless otherwise defined herein. PRELIMINARY STATEMENTS The parties 
hereto are parties (in the case of Old Line and RBC, by way of assignment 
and assumption) to a Credit and Security Agreement dated as of August 16, 
2002 and previously amended (the "Original Agreement"). The parties hereto 
desire to further amend and restate the Original Agreement as of the date 
hereof. Now, therefore, the parties hereto agree as follows: ARTICLE I THE 
CREDIT Section 1.1 The Facility. On the terms and subject to the conditions 
set forth in this Agreement, Borrower (or the Servicer on Borrower's 
behalf) may from time to time during the Revolving Period request Advances 
by delivering a Borrowing Request to the Co-Agents in accordance with 
Section 2.1. Upon receipt of a copy of each Borrowing Request from Borrower 
or Servicer, each of the Co-Agents shall determine whether its Conduit will 
make a Loan in an amount equal to its Group's Percentage of the requested 
Advance specified in such Borrowing Request, and (a) in the event that Old 
Line elects not to make any such Loan to Borrower, the Old Line Agent shall 
promptly notify Borrower and, unless Borrower cancels its Borrowing 
Request, each of the Old Line Liquidity Banks severally agrees to make its 
Ratable Share of such Loan to Borrower, on the terms and subject to the 
conditions hereof, provided that at no time may the aggregate principal 
amount of Old Line's and the Old Line Liquidity Banks' Loans at any one 
time outstanding exceed the lesser of (i) the aggregate amount of the Old 
Line Liquidity Banks' Commitments, and (ii) the Old Line Group's Percentage 
of the Borrowing Base (such lesser amount, the "Old Line Allocation 
Limit"); and (b) in the event that Victory fails to make any such Loan to 
Borrower pursuant to Victory's Commitment, the Victory Agent shall promptly 
notify Borrower and, unless Borrower cancels its Borrowing Request, each of 
the Victory Liquidity Banks severally agrees to make its Ratable Share of 
such Loan to Borrower, on the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, 
provided that at no time may the aggregate principal amount of Victory's 
and the Victory Liquidity Banks' Loans at any one time outstanding exceed 
the lesser of (i) the aggregate amount of the Victory Group's Commitments, 
and (ii) the Victory Group's Percentage of the Borrowing Base (such lesser 
amount, the "Victory Allocation Limit"). Each Loan shall be in the minimum 
amount of $1,000,000 or a larger integral multiple of $500,000. In no event 
may the aggregate principal amount of the Advances hereunder exceed the 
lesser of (x) the Aggregate Commitment, or (y) the Borrowing Base. Each 
Committed Lender's Commitment under this Agreement shall terminate on the 
Facility Termination Date. Each of the Loans, and all other Obligations of 
Borrower, shall be secured by the Collateral as provided in Article XIII. 
Section 1.2 Funding Mechanics; Liquidity Fundings. (a) Each Advance 
hereunder shall consist of Loans made by each Group and (except for any 
Advance which does not increase the aggregate principal amount of the Loans 
outstanding) shall be made in such proportions by each Group such that, 
after giving effect thereto, the aggregate outstanding principal balance of 
the Loans outstanding from each Group shall be in proportion to such 
Group's Percentage of the aggregate outstanding principal balance 2 of all 
Advances then outstanding hereunder. Any Advance which does not increase 
the aggregate principal amount outstanding may be funded solely by one or 
more of the members of a single Group. (b) Each Lender funding any portion 
of an Advance shall wire transfer the principal amount of its Loan to its 
applicable Co-Agent in immediately available funds not later than 1:00 p.m. 
(New York City time) on the applicable Borrowing Date and, subject to its 
receipt of such Loan proceeds, such Co-Agent shall wire transfer such funds 
to the account specified by Borrower in its Borrowing Request not later 
than 2:00 p.m. (New York City time) on such Borrowing Date. (c) While it is 
the intent of each of the Conduits to fund its respective Loans through the 
issuance of Commercial Paper, the parties acknowledge that if any Conduit 
is unable, or determines in its reasonable business judgment that it is 
undesirable for any reason to issue Commercial Paper to fund or maintain 
all or any portion of its Loans at a CP Rate, or is unable to repay such 
Commercial Paper upon the maturity thereof, such Conduit or its related 
Liquidity Bank will fund such Loan, or a portion thereof, as a Liquidity 
Funding. The Liquidity Fundings may be Alternate Base Rate Loans or LIBOR 
Loans, or a combination thereof; provided, however, that each Liquidity 
Funding shall be an Alternate Base Rate Loan at least for the first two (2) 
Business Days after it is funded. In addition, the parties acknowledge that 
Commercial Paper is issued at a discount and at varying discount rates; 
accordingly, it may not be possible for all CP Rate Loans to be made in 
amounts precisely equal to the amounts specified in a Borrowing Request. 
Regardless of whether a Liquidity Funding constitutes an assignment of a 
Loan or the sale of one or more participations therein or any other 
obtaining of funding for all or any portion of any Loan, each Liquidity 
Bank participating in a Liquidity Funding shall have the same rights as its 
Conduit has hereunder with the same force and effect as if such Liquidity 
Bank had directly made a Loan to Borrower in the amount of its Liquidity 
Funding. (d) Nothing herein shall be deemed to commit any Lender to make CP 
Rate Loans. Section 1.3 Interest Rates. (a) Each CP Rate Loan shall bear 
interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from and including the 
first day of each CP Tranche Period to (and including) the last day of such 
CP Tranche Period at the applicable CP Rate. On the 5th Business Day 
immediately preceding each Settlement Date, each Co-Agent shall calculate 
the amount of CP Costs for its Conduit for the applicable CP Tranche Period 
and each shall notify Borrower of such amount which shall be payable on 
such Settlement Date. (b) Each LIBOR Loan shall bear interest on the 
outstanding principal amount thereof from and including the first day of 
the Interest Period applicable thereto to (but not including) the last day 
of such Interest Period at a rate per annum equal to the applicable LIBOR 
for such LIBOR Loan and such Interest Period; provided that (i) the 
applicable Co-Agent has received the notice as and when required under 
Section 2.2(b) and (ii) the applicable Co-Agent determines that (I) the 
funding of a LIBOR Loan would not violate any applicable law and (II) 
deposits of a type and maturity appropriate to match-fund such LIBOR Loan 
are available. 3 (c) Each Alternate Base Rate Loan shall bear interest on 
the outstanding principal amount thereof, for each day from and including 
the date such Loan is made to but excluding the date it is paid at a rate 
per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate for such Alternate Base Rate 
Loan for such day. Changes in the rate of interest on Alternate Base Rate 
Loans will take effect simultaneously with each change in the Alternate 
Base Rate. (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in 
Sections 1.3(a), (b) or (c), upon the occurrence of an Amortization Event, 
and during the continuance thereof, all Obligations shall bear interest, 
payable upon demand, at the Default Rate. (e) Interest shall be payable for 
the day a Loan is made but not for the day of any payment on the amount 
paid if payment is received by each Co-Agent prior to 1:00 p.m. (New York 
City time) at the place of payment. If any payment of principal of or 
interest on a Loan shall become due on a day which is not a Business Day, 
such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and, in the 
case of a principal payment, such extension of time shall be included in 
computing interest in connection with such payment. Section 1.4 Payment 
Dates; Absence of Notes to Evidence Loans. (a) Borrower promises to pay the 
principal of each CP Rate Loan on the last day of its CP Tranche Period. 
(b) Borrower promises to pay the principal of each LIBOR Loan on the last 
day of its Interest Period. (c) Borrower promises to pay the principal of 
each Alternate Base Rate Loan on or before the earlier to occur of (i) the 
Facility Termination Date, and (ii) the refinancing of such Loan with a CP 
Rate Loan or a LIBOR Loan. (d) Borrower promises to pay all accrued and 
unpaid interest on each Loan for each Settlement Period or CP Tranche 
Period on its applicable Settlement Date(s). (e) Each Lender shall maintain 
(or cause its respective Co-Agent to maintain) in accordance with its usual 
practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of Borrower to 
such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender from time to time, 
including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such 
Lender from time to time hereunder. Upon request of Borrower, such Lender's 
Co-Agent or the Administrative Agent, such Lender will confirm the 
outstanding principal balances of its Loans and the amount of any accrued 
and unpaid interest thereon. The entries maintained in the accounts 
maintained pursuant to this Section shall absent manifest error be correct 
evidence of the existence and amounts of the Obligations therein recorded; 
provided, however, that the failure of any Lender (or Co-Agent) to maintain 
such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the 
obligation of Borrower to repay the Obligations in accordance with their 
terms. Section 1.5 Prepayments. Subject, in the case of CP Rate Loans and 
LIBOR Loans, to the funding indemnification provisions of Section 4.3: 4 
(a) Borrower may from time to time voluntarily prepay, without penalty or 
premium, all outstanding Advances, or, in a minimum aggregate amount of 
$2,000,000 (or a larger integral multiple of $1,000,000), any portion of 
the outstanding Advances by giving prior irrevocable written notice to the 
Co-Agents (each, a "Prepayment Notice"): (i) given within the Required 
Notice Period and (ii) providing for, in the case of LIBOR Loans, such 
prepayment to occur on the last day of the Interest Period for any 
Liquidity Bank's LIBOR Loans so prepaid; provided that each such prepayment 
of principal complying with the provisions of this section or otherwise is 
accompanied by a payment of all accrued and unpaid interest on the amount 
prepaid, together with all amounts (if any) due under Section 4.3 and any 
Broken Funding Costs (if any) due because of such prepayment, and is made 
between the Conduits in such proportions so that after giving effect 
thereto, the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the Loans 
outstanding from each Conduit shall be in proportion to such Conduit's 
percentage of the aggregate outstanding principal balance of all Advances 
then outstanding hereunder. (b) If, on any Business Day, the aggregate 
outstanding principal amount of the Loans from the Old Line Group exceeds 
the Old Line Allocation Limit, or the aggregate principal amount of the 
Loans outstanding from the Old Line Group exceeds the Old Line Liquidity 
Banks' Liquidity Commitments pursuant to the Old Line Liquidity Agreement 
divided by 102%, Borrower shall prepay such Loans by wire transfer to the 
Old Line Agent received not later than 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) on 
the first Business Day thereafter of an amount sufficient to eliminate such 
excess, together with accrued and unpaid interest on the amount prepaid. 
(c) If, on any Business Day, the aggregate outstanding principal amount of 
the Loans from the Victory Group exceeds the Victory Allocation Limit, or 
the aggregate principal amount of the Loans outstanding from the Victory 
Group exceeds the Victory Liquidity Banks' aggregate Liquidity Commitments 
pursuant to the Victory Liquidity Agreement divided by 102%, Borrower shall 
prepay such Loans by wire transfer to the Victory Agent received not later 
than 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the first Business Day thereafter of 
an amount sufficient to eliminate such excess, together with accrued and 
unpaid interest on the amount prepaid. (d) Upon receipt of any wire 
transfer pursuant to Section 1.5(a), (b) or (c), the applicable Co-Agent 
shall wire transfer to each of its Constituent Lenders their respective 
shares thereof not later than 1:30 p.m. (New York City time) on the date 
when received. Any prepayment required pursuant to Section 1.5 (b) or (c) 
shall be applied in such order as each Co-Agent may determine. Section 1.6 
Changes in Aggregate Commitment. (a) Borrower may reduce the Aggregate 
Commitment in whole, or ratably between the Groups in part, in a minimum 
amount of $10,000,000 (or a larger integral multiple of $1,000,000), upon 
at least five (5) Business Days' written notice to the Co-Agents in the 
form of Exhibit VII-l hereto (each, a "Commitment Reduction Notice"), which 
notice shall specify the aggregate amount of any such reduction and the 
Liquidity Banks' respective amounts thereof, provided, however, that (a) 
the amount of the Aggregate Commitment may not be reduced below the 
Aggregate Principal unless accompanied by a prepayment pursuant to Section 
1.5 in the amount necessary to ensure that the Aggregate Principal does not 
exceed the Aggregate Commitment, and (b) the amount of the Aggregate 
Commitment may not be reduced below $100,000,000 unless the Aggregate 5 
Commitment is terminated in full. All accrued and unpaid fees, including 
Broken Funding Costs, if any, shall be payable on the effective date of any 
termination of the Aggregate Commitment. Each Commitment Reduction Notice 
shall be irrevocable once delivered to the Co-Agents. (b) At any time prior 
to the Facility Termination Date, Borrower may request an increase in the 
Aggregate Commitment ratably between the Groups (except as provided in the 
last sentence of this Section 1.6 (b)), in a minimum amount of $10,000,000 
(or a larger integral multiple of $1,000,000), upon at least fifteen (15) 
Business Days' written notice to the Co-Agents in the form of Exhibit VII-2 
hereto (each, a "Commitment Increase Request"), which request shall specify 
the aggregate amount of any such increase and the Liquidity Banks' proposed 
respective amounts thereof. On or within fifteen (15) Business Days after 
its receipt of a Commitment Increase Request, each of the Co-Agents shall 
notify Borrower in writing in the form of Exhibit VII-3 hereto (each, a 
"Commitment Increase Response") as to whether the Liquidity Banks in its 
Group, in their sole and absolute discretion, will agree to such Group's 
requested increase in whole or in part. Failure by any Co-Agent to issue a 
Commitment Increase Response within such fifteen (15) Business Day period 
shall be deemed to constitute a denial by such Co-Agent's Group. If any of 
the Co-Agents issues a Commitment Increase Response that is affirmative, in 
whole or in part, the agreed portion of the increase requested from its 
Group will become effective on the fifteenth (15th) Business Day after the 
date of the applicable Commitment Increase Request. If any of the Co-Agents 
issues a Commitment Increase Response that is negative, in whole or in 
part, or fails to issue a timely Commitment Increase Response, Borrower may 
request each other Co-Agent's Group to agree to the declined portion of 
such increase by issuing another Commitment Increase Request pursuant to 
this Section 1.6 (b). Section 1.7 Distribution of Certain Notices; 
Notification of Interest Rates. Promptly after receipt thereof, each 
Co-Agent will notify its Constituent Lenders of the contents of each 
Monthly Report, Borrowing Request, Commitment Reduction Notice, Prepayment 
Notice, or notice of default received by it from Borrower or the Servicer 
hereunder. In addition, each of the Co-Agents shall promptly notify its 
Constituent Lenders and Borrower of each determination of and change in 
Interest Rates and of any decision by the Liquidity Banks in its Group not 
to extend their Liquidity Termination Date. Section 1.8 Extension of the 
Scheduled Termination Date. (a) Provided that no Unmatured Amortization 
Event or Amortization Event exists and is continuing, the Borrower may 
request one or more Liquidity Bank(s) to extend its Scheduled Termination 
Date by submitting a request for an extension (each, an "Extension 
Request") to the Co-Agents no more than 90 days prior to each such 
Liquidity Bank's respective Scheduled Termination Date then in effect. Each 
Extension Request must specify the new Scheduled Termination Date requested 
by the Borrower for such Liquidity Bank(s) and the date (which must be at 
least 30 days after the Extension Request is delivered to the Co-Agents) as 
of which the Co-Agents and the applicable Liquidity Bank(s) must respond to 
the Extension Request (the "Response Date"). The new Scheduled Termination 
Date for each applicable Liquidity Bank shall be no more than 364 days 
after the applicable Response Date, including such Response Date as one of 
the days in the calculation of the days elapsed. 6 (b) Promptly upon 
receipt of an Extension Request, each Co-Agent shall notify its Constituent 
Lenders of the contents thereof and shall request each applicable Liquidity 
Bank to approve such Extension Request. Each applicable Liquidity Bank 
approving such Extension Request shall deliver its written approval to its 
Co-Agent no later than the Response Date, whereupon such Co-Agent shall 
notify the other Co-Agent(s) and the Borrower within one Business Day 
thereafter as to which (if any) of such Co-Agent's applicable Constituent 
Liquidity Banks have approved such Extension Request. (c) If any applicable 
Liquidity Bank does not approve the Extension Request (each such 
non-approving Liquidity Bank, a "Non-Approving Lender") its Co-Agent shall 
promptly notify its Conduit, the other Co-Agent(s) and the Borrower of such 
fact, and the Borrower shall have the right to (i) require such 
Non-Approving Lender to assign all, but not less than all, of its 
Commitment and outstanding Obligations by entering into written assignments 
with one or more Eligible Assignees not later than the 5th Business Day 
prior to such Non-Approving Lender's existing Scheduled Termination Date, 
or (ii) to pay in full of all Obligations (if any) owing to such 
Non-Approving Lender and terminate its Commitment no later than such 
Non-Approving Lender's existing Scheduled Termination Date. Each assignment 
pursuant to clause (i) above to an Eligible Assignee (which may include a 
Constituent of another Co-Agent) shall become effective on the existing 
Scheduled Termination Date and, subject to receipt of payment in full on 
such existing Scheduled Termination Date for all Obligations, if any, owing 
to such Non-Approving Lender, such Non-Approving Lender shall make each 
such requested assignment; provided that any expenses or other amounts 
which would be owing to such Non-Approving Lender pursuant to any 
indemnification provision hereof shall be payable by the Borrower as if the 
Borrower had prepaid the Loans of the assigning Lenders rather than such 
assigning Lenders having assigned their respective interests hereunder. If 
no assignment of a Non-Approving Lender's Commitment to an Eligible 
Assignee is executed by the 5th Business Day prior to its existing 
Scheduled Termination Date, the Scheduled Termination Date for all Lenders 
shall remain unchanged. If all applicable Liquidity Banks approve an 
Extension Request by the Response Date, the Scheduled Termination Date 
specified in such Extension Request shall become effective on such Response 
Date as to the approving Liquidity Banks, and each of the Co-Agents shall 
promptly notify the Borrower and the other Co-Agent(s) of the applicable 
Liquidity Banks' new Scheduled Termination Date. Section 1.9 Eligible 
Originators. A list of Eligible Originators as of the Initial Closing Date 
is attached hereto as Exhibit X. After the Initial Closing Date, BSX may 
request that additional Eligible Originators be designated by submitting a 
written request to the Co-Agents. If the Co-Agents, in their sole 
discretion, approve any such request in writing within 30 days after 
receiving such request, Exhibit X will be automatically deemed amended to 
add the name of such newly approved Eligible Originator. If the Co-Agents 
have not approved such request in writing within thirty (30) days (or if 
any Co-Agent notifies BSX and the other Co-Agent that such request is not 
approved), such request shall be considered to have been denied. ARTICLE II 
BORROWING AND PAYMENT MECHANICS; CERTAIN COMPUTATIONS Section 2.1 Request a 
Borrowing. Borrower (or the Servicer, on Borrower's behalf) shall give the 
Co-Agents irrevocable notice in the form of Exhibit II hereto (each, a 
"Borrowing 7 Request") not later than 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) at 
least two (2) Business Days before the Borrowing Date of each Advance. On 
each Borrowing Date, each applicable Lender shall make available its Loan 
or Loans in accordance with Section 1.2(b). Unless each of the Co-Agents in 
its sole discretion shall otherwise agree, not more than one (1) Borrowing 
Date shall occur in any calendar week. Section 2.2 CP Tranche Periods and 
Interest Periods. (a) Unless a Co-Agent shall have received written notice 
by 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the second (2nd) Business Day prior to 
the last day of a CP Tranche Period that Borrower intends to reduce the 
aggregate principal amount of the CP Rate Loans outstanding, such Co-Agent 
and its related Conduit shall be entitled to assume that Borrower desires 
to refinance the principal and interest of each maturing CP Rate Loan on 
the last day of its CP Tranche Period with new CP Rate Loans; provided, 
however, that Borrower shall remain liable to pay in cash any portion of 
the principal or interest on the maturing CP Rate Loan when due to the 
extent that the applicable Conduit cannot issue Commercial Paper or avail 
itself of a Liquidity Funding, in either case, in the precise amount 
necessary to refinance the maturing CP Rate Loan and the accrued and unpaid 
interest thereon. (b) Unless a Co-Agent shall have received written notice 
by 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the second (2nd) Business Day prior to 
the last day of an Interest Period with respect to a LIBOR Loan that 
Borrower intends to reduce the aggregate principal amount of LIBOR Loans 
outstanding, such Co-Agent and its related Liquidity Banks shall be 
entitled to assume that Borrower desires to refinance its maturing LIBOR 
Loans on the last day of such Interest Period with Alternate Base Rate 
Loans. Section 2.3 Computation of Concentration Limits and Outstanding 
Balance. The Obligor Concentration Limits and the aggregate Outstanding 
Balance of Receivables of each Obligor and its Affiliates who are Obligors 
(if any) shall be calculated as if each such Obligor and its Affiliates who 
are Obligors were one Obligor. Section 2.4 Maximum Interest Rate. No 
provision of this Agreement shall require the payment or permit the 
collection of interest in excess of the maximum permitted by applicable law 
(the "Maximum Rate"). If at any time the interest rate applicable to any 
Loan, together with all fees, charges and other amounts which are treated 
as interest on such Loan under applicable law (collectively the "Charges"), 
shall exceed the Maximum Rate which may be contracted for, charged, taken, 
received or reserved by the Lender holding such Loan in accordance with 
applicable law, the rate of interest payable in respect of such Loan 
hereunder, together with all Charges payable in respect thereof, shall be 
limited to the Maximum Rate and, to the extent lawful, the interest and 
Charges that would have been payable in respect of such Loan but were not 
payable as a result of the operation of this Section shall be cumulated and 
the interest and Charges payable to such Lender in respect of other Loans 
or periods shall be increased (but not above the Maximum Rate therefor) 
until such cumulated amount, together with interest thereon at the Federal 
Funds Effective Rate to the date of repayment, shall have been received by 
such Lender. Section 2.5 Payments and Computations, Etc. 8 (a) Payments. 
All amounts to be paid or deposited by Borrower or the Servicer (on 
Borrower's behalf) to any of the Agents or Lenders (other than amounts 
payable under Section 4.2) shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately 
available funds received not later than 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) on 
the day when due in lawful money of the United States of America to the 
applicable Co-Agent at its address specified below its signature hereto, 
and, to the extent such payment is for the account of any Lender, the 
applicable Co-Agent shall promptly disburse such funds to the appropriate 
Lender(s) in its Group. (b) Late Payments. Upon demand, Borrower or the 
Servicer (on Borrower's behalf), as applicable, shall pay to the applicable 
Co-Agent for the account of each Person in its Group to whom payment of any 
Obligation is due, interest on all amounts not paid or deposited by 1:00 
p.m. (New York City time) on the date when due (without taking into account 
any applicable grace period) at the Default Rate. (c) Method of 
Computation. All computations of interest at the Alternate Base Rate or the 
Default Rate shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 (or, when 
appropriate, 366) days for the actual number of days (including the first 
day but excluding the last day) elapsed. All other computations of 
interest, and all computations of Servicing Fee, any per annum fees payable 
under Section 4.1 and any other per annum fees payable by Borrower to the 
Lenders, the Servicer or any of the Agents under the Transaction Documents 
shall be made on the basis of a year of 360 days for the actual number of 
days (including the first day but excluding the last day) elapsed. (d) 
Avoidance or Rescission of Payments. No payment of any Obligation shall be 
considered to have been paid if at any time such payment is rescinded or 
must be returned for any reason. Section 2.6 Non-Receipt of Funds by the Co 
Agents. Unless a Lender notifies its Co-Agent prior to the date and time on 
which it is scheduled to fund a Loan that it does not intend to fund, such 
Co-Agent may assume that such funding will be made and may, but shall not 
be obligated to, make the amount of such Loan available to the intended 
recipient in reliance upon such assumption. If such Lender has not in fact 
funded its Loan proceeds to the applicable Co-Agent, the recipient of such 
payment shall, on demand by such Co-Agent, repay to such Co-Agent the 
amount so made available together with interest thereon in respect of each 
day during the period commencing on the date such amount was so made 
available by such Co-Agent until the date such Co-Agent recovers such 
amount at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Effective Rate for 
such day. ARTICLE III SETTLEMENTS Section 3.1 Monthly Reporting. Not later 
than the Monthly Reporting Date in each calendar month hereafter, the 
Servicer shall deliver to each of the Co-Agents, a Monthly Report 
accompanied by an electronic file in a form reasonably satisfactory to each 
of the Co-Agents. At or before 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth 
Business Day immediately preceding each Settlement Date, each of the 
Co-Agents shall notify Borrower and the Servicer of (i) the aggregate 
principal balance of all Loans that are then outstanding from its 
Constituents, and (ii) 9 the aggregate amount of all principal, interest 
and fees that will be due and payable by Borrower to such Co-Agent for the 
account of such Co-Agent or its Constituents on such Settlement Date. 
Section 3.2 Turnover of Collections. Without limiting any Agent's or 
Lender's recourse to Borrower for payment of any and all Obligations: (a) 
If any Monthly Report reveals that a mandatory prepayment is required under 
Section 1.5(b) or (c), not later than the 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) on 
the next succeeding Settlement Date, the Servicer shall turn over to each 
applicable Co-Agent, for distribution to its Constituents, a portion of the 
Collections received as of the Monthly Reporting Date on which such Monthly 
Report was due and not previously so distributed equal to the amount of 
such required mandatory prepayment; (b) If, on any Settlement Date, any 
Loans are to be voluntarily prepaid in accordance with Section 1.5(a), or 
if the aggregate principal amount of the Advances outstanding is to be 
reduced, the Servicer shall turn over to each of the Co-Agents, for 
distribution to its Constituents, a portion of the Collections equal to the 
Groups' respective Percentages of the aggregate amount of such voluntary 
prepayment or reduction and any other amounts required to be paid in 
connection with such voluntary prepayment or reduction; and (c) In addition 
to, but without duplication of, the foregoing, on (i) each Settlement Date 
and (ii) each other date on which any principal of or interest on any of 
the Loans becomes due (whether by acceleration or otherwise) and, in the 
case of principal, has not been reborrowed pursuant to Section 1.1, the 
Servicer shall turn over to each of the Co-Agents, for distribution to 
their respective Constituents, the Groups' respective Percentages of a 
portion of the Collections equal to the aggregate amount of all other 
Obligations that are due and owing on such date. If the Collections and 
proceeds of new Loans are insufficient to make all payments required under 
clauses (a), (b) and (c) and to pay the Servicing Fees and, if applicable, 
all expenses due and owing to any replacement Servicer under Section 8.1 
(all of the foregoing, collectively, the "Required Amounts") and Borrower 
has made any Demand Advances, Borrower shall make demand upon BSX for 
payment of the Demand Advances in an amount equal to the lesser of the 
Required Amounts or the aggregate outstanding principal balance of such 
Demand Advances (plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon) and, upon 
receipt of any such amounts, Borrower shall pay them to each of the 
Co-Agents, ratably in accordance with their respective Groups' Percentages, 
for distribution in accordance with this Section 3.2. (d) If the aggregate 
amount of Collections and payments on Demand Advances received by the 
Co-Agents on any Settlement Date are insufficient to pay all Required 
Amounts, the aggregate amount received shall be applied to the items 
specified in the subclauses below, in the order of priority of such 
subclauses: (i) to any accrued and unpaid interest on the Loans that is 
then due and owing, including any previously accrued interest which was not 
paid on its applicable due date; 10 (ii) if the Servicer is not Borrower or 
an Affiliate thereof, to any accrued and unpaid Servicing Fee that is then 
due and owing to such Servicer, together with any invoiced expenses of the 
Servicer due and owing pursuant to Section 10.3; (iii) to the fees due on 
such Settlement Date pursuant to the Amended Fee Letters, plus any fees 
previously accrued thereunder not paid on a prior Settlement Date; (iv) to 
the payment of the principal of any Loans that are then due and owing; (v) 
to other Obligations that are then due and owing; and (vi) if the Servicer 
is Borrower, BSX or one of their respective Affiliates, to the accrued and 
unpaid Servicing Fee that is then due and owing to such Servicer. (e) In 
addition to, but without duplication of, the foregoing, on (i) each 
Settlement Date and (ii) each other date on which any principal of or 
interest on any of the Loans becomes due (whether by acceleration or 
otherwise), the Servicer shall turn over to each of the Co-Agents, for 
distribution to the Lenders, a portion of the Collections equal to the 
aggregate amount of all Obligations that are due and owing to their 
respective Group on such date. Section 3.3 Non-Distribution of Servicing 
Fee. Each of the Agents and the other Secured Parties hereby agrees that 
prior to the occurrence of an Unmatured Amortization Event or an 
Amortization Event, the Servicer may retain a portion of the Collections 
equal to the Servicing Fee so long as the Collections received by the 
Servicer are sufficient to pay in full all amounts due pursuant to Section 
3.2(d). Section 3.4 Deemed Collections. If on any Settlement Date: (a) the 
aggregate Outstanding Balance of the Receivables as reflected in the most 
recent Monthly Report (net of any positive adjustments) has been reduced or 
cancelled for any of the following reasons: (i) as a result of any 
rejected, defective or returned services or merchandise, any cash discount 
or any other adjustment by the Borrower, the applicable Originator or any 
Affiliate thereof (regardless of whether the same is treated by such 
Originator or Affiliate as a write-off), or as a result of any surcharge or 
other governmental or regulatory action, or (ii) as a result of any setoff 
or breach of the underlying agreement in respect of any claim by the 
Obligor thereof against the Borrower, the applicable Originator or any 
Affiliate thereof (whether such claim arises out of the same or a related 
or an unrelated transaction), or (iii) on account of the obligation of the 
Borrower, the applicable Originator or any Affiliate thereof to pay to the 
related Obligor any rebate or refund, or 11 (iv) the Outstanding Balance of 
any Receivable is less than the amount included in calculating the Net Pool 
Balance for purposes of any Monthly Report (for any reason other than such 
Receivable becoming a Defaulted Receivable), or (b) any of the 
representations or warranties of the Borrower set forth in Section 6.1(n), 
(o) or (r) was not true when made with respect to any Receivable, or any of 
the representations or warranties of the Borrower set forth in Section 
6.1(m) is no longer true with respect to any Receivable, then, in such 
event, the Borrower shall be deemed to have received during the preceding 
Calculation Period a Collection in an amount equal to (A) the amount of 
such reduction, cancellation or overstatement, in the case of the preceding 
clauses (a)(i), (a)(ii), (a)(iii) and (a)(iv) or the difference between the 
actual Outstanding Balance and the amount included in respect of such 
Receivable in calculating the Net Pool Balance, as applicable, and (B) in 
the full amount of the Outstanding Balance of such Receivable in the case 
of the preceding clause (b). Section 3.5 Treatment of Collections and 
Deemed Collections. Borrower shall forthwith deliver to Servicer all Deemed 
Collections, and Servicer shall hold or distribute such Deemed Collections 
in the same manner as all other Collections are required to be held or 
distributed hereunder. ARTICLE IV FEES AND YIELD PROTECTION Section 4.1 
Fees. BSX or Borrower, as applicable, shall pay to each of the Agents and 
the Lenders certain fees from time to time in amounts and payable on such 
dates as are set forth in the Amended Fee Letters. Section 4.2 Yield 
Protection. (a) If any Regulatory Change occurring after the date hereof: 
(i) shall subject an Affected Party to any Tax (other than Excluded Taxes), 
duty or other charge with respect to its obligations hereunder or under any 
Funding Agreement or Enhancement Agreement, as applicable, its Commitment 
or its Liquidity Commitment, or shall change the basis of taxation of 
payments to the Affected Party of any Obligations, owed to or funded or 
maintained in whole or in part by it or any other amounts due under this 
Agreement in respect of its Obligations or, as applicable, its Commitment 
or its Liquidity Commitment; or (ii) shall impose, modify or deem 
applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against 
assets of any Affected Party, deposits or obligations with or for the 
account of any Affected Party or with or for the account of any affiliate 
(or entity deemed by the Federal Reserve Board to be an affiliate) of any 
Affected Party, or credit extended by any Affected Party pursuant to this 
Agreement, a Funding Agreement or an Enhancement Agreement, as applicable; 
or 12 (iii) shall affect the amount of capital required or expected to be 
maintained by any Affected Party; or (iv) shall impose any other condition 
affecting any obligation owned, funded or maintained in whole or in part by 
any Affected Party, or its rights or obligations, if any, to make Loans or 
Liquidity Fundings or to provide (or participate in) the funding or 
maintenance thereof; or (v) shall change the rate for, or the manner in 
which the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (or a successor thereto) 
assesses deposit insurance premiums or similar charges; and the result of 
any of the foregoing is or would be: (x) to increase the cost to or to 
impose a cost on (I) an Affected Party funding or making or maintaining (or 
providing or agreeing to provide funding for) any Loan, any Liquidity 
Funding or loans or other extensions of credit under any Funding Agreement 
or Enhancement Agreement or any commitment of such Affected Party with 
respect to any of the foregoing, or (II) any of the Agents for continuing 
its or Borrower's relationship with any Affected Party, in each case, in an 
amount deemed to be material by such Affected Party, (y) to reduce the 
amount of any sum received or receivable by an Affected Party under this 
Agreement or under any Liquidity Agreement or Enhancement Agreement, or (z) 
to reduce the rate of return on such Affected Party's capital as a 
consequence of its Obligations, its Commitment, its Liquidity Commitment, 
its obligations under any Enhancement Agreement or the Loans made by it or 
otherwise arising in connection herewith (or therewith) to a level below 
that which such Affected Party could have achieved but for the occurrence 
of such circumstances, then, within fifteen days after demand by such 
Affected Party (which demand shall be accompanied by a certificate setting 
forth the basis of such demand), Borrower shall pay directly to such 
Affected Party such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such 
Affected Party for such actual additional cost, increased cost or 
reduction. (b) Each Affected Party will promptly notify Borrower, the 
Administrative Agent and the applicable Co-Agent of any event of which it 
has knowledge which will entitle such Affected Party to compensation 
pursuant to this Section 4.2; provided, however, no failure to give or 
delay in giving such notification shall adversely affect the rights of any 
Affected Party to such compensation. (c) In determining any amount provided 
for or referred to in this Section 4.2, an Affected Party may use any 
reasonable averaging and attribution methods that it (in its sole 
discretion) shall deem applicable. Any Affected Party when making a claim 
under this Section 4.2 shall submit to Borrower the above-referenced 
certificate as to such actual increased cost or 13 actual reduced return 
(including calculation thereof in reasonable detail), which shall, in the 
absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding upon Borrower. Section 
4.3 Funding Losses. In the event that any Affected Party shall incur any 
loss or expense, including without limitation, any loss or expense incurred 
by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds 
acquired by such Affected Party, then, upon written notice from the 
applicable Co-Agent to the Administrative Agent, Borrower and the Servicer, 
Borrower shall pay to the Servicer, and the Servicer shall pay to the 
applicable Co-Agent for the account of such Affected Parties upon demand, 
the amount of such loss or expense (which shall include without limitation 
all Broken Funding Costs). Such written notice (which shall include the 
methodology for calculating, and the calculation of, the amount of such 
actual loss or expense, in reasonable detail) shall, in the absence of 
manifest error, be conclusive and binding upon Borrower and the Servicer. 
ARTICLE V CONDITIONS OF ADVANCES Section 5.1 Conditions Precedent to 
Initial Advance. The initial Advance under this Agreement was subject to 
the condition precedent that the Administrative Agent shall have received 
on or before the date of such Advance those documents listed on Schedule B

then true): (i) the representations and warranties set forth in Section 6.1 
and Article II of the Receivables Sale Agreement are true and correct in 
all material respects on and as of the date of such Advance (or such 
Settlement Date, as the case may be, except for representations and 
warranties stated to refer to a specific earlier date, in which case such 
representations and warranties are true and correct as of such earlier 
date) as though made on and as of such date and shall be deemed to have 
been made on such date; provided, however, that the preceding materiality 
standard shall not apply to those representations and warranties which 
themselves contain materiality standards; and provided, further, that so 
long as each of the Liquidity Banks remains a party to the BSX Credit 
Agreement, in no event will any Loan Party be required to "date-down" its

and (iv) after giving affect to the Loans made by each Group included in 
such Advance (or the continuation thereof), the aggregate principal of such 
Loans will not exceed the Allocation Limit of such Group. Section 5.3 
Conditions Precedent to Effectiveness. This Amended and Restated Credit and 
Security Agreement shall become effective at such time as the Agents shall 
have received the documents listed on Schedule C to this Agreement. ARTICLE 
VI REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES Section 6.1 Representations and 
Warranties of the Loan Parties. Each Loan Party hereby represents and 
warrants to the Agents and the Lenders, as to itself in any capacity, as of 
the date hereof, as of the date of each Advance and as of each Settlement 
Date as follows; provided, however, that so long as each of the Liquidity 
Banks remains a party to the BSX Credit Agreement, in no event will any 
Loan Party be required to "date-down" its representation in Section 6.1(b) 
or 6.1(g): (a) Financial Condition. The consolidated balance sheet of BSX 
and its consolidated Subsidiaries as at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 
2005 and the related consolidated statements of operations and of cash 
flows for the fiscal years ended on such dates, reported on by Ernst & 
Young LLP, copies of which have heretofore been furnished to Borrower and 
Lenders, are complete and correct and present fairly the consolidated 
financial condition of BSX as at such dates, and the consolidated results 
of its operations and its consolidated cash flows for the fiscal years then 
ended. The unaudited consolidated balance sheet of BSX and its consolidated 
Subsidiaries as at September 30, 2007 or, if later and prior to the date of 
this Agreement, the date of BSX's most recent publicly available Form 10-Q 
and the related unaudited consolidated statements of operations and of cash 
flows for the fiscal period ended on such date, certified by an Authorized 
Officer, copies of which have heretofore been furnished to each Lender, are 
complete and materially correct and present fairly (subject to normal 
year-end audit adjustments) the consolidated financial condition of BSX and 
its consolidated Subsidiaries as at such date, and the consolidated results 
of its operations and its consolidated cash flows for the fiscal period 
then ended. All such annual financial statements, including the related 
schedules and notes thereto, were, as of the date prepared, prepared in 
accordance with GAAP applied consistently throughout the periods involved 
(except as approved by such accountants or an Authorized Officer, as the 
case may be, and as disclosed therein). The quarterly financial statements 
have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles for interim financial information and with the instructions to 
Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act of 
1933. Accordingly, such quarterly statements do not include all of the 
information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial 
statements. In the opinion of BXS, all adjustments (consisting only of 
normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation 
have been included. Neither BSX nor any of its consolidated Subsidiaries 
had, at the date of the most recent balance sheet referred to above, any 
material 15 Guarantee Obligation, material contingent liability or material 
liability for taxes, or any material long-term lease or material unusual 
forward or long-term commitment, including, without limitation, any 
interest rate or foreign currency swap or exchange transaction, which is 
not reflected in the foregoing statements or in the notes thereto. (b) No 
Change. Since the date of the most recent financial statements filed with 
BSX's Form 10-Q or Form 10-K (or the equivalent thereof) under the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, in the case of BSX, and since 
the date of formation in the case of Borrower, there has been no 
development or event which has had or could reasonably be expected to have 
a Material Adverse Effect. (c) Ownership of Borrower and Originators. BSX 
owns, directly or indirectly, all the issued and outstanding Equity 
Interests of (i) the Borrower and (ii) each of the other Originators (if 
any), and all of such Equity Interests are fully paid and non-assessable. 
(d) Corporate Existence; Compliance with Law. Each Loan Party and its 
Subsidiaries, if any, (a) is duly organized, validly existing and in good 
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, (b) has 
the corporate or other power and authority, and the legal right, to own and 
operate its property, to lease the property it operates as lessee and to 
conduct the business in which it is currently engaged, (c) is duly 
qualified as a foreign corporation or other entity and in good standing 
under the laws of each jurisdiction where its ownership, lease or operation 
of property or the conduct of its business requires such qualification and 
(d) is in compliance with all Requirements of Law, except to the extent 
that the failure of the foregoing clauses (a), (c) and (d) to be true and 
correct could not, in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a 
Material Adverse Effect. (e) Corporate Power; Authorization; Enforceable 
Obligations. Each Loan Party has the corporate or other power and 
authority, and the legal right, to make, deliver and perform its 
obligations under each Transaction Document to which it is a party and to 
consummate the transactions herein and therein contemplated and has taken 
all necessary corporate or limited liability company action to authorize 
the consummation of the transactions herein and therein contemplated and to 
authorize the execution, delivery and performance of the Transaction 
Documents to which it is a party. Except for filings with respect to the 
disclosure of the Transaction Documents pursuant to the Securities Exchange 
Act of 1934, as amended (all of which filings shall be made at or prior to 
the time required under applicable law), no consent or authorization of, 
filing with, notice to or other act by or in respect of, any Governmental 
Authority or any other Person is required with respect to such Loan Party 
or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions hereunder or 
with the execution, delivery, performance, validity or enforceability of 
the Transaction Documents to which such Loan Party is a party. This 
Agreement and each other Transaction Document to which such Loan Party is, 
or is to become, a party has been or will be, as applicable, duly executed 
and delivered on behalf of such Loan Party. This Agreement and each other 
Transaction Document to which such Loan Party is, or is to become, a party 
constitutes or will constitute, as applicable, a legal, valid and binding 
obligation of such Loan Party enforceable against such Loan Party in 
accordance with its terms, subject to the effects of bankruptcy, 
insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other 
similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally, general 
16 equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at 
law) and an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. (f) No Legal 
Bar. The execution, delivery and performance of the Transaction Documents 
and transactions contemplated hereunder will not violate any Requirement of 
Law or Contractual Obligation of such Loan Party or of any of its 
Subsidiaries which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse 
Effect and will not result in, or require, the creation or imposition of 
any Lien (except for any Lien permitted by, or created pursuant to, any of 
the Transaction Documents) on any of its or their respective properties or 
revenues pursuant to any such Requirement of Law or Contractual Obligation 
which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. (g) 
No Material Litigation. Except as disclosed in BSX's most recent publicly 
available Form 10-K or, if later, the date of BSX's most recent publicly 
available Form 10-Q, no litigation, investigation or proceeding of or 
before any arbitrator or Governmental Authority is pending or, to the 
knowledge of such Loan Party, threatened by or against such Loan Party or 
any of its Subsidiaries or against any of its or its respective properties 
or revenues (a) with respect to any of the Transaction Documents or any of 
the transactions contemplated hereby, or (b) which could reasonably be 
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. (h) No Default. Neither 
Servicer nor any of its Subsidiaries (other than Borrower) is in default 
under or with respect to any of its Contractual Obligations in excess of 
$100,000,000. Borrower is not in default under or with respect to any of 
its Contractual Obligations in any respect which could reasonably be 
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. No Unmatured Amortization Event 
or Amortization Event has occurred and is continuing. (i) Taxes. Each of 
such Loan Party and its Subsidiaries has filed or caused to be filed all 
tax returns which, to the knowledge of such Loan Party, are required to be 
filed and has paid all taxes shown to be due and payable on said returns or 
on any assessments made against it (other than any the amount or validity 
of which are currently being contested in good faith by appropriate 
proceedings and with respect to which reserves in conformity with GAAP have 
been provided on the books of such Loan Party or its Subsidiaries, as the 
case may be), except to the extent that the failure to do so could not 
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. (j) Use of 
Proceeds. The use of all funds obtained by the Borrower under this 
Agreement or any other Transaction Document to which it is a party will not 
(i) violate Regulation U of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve 
System as now and from time to time hereafter in effect, (ii) violate 
Section 7.2(e) of this Agreement or (iii) be to acquire any security which 
is subject to Section 12, 13 or 14 of the Exchange Act. (k) Investment 
Company Act; Other Regulations. Such Loan Party is not an "investment 
company", or a company "controlled" by an "investment company", within the 
meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. Such Loan Party 
is not subject to regulation under any Federal or State statute or 
regulation (other than Regulation X of the Board) which limits its ability 
to incur Indebtedness. 17 (l) Accuracy of Information. (i) Monthly Reports. 
Each Monthly Report delivered pursuant to this Agreement was true and 
accurate in every material respect on the date specified in such report and 
did not contain any material misstatement of fact or omit to state a 
material fact or any fact necessary to make the statements contained 
therein not misleading. (ii) Pre-Closing Collateral Information. All 
information regarding the Collateral or any Loan Party furnished by any 
Loan Party or any of its Affiliates to any of the Agents or Lenders prior 
to the date of this Agreement was true and accurate in every material 
respect on the date such information was so furnished except as otherwise 
disclosed to the Agents and the Lenders prior to the date hereof and, when 
taken as a whole together with such subsequent disclosures, did not contain 
any material misstatement of fact or omit to state a material fact or any 
fact necessary to make the statements contained therein not misleading. 
(iii) Ongoing Collateral Information. All other information regarding the 
Collateral not covered by clauses (i) and (ii) above which is hereafter 
furnished by any Loan Party to any of the Agents or Lenders will be true 
and accurate in every material respect on the date such information is so 
furnished and, when taken as a whole, will not contain any material 
misstatement of fact or omit to state a material fact or any fact necessary 
to make the statements contained therein not misleading as of the date when 
so furnished. (iv) Other Information. All other information regarding any 
Loan Party, its business, operations, financial condition or prospects 
furnished by any Loan Party to any of the Agents or Lenders in connection 
with the Transaction Documents after the date of this Agreement that is not 
covered by clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) above, will be true and accurate in 
every material respect on the date such information is so furnished and, 
when taken as a whole together with any subsequent updates to such 
information, will not contain any material misstatement of fact or omit to 
state a material fact or any fact necessary to make the statements 
contained therein not misleading as of the date when furnished or updated. 
(m) Valid and Perfected Security Interest. The Borrower has a perfected 
ownership interest in each Receivable, and each Receivable is owned by the 
Borrower free and clear of any Lien except as created hereby or by the 
other Transaction Documents. Without limiting the foregoing, Borrower has 
delivered to the Administrative Agent in form suitable for filing all 
financing statements or other similar instruments or documents necessary 
under the UCC of all appropriate jurisdictions to perfect the 
Administrative Agent's security interest in the Receivables and Related 
Security. This Agreement creates a valid security interest in each such 
Receivable and its Related Security in favor of the Administrative Agent, 
and, upon filing of the financing statements described in the preceding 
sentence, together with UCC termination statements delivered as a condition 
precedent to the initial Advance hereunder, such security interest will be 
a first priority perfected security interest. 18 (n) Nature of Receivables. 
Each Receivable constitutes an "Account" and is not a 
"Health-care-insurance receivable," in each case, as defined in the UCC in 
effect in the State of New York. (o) Title to Receivables and Quality of 
Title. No financing statement or other instrument similar in effect 
creating any Lien on any portion of the Collateral is on file in any 
recording office except such as may be filed (i) in favor of an Originator 
in accordance with the Contracts, (ii) in favor of the Borrower and its 
assigns in connection with the Receivables Sale Agreement, (iii) in favor 
of the Administrative Agent in accordance with this Agreement, (iv) in 
connection with any Lien arising solely as the result of any action taken 
by the Administrative Agent or one of the Secured Parties, or (v) which 
shall be terminated or amended pursuant to the UCC termination statements 
or amendments delivered as a condition precedent to this Agreement. (p) 
Offices. The chief executive office of such Loan Party is located at the 
address set forth for it on Exhibit III hereto, and the offices where such 
Loan Party keep all books, records and documents evidencing the Receivables 
(other than books, records and documents that are stored off-site with 
respect to Receivables which are no longer outstanding or which have been 
written-off), the related material Contracts and all purchase orders and 
other agreements related to such Receivables are located at the addresses 
specified in Exhibit III hereto or its Joinder Agreement (or at such other 
locations, notified to the Administrative Agent in accordance with Section 
7.2(a), in jurisdictions where all action required by Section 6.1(m) has 
been taken and completed). Such Loan Party's jurisdiction of organization 
and organizational identification number are also correctly set forth on 
Exhibit III hereto. As of the date hereof, each Loan Party is a "registered 
organization" (within the meaning of Section 9-102 of the UCC as in effect 
in its jurisdiction of organization). Since the date of this Agreement, no 
Loan Party has changed its jurisdiction of organization. (q) Collection 
Accounts. The conditions and requirements set forth in Sections 7.1(h) and 
7.1(m) have at all times been satisfied and duly performed. The names, 
addresses and jurisdictions of organization of all Collection Banks, 
together with the account numbers of the Collection Accounts of Borrower at 
each Collection Bank and the post office box number of each Lockbox, are 
listed on Exhibit IV. Borrower has not granted any Person, other than the 
Administrative Agent as contemplated by this Agreement, dominion and 
control of any Lockbox or Collection Account, or the right to take dominion 
and control of any such Lockbox or Collection Account at a future time or 
upon the occurrence of a future event. (r) Eligible Receivables. Each 
Receivable included in the Net Pool Balance as an Eligible Receivable on 
the date of any Monthly Report or Borrowing Base calculation was an 
Eligible Receivable on such date. (s) Names. Except as set forth in Exhibit 
III hereto, since its formation, Borrower has not used any legal names, 
trade names or assumed names other than the name in which it has executed 
this Agreement. (t) Credit and Collection Policy. Such Loan Party has 
complied in all material respects with the applicable Credit and Collection 
Policy, and no change has been made 19 to such Credit and Collection Policy 
since the date of this Agreement which would be reasonably likely to 
materially and adversely affect the collectibility of the Receivables or 
decrease the credit quality of any newly created Receivables except for 
such changes as to which each of the Agents has received not less than 30 
days' prior written notice of the proposed change and has given its prior 
written consent thereto (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld 
or delayed). (u) Payments to Originators. With respect to each Receivable 
sold or contributed to the Borrower under the Receivables Sale Agreement, 
the Borrower has given reasonably equivalent value to the applicable 
Originator in consideration for such Receivable and the Related Security 
with respect thereto and no such transfer is or may be voidable under any 
section of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 (11 U.S.C. S.S.101 et seq.), 
as amended. (v) Reliance on Separate Legal Identity. Such Loan Party is 
aware that the Lenders, the Liquidity Banks and the Agents are entering 
into the Transaction Documents in reliance upon the Borrower's identity as 
a legal entity separate from such Loan Party and any of its other 
Affiliates. (w) Compliance with Law. (i) Such Loan Party has complied in 
all respects with all applicable laws, rules, regulations, orders, writs, 
judgments, injunctions, decrees or awards to which it is subject, except 
where the failure to so comply could not reasonably be expected to have a 
Material Adverse Effect; and (ii) each Receivable, together with any 
Contract related thereto, does not contravene any laws, rules or 
regulations applicable thereto (including, without limitation, laws, rules 
and regulations relating to truth in lending, fair credit billing, fair 
credit reporting, equal credit opportunity, fair debt collection practices 
and privacy), except where such contravention could not reasonably be 
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. (x) Aggregate Commitment. 
Immediately after giving effect to each Advance and each settlement on any 
Settlement Date hereunder, the Aggregate Principal is less than or equal to 
the Aggregate Commitment. (y) Accounting. The manner in which such Loan 
Party accounts for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the 
Receivables Sale Agreement is consistent with and will not result in the 
transfer from the Originators to the Borrower under the Receivables Sale 
Agreement to be or be characterized as anything other than a true sale 
under law and for accounting purposes. (z) Receivables Sale Agreement. Each 
Originator's representations and warranties contained in the Receivables 
Sale Agreement is true and correct in all material respects and is made to 
the Lenders, the Agents and the other parties hereto as if set forth herein 
in full together with the related definitions. (aa) Servicing Programs. No 
license or approval is required for any Agent's use of any software or 
other similar program used by any Originator or Servicer in the servicing 
of the Receivables, other than those which have been obtained and are in 
full force and effect. 20 ARTICLE VII COVENANTS Section 7.1 Affirmative

of Law: (i) at any time and from time to time upon not less than ten (10) 
Business Days' notice (unless an or Amortization Event has occurred and is 
continuing, in which case, not more than one (1) Business Day's notice 
shall be required) during regular business hours, permit the Agents or any

such Loan Party's performance hereunder with any of the officers or 
employees of such Loan Party having knowledge of such matters; and (ii) 
without limiting the provisions of clause (i) above, from time to time, at 
the expense of such Loan Party, permit certified public accountants or 
auditors acceptable to the Agents to conduct a review of the Contracts, 
Invoices and Records (each, a "Review"); provided, however, that, so long 
as no Amortization Event has occurred and is continuing, the Loan Parties 
shall only be responsible for the costs and expenses of one (1) such Review 
under this Section in any one calendar year unless (1) the first such 
Review in such calendar year resulted in negative findings (in which case 
the Loan Parties shall be responsible for the costs and expenses of two (2) 
such Reviews in such calendar year), or (2) the Borrower delivers an 
Extension Request and the applicable Response Date is more than 3 calendar 
months after the first Review in such calendar year. Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, if the Borrower requests the approval of a new Eligible 
Originator who is a Material Proposed Addition, the Loan Parties shall be 
responsible for the costs and expenses of one additional Review per 
proposed Material Proposed Addition in the calendar year in which such 
Material Proposed Addition is expected to occur if such additional Review 
is requested by any of the Agents. (e) Keeping of Records and Books of 
Account. Such Loan Party will maintain and implement administrative and 
operating procedures (including, without limitation, an ability to recreate 
essential Records evidencing the Receivables in the event of the 
destruction of the originals thereof and backing up such Records on at 
least a daily basis on a separate computer from which electronic file 
copies can be readily produced), and keep and maintain, all Contracts, 
Records and other information necessary or reasonably advisable for the 
collection of all such Receivables (including, without limitation, Records 
adequate to permit the identification as of any Business Day when required 
of Outstanding Balances by Obligor and related debit and credit details of 
the Receivables). (f) Location of Records. Such Loan Party will keep its 
Records and material Contracts (and, to the extent that any of the 
foregoing constitute instruments, chattel paper or negotiable documents, 
all originals thereof), at its addresses referred to in Exhibit III hereto, 
or, upon 30 days' prior written notice to the Agents, at such other 
locations in jurisdictions where all action required by Section 6.1(m) 
shall have been taken and completed. (g) Credit and Collection Policies. 
Such Loan Party will comply in all material respects with the Credit and 
Collection Policy in regard to the Receivables and will require each 
applicable Originator to timely and fully perform and comply with all 
provisions, covenants and other promises required to be observed by it 
under the related Contracts and Invoices. 23 (h) Collections. Such Loan 
Party will instruct all Obligors thereon to pay all Collections either 
directly by mail addressed to a Lockbox listed on Exhibit IV hereto which

Further Assurances. Such Loan Party shall take all necessary action to 
establish and maintain in favor of the Buyer, a valid and perfected 
ownership interest in the Receivables and Related Security. (j) Performance 
and Enforcement of the Receivables Sale Agreement. Borrower will, and will 
require each Originator to, perform each of their respective obligations 
and undertakings under and pursuant to the Receivables Sale Agreement, will 
purchase Receivables thereunder in strict compliance with the terms thereof 
and will vigorously enforce the rights and remedies accorded to Borrower 
under the Receivables Sale Agreement. Borrower will take all actions 
necessary to perfect and enforce its rights and interests (and the rights 
and interests of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders as assignees of 
Borrower) under the Receivables Sale Agreement as the Administrative Agent 
may from time to time reasonably request, including, without limitation, 
making claims to which it may be entitled under any indemnity, 
reimbursement or similar provision contained in the Receivables Sale 
Agreement. (k) Ownership. Borrower will (or will require each Originator 
to) take all necessary action to (i) vest legal and equitable title to the 
Collateral acquired by Borrower under the Receivables Sale Agreement 
irrevocably in Borrower, free and clear of any Adverse Claims (other than 
Adverse Claims in favor of the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the 
Secured Parties) including, without limitation, the filing of all financing 
statements or other similar instruments or documents necessary under the 
UCC (or any comparable law) of all appropriate jurisdictions to perfect 
Borrower's interest in such Collateral and such other necessary action to 
perfect, protect or more fully evidence the interest of Borrower therein as 
the Administrative Agent may reasonably request, and (ii) establish and 
maintain, in favor of the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the 
Secured Parties, a valid and perfected first priority perfected security 
interest in all Collateral, free and clear of any Adverse Claims, 
including, without limitation, the filing of all financing statements or 
other similar instruments or documents necessary under the UCC (or any 
comparable law) of all appropriate jurisdictions to perfect the 
Administrative Agent's (for the benefit of the Secured Parties) security 
interest in the Collateral and such other action to perfect, protect or 
more fully evidence the interest of the Administrative Agent for the 
benefit of the Secured Parties as the Administrative Agent may reasonably 
request. (l) Separate Existence of the Borrower. Each Loan Party hereby 
acknowledges that Lenders and the Agents are entering into the transactions 
contemplated hereby in reliance upon the Borrower's identity as a legal 
entity separate from the Servicer and its other Affiliates. Therefore, each 
Loan Party shall take all steps specifically required by this Agreement or 
reasonably required by any of the Agents to continue the Borrower's 
identity as a separate legal entity and to make it apparent to third 
Persons that the Borrower is an entity with assets and liabilities distinct 
from those of its Affiliates, and is not a division of BSX or any other 
Person (including complying with and causing to be true and correct each of 
the facts and 24 assumptions contained in the legal opinion of Shearman & 
Sterling). Without limiting the foregoing, each Loan Party will take such 
actions as shall be required in order that: (i) The Borrower will be a 
limited purpose limited liability company whose primary activities are 
restricted in its limited liability company agreement to purchasing or 
otherwise acquiring from any of the Originators, owning, holding, granting 
security interests in the Collateral, entering into agreements for the 
financing and servicing of the Receivables, and conducting such other 
activities as it deems necessary or appropriate to carry out its primary 
activities; (ii) The Borrower's independent manager (the "Independent 
Manager") shall be an individual who is not, and never has been, a direct, 
indirect or beneficial stockholder, member, officer, director, employee, 
affiliate, associate, material supplier or material customer of BSX or any 
of its Affiliates (other than an Affiliate organized with a limited purpose 
charter for the purpose of acquiring receivables or other financial assets 
or intangible property). The limited liability company agreement of the 
Borrower shall provide that (A) so long as any Obligations are outstanding, 
the Borrower at all times shall have at least one Independent Manager, (B) 
the Borrower's members shall not approve, or take any other action to cause 
the filing of, a voluntary bankruptcy petition with respect to the Borrower 
unless the Independent Manager shall approve the taking of such action in 
writing prior to the taking of such action and (C) the provisions requiring 
an independent member and the provisions described in clauses (A) and (B) 
of this paragraph (ii) cannot be amended without the prior written consent 
of the Independent Manager; (iii) The Independent Manager shall not at any 
time serve as a trustee in bankruptcy for the Borrower or any Affiliate 
thereof; (iv) Any director, manager, employee, consultant or agent of the 
Borrower will be compensated from the Borrower's funds for services 
provided to the Borrower. The Borrower will not engage any agents other 
than its attorneys, auditors and other professionals and a servicer and any 
other agent contemplated by the Transaction Documents for the Collateral, 
which servicer will be fully compensated for its services by payment of the 
Servicing Fee, and certain organizational expenses in connection with the 
formation of the Borrower; (v) The Borrower will contract with the Servicer 
to perform for the Borrower all operations required on a daily basis to 
service the Collateral. The Borrower will pay the Servicer the Servicing 
Fee pursuant hereto. The Borrower will not incur any material indirect or 
overhead expenses for items shared with BSX (or any other Affiliate 
thereof) which are not reflected in the Servicing Fee. To the extent, if 
any, that the Borrower (or any other Affiliate thereof) shares items of 
expenses not reflected in the Servicing Fee, for legal, auditing and other 
professional services and directors' fees, such expenses will be allocated 
to the extent practical on the basis of actual use or the value of services 
25 rendered, and otherwise on a basis reasonably related to the actual use 
or the value of services rendered, it being understood that BSX shall pay 
all expenses relating to the preparation, negotiation, execution and 
delivery of the Transaction Documents, including, without limitation, 
legal, rating agency and other fees; (vi) The Borrower's operating expenses 
will not be paid by any other Loan Party or other Affiliate of the 
Borrower; (vii) The Borrower will have its own stationery; (viii) The books 
of account, financial reports and records of the Borrower will be 
maintained separately from those of BSX and each other Affiliate of the 
Borrower; (ix) Any financial statements of any Loan Party or Affiliate 
thereof which are consolidated to include the Borrower will contain 
detailed notes clearly stating that (A) all of the Borrower's assets are 
owned by the Borrower, and (B) the Borrower is a separate legal entity with 
its own separate creditors that will be entitled to be satisfied out of the 
Borrower's assets prior to any value in the Borrower becoming available to 
the Borrower's equity holders; and the accounting records and the published 
financial statements of each of the Originators will clearly show that, for 
accounting purposes, the Receivables and Related Assets have been sold by 
such Originator to the Borrower; (x) The Borrower's assets will be 
maintained in a manner that facilitates their identification and 
segregation from those of the Servicer and the other Affiliates; (xi) Each 
Affiliate of the Borrower will strictly observe organizational formalities 
in its dealings with the Borrower, and, except as permitted pursuant to 
this Agreement with respect to Collections, funds or other assets of the 
Borrower will not be commingled with those of any of its Affiliates; (xii) 
No Affiliate of the Borrower will maintain joint bank accounts with the 
Borrower or other depository accounts with the Borrower to which any such 
Affiliate (other than in the Borrower's or such Affiliate's existing or 
future capacity as the Servicer hereunder or under the Receivables Sale 
Agreement) has independent access; (xiii) Each Affiliate of the Borrower 
will maintain arm's length relationships with the Borrower, and each 
Affiliate of the Borrower that renders or otherwise furnishes services or 
merchandise to the Borrower will be compensated by the Borrower at market 
rates for such services or merchandise; (xiv) No Affiliate of the Borrower 
will be, nor will it hold itself out to be, responsible for the debts of 
the Borrower or the decisions or actions in respect of the daily business 
and affairs of the Borrower. BSX and the Borrower will immediately correct 
any known misrepresentation with respect to the foregoing 26 and they will 
not operate or purport to operate as an integrated single economic unit 
with respect to each other or in their dealing with any other entity; (xv) 
The Borrower will keep correct and complete books and records of account 
and minutes of the meetings and other proceedings of its member(s) and the 
resolutions, agreements and other instruments of the Borrower will be 
continuously maintained as official records by the Borrower; and (xvi) The 
Borrower will conduct its business solely in its own legal name and in a 
manner separate from the Originators so as not to mislead others with whom 
they are dealing. (m) Collections. BSX and Borrower will cause (1) all 
proceeds from all Lockboxes to be directly deposited by a Collection Bank 
into a Collection Account and (2) each Lockbox and Collection Account to be 
subject at all times to a Collection Account Agreement that is in full 
force and effect. In the event any payments relating to the Collateral are 
remitted directly to Borrower or any Affiliate of Borrower, Borrower will 
remit (or will cause all such payments to be remitted) directly to a 
Collection Bank and deposited into a Collection Account within two (2) 
Business Days following receipt thereof, and, at all times prior to such 
remittance, Borrower will itself hold or, if applicable, will cause such 
payments to be held in trust for the exclusive benefit of the 
Administrative Agent and the Lenders. Borrower will maintain exclusive 
ownership of each Lockbox and Collection Account and shall not grant the 
right to take dominion and control of any Lockbox or Collection Account at 
a future time or upon the occurrence of a future event to any Person, 
except to the Administrative Agent as contemplated by this Agreement. (n) 
Taxes. Such Loan Party will file all tax returns and reports required by 
law to be filed by it and will promptly pay all taxes and governmental 
charges at any time owing, except any such taxes which are not yet 
delinquent or are being diligently contested in good faith by appropriate 
proceedings and for which adequate reserves in accordance with GAAP shall 
have been set aside on its books. Borrower will pay when due any taxes 
payable in connection with the Receivables, exclusive of taxes on or 
measured by income or gross receipts of any Agent or any Lender. (o) 
Payment to Originators. With respect to any Receivable purchased by 
Borrower from any Originator, such sale shall be effected under, and in 
strict compliance with the terms of (including any grace periods contained 
therein), the Receivables Sale Agreement, including, without limitation, 
the terms relating to the amount and timing of payments to be made to the 
applicable Originator in respect of the purchase price for such Receivable. 
Section 7.2 Negative Covenants of the Loan Parties. Until the Final Payout 
Date, each Loan Party hereby covenants, as to itself, that: (a) Name 
Change, Offices and Records. Borrower and Servicer will not, and will not 
consent to any request by any Originator to, change its name, identity, 
jurisdiction of organization or corporate structure (within the meaning of 
Sections 9-503 and/or 9-507 of the UCC of all applicable jurisdictions) or 
relocate its chief executive office, principal place of 27 business or any 
office where Records are kept unless it shall have: (i) given Borrower and 
the Administrative Agent at least forty-five (45) days' prior written 
notice thereof and (ii) delivered to the Administrative Agent all financing 
statements, instruments and other documents reasonably and promptly 
requested by the Administrative Agent in connection with such change or 
relocation. (b) Change in Payment Instructions to Obligors. Except as may 
be required by the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 8.2(b), no Loan 
Party will add or terminate any bank as a Collection Bank, or make any 
change in the instructions to Obligors regarding payments to be made to any 
Lockbox or Collection Account, unless the Administrative Agent shall have 
received, at least ten (10) days before the proposed effective date 
therefor, (i) written notice of such addition, termination or change and 
(ii) with respect to the addition of a Collection Bank or a Collection 
Account or Lockbox, an executed Collection Account Agreement with respect 
to the new Collection Account or Lockbox; provided, however, that the 
Servicer may make changes in instructions to Obligors without any prior 
notice regarding payments if such new instructions require such Obligor to 
make payments to another existing Collection Account. No Loan Party will 
deposit or authorize the deposit to any Collection Account of any cash or 
cash proceeds other than Collections of Receivables; it being understood 
and agreed that no Loan Party shall be deemed to have breached the covenant 
set forth in this Section 7.2(b) solely by virtue of any deposits to any 
Collection Account of any cash or cash proceeds to the extent such deposit 
has not been authorized by such Loan Party. (c) Modifications to Contracts 
and Credit and Collection Policy. Such Loan Party will not, and will not 
permit any Originator to, make any change to the Credit and Collection 
Policy that could adversely affect the collectibility of the Receivables or 
decrease the credit quality of any newly created Receivables. Except as 
provided in Section 8.2(d), the Servicer will not, and will not permit any 
Originator to, extend, amend or otherwise modify the terms of any 
Receivable or any Contract related thereto other than in accordance with 
the Credit and Collection Policy. (d) Sales, Liens. Except as otherwise 
contemplated by the Transaction Documents, no Loan Party will sell, assign 
(by operation of law or otherwise) or otherwise dispose of, or grant any 
option with respect to, or create or suffer to exist any Adverse Claim upon 
(including, without limitation, the filing of any financing statement) or 
with respect to, any of the Collateral, or assign any right to receive 
income with respect thereto (other than, in each case, the creation of a 
security interest therein in favor of the Administrative Agent as provided 
for herein), and each Loan Party will defend the right, title and interest 
of the Secured Parties in, to and under any of the foregoing property, 
against all claims of third parties claiming through or under Borrower or 
any Originator. No Loan Party will create or suffer to exist any mortgage, 
pledge, security interest, encumbrance, lien, charge or other similar 
arrangement on any of its inventory. (e) Use of Proceeds. Borrower will not 
use the proceeds of the Advances for any purpose other than (i) paying for 
Receivables and Related Security under and in accordance with the 
Receivables Sale Agreement, including without limitation, making payments 
on the Subordinated Notes to the extent permitted thereunder and under the 
Receivables Sale Agreement, (ii) making Demand Advances to BSX at any time 
prior to the Facility Termination 28 Date while it is acting as Servicer 
and no Amortization Event or Unmatured Amortization Event exists and is 
continuing, (iii) paying its ordinary and necessary operating expenses when 
and as due, and (iv) making Restricted Junior Payments to the extent 
permitted under this Agreement. (f) Restricted Junior Payments. Borrower 
will not make any Restricted Junior Payment if after giving effect thereto, 
Borrower's Net Worth would be less than the Required Capital Amount (as 
defined in the Receivables Sale Agreement). (g) Borrower Indebtedness. 
Borrower will not incur or permit to exist any Indebtedness except: (i) the 
Obligations, (ii) the Subordinated Loans, and (iii) other current accounts 
payable arising in the ordinary course of business and not overdue. (h) 
Prohibition on Additional Negative Pledges. No Loan Party will enter into 
or assume any agreement (other than this Agreement and the other 
Transaction Documents) prohibiting the creation or assumption of any 
Adverse Claim upon the Collateral except as contemplated by the Transaction 
Documents, or otherwise prohibiting or restricting any transaction 
contemplated hereby or by the other Transaction Documents, and no Loan 
Party will enter into or assume any agreement creating any Adverse Claim 
upon the Subordinated Notes. ARTICLE VIII ADMINISTRATION AND COLLECTION 
Section 8.1 Designation of Servicer. (a) The servicing, administration and 
collection of the Receivables shall be conducted by the Person designated 
as Servicer hereunder ("Servicer") from time to time in accordance with 
this Section 8.1. Until the Administrative Agent gives to BSX a Successor 
Notice (as defined in Section 8.1(b)), BSX is hereby designated as, and 
hereby agrees to perform the duties and obligations of, Servicer pursuant 
to the terms hereof. (b) Upon BSX's receipt of a notice from the 
Administrative Agent of the Administrative Agent's designation of a new 
Servicer pursuant to the terms hereof (a "Successor Notice"), BSX agrees 
that it shall terminate its activities as Servicer hereunder in a manner 
that the Administrative Agent reasonably believes will facilitate the 
transition of the performance of such activities to the new Servicer, and 
the Administrative Agent (or its designee) shall assume each and all of 
BSX's obligations to service and administer such Receivables, on the terms 
and subject to the conditions herein set forth, and BSX shall use its best 
efforts to assist the Administrative Agent (or its designee) in assuming 
such obligations. The Administrative Agent agrees not to give BSX a 
Successor Notice until after the occurrence of an Amortization Event. (c) 
BSX may delegate to each other Originator, as sub-servicer of the Servicer, 
certain of its duties and responsibilities as Servicer hereunder in respect 
of the Receivables. Without the prior written consent of the Agents, BSX 
shall not be permitted to delegate any of its duties or responsibilities as 
Servicer to any Person other than (i) Borrower, (ii) any other Originator, 
and (iii) with respect to certain Defaulted Receivables, outside collection 
agencies in accordance with its customary practices. Neither Borrower nor 
any other Originator shall be permitted to further delegate to any other 
Person any of the duties or responsibilities of the Servicer delegated to 
it by BSX. If at any time the Administrative Agent shall designate as 29 
Servicer any Person other than BSX, all duties and responsibilities 
theretofore delegated by BSX to Borrower or any other Originator may, at 
the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be terminated forthwith on 
notice given by the Administrative Agent to BSX and to Borrower and the 
applicable Originator. (d) Notwithstanding delegation under the foregoing 
subsection (c): (i) BSX shall be and remain primarily liable to the Agents 
and the Lenders for the full and prompt performance of all duties and 
responsibilities of the Servicer hereunder and (ii) the Agents and the 
Lenders shall be entitled to deal exclusively with BSX in matters relating 
to the discharge by the Servicer of its duties and responsibilities 
hereunder. The Agents and the Lenders shall not be required to give notice, 
demand or other communication to any Person other than BSX in order for 
communication to the Servicer and its sub-servicer or other delegate with 
respect thereto to be accomplished. BSX, at all times that it is the 
Servicer, shall be responsible for providing any sub-servicer or other 
delegate of the Servicer with any notice given to the Servicer under this 
Agreement. (e) Power of Attorney. Each Loan Party hereby grants to Servicer 
(if other than such Loan Party) an irrevocable power of attorney, with full 
power of substitution, coupled with an interest, to take in the name of 
such Loan Party all steps which are necessary or advisable to endorse, 
negotiate, enforce, or otherwise realize on any writing or other right of 
any kind held or transmitted by such Loan Party or transmitted or received 
by such Loan Party in connection with any Collateral. Section 8.2 Duties of 
Servicer. (a) The Servicer shall take or cause to be taken all such actions 
as may be necessary or advisable to collect each Receivable from time to 
time, all in accordance with applicable laws, rules and regulations, with 
reasonable care and diligence, and in accordance with the Credit and 
Collection Policy. (b) The Servicer will instruct all Obligors to pay all 
Collections directly to a Lockbox or Collection Account. The Servicer shall 
effect a Collection Account Agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit 
VI with each bank party to a Collection Account at any time. In the case of 
any remittances received in any Lockbox or Collection Account that shall 
have been identified, to the satisfaction of the Servicer, to not 
constitute Collections or other proceeds of the Receivables or the Related 
Security, the Servicer shall promptly remit such items to the Person 
identified to it as being the owner of such remittances. From and after the 
date the Administrative Agent delivers to any Collection Bank a Collection 
Notice pursuant to Section 8.3, the Administrative Agent may request that 
the Servicer, and the Servicer thereupon promptly shall instruct all 
Obligors with respect to the Receivables, to remit all payments thereon to 
a new depositary account specified by the Administrative Agent and, at all 
times thereafter, Borrower and the Servicer shall not deposit or otherwise 
credit, and shall not permit any other Person to deposit or otherwise 
credit to such new depositary account any cash or payment item other than 
Collections. (c) The Servicer shall administer the Collections in 
accordance with the procedures described herein and in Article III. The 
Servicer shall set aside and hold in trust for 30 the account of Borrower 
and the Lenders their respective shares of the Collections in accordance 
with Article III. The Servicer shall, upon the request of the 
Administrative Agent, segregate, in a manner acceptable to the 
Administrative Agent, all cash, checks and other instruments received by it 
from time to time constituting Collections from the general funds of the 
Servicer or Borrower prior to the remittance thereof in accordance with 
Article III. If the Servicer shall be required to segregate Collections 
pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Servicer shall segregate and 
deposit with a bank designated by the Administrative Agent such allocable 
share of Collections of Receivables set aside for the Lenders on the first 
Business Day following receipt by the Servicer of such Collections, duly 
endorsed or with duly executed instruments of transfer. (d) The Servicer 
may, in accordance with the Credit and Collection Policy, extend the 
maturity of any Receivable or adjust the Outstanding Balance of any 
Receivable as the Servicer determines to be appropriate to maximize 
Collections thereof; provided, however, that such extension or adjustment 
shall not alter the status of such Receivable as a Delinquent Receivable or 
Defaulted Receivable or limit the rights of the Administrative Agent or the 
Lenders under this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary 
contained herein, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an 
Amortization Event the Administrative Agent shall have the absolute and 
unlimited right to direct the Servicer to commence or settle any legal 
action with respect to any Receivable or to foreclose upon or repossess any 
Related Security. (e) The Servicer shall hold in trust for Borrower and the 
Lenders all Records that (i) evidence or relate to the Receivables, the 
related Contracts and Related Security or (ii) are otherwise necessary or 
desirable to collect the Receivables and shall, as soon as practicable 
after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Amortization Event 
and upon demand of the Administrative Agent, deliver or make available to 
the Administrative Agent all such Records, at a place selected by the 
Administrative Agent. The Servicer shall, as soon as practicable following 
receipt thereof turn over to applicable Originator any cash collections or 
other cash proceeds received with respect to Indebtedness not constituting 
Receivables. The Servicer shall, from time to time at the request of any 
Lender, furnish to the Lenders (promptly after any such request) a 
calculation of the amounts set aside for the Lenders pursuant to Article 
III. (f) Any payment by an Obligor in respect of any indebtedness owed by 
it to any Originator or Borrower shall, except as otherwise specified by 
such Obligor or otherwise required by contract or law and unless otherwise 
instructed by the Administrative Agent, be applied as a Collection of any 
Receivable of such Obligor (starting with the oldest such Receivable) to 
the extent of any amounts then due and payable thereunder before being 
applied to any other receivable or other obligation of such Obligor. 
Section 8.3 Rights of Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent is 
authorized at any time to date and to deliver to the Collection Banks the 
Collection Notices. Borrower hereby transfers, to the fullest extent 
permitted by applicable law, to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of 
the Lenders, effective when the Administrative Agent delivers such notice, 
the exclusive ownership and control of each Lockbox and the Collection 
Accounts. In case any authorized signatory of Borrower whose signature 
appears on a Collection Account Agreement shall cease to have such 
authority before the delivery of such notice, such Collection Notice shall 
nevertheless be valid as if such authority had remained in force. Borrower 
hereby irrevocably 31 constitutes and appoints the Administrative Agent 
with full power of substitution, as Borrower's true and lawful 
attorney-in-fact with full irrevocable power and authority in the place and 
stead of Borrower and in the name of Borrower or in its own name and 
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, grants to Administrative 
Agent the power and right, on behalf of Borrower, without notice or assent 
by Borrower to (i) at any time after delivery of the Collection Notices, 
endorse Borrower's name on checks and other instruments representing 
Collections, (ii) at any time after the occurrence and continuation of an 
Amortization Event, enforce the Receivables, the related Contracts and the 
Related Security, and (iii) at any time after the occurrence and 
continuation of an Amortization Event, take such action as shall be 
necessary or desirable to cause all cash, checks and other instruments 
constituting Collections of Receivables to come into the possession of the 
Administrative Agent rather than Borrower. (a) At any time following the 
designation of a Servicer other than BSX or any of its Affiliates pursuant 
to Section 8.1: (i) the Administrative Agent may direct the Obligors of 
Receivables, or any of them, to pay all amounts payable under any 
Receivable directly to the Administrative Agent (or other Person designated 
by the Administrative Agent). (ii) Borrower shall, at the Administrative 
Agent's request and at Borrower's expense, give notice of the 
Administrative Agent's security interest in the Receivables to each said 
Obligor and direct that payments be made directly to the Administrative 
Agent. (iii) Borrower shall, (A) at the Administrative Agent's request, 
assemble all of the Records and (B) at the request of any Agent or its 
designee exercise or enforce any of their respective rights hereunder, 
under any other Transaction Document, under any Receivable or under any 
Related Security. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, 
Borrower shall upon the request of the Administrative Agent or its 
designee: (A) execute and file such financing or continuation statements, 
or amendments thereto or assignments thereof, and such other instruments or 
notices, as may be necessary or appropriate; and (B) mark its master data 
processing records evidencing such Receivables with such legend. (b) 
Borrower hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent or its designee to file 
one or more financing or continuation statements, and amendments thereto 
and assignments thereof, relative to all or any of the Receivables and the 
Related Security now existing or hereafter arising in the name of Borrower 
without any signature of Borrower. If Borrower fails to perform any of its 
agreements or obligations under this Agreement or any other Transaction 
Document, the Administrative Agent or its designee may (but shall not be 
required to) itself perform, or cause performance of, such agreement or 
obligation, and the expenses of the Administrative Agent or its designee 
incurred in connection therewith shall be payable by Borrower as provided 
herein. 32 Section 8.4 Responsibilities of Borrower. Anything herein to the 
contrary notwithstanding, the exercise by the Administrative Agent and the 
Lenders of their rights hereunder shall not release the Servicer, any 
Originator or Borrower from any of their duties or obligations with respect 
to any Receivables or under the related Contracts. The Agents and the 
Lenders shall have no obligation or liability with respect to any 
Receivables or related Contracts, nor shall any of them be obligated to 
perform the obligations of Borrower or any Originator. Section 8.5 Monthly 
Reports and Other Information. The Servicer shall prepare and forward to 
the Co-Agents (i) on each Monthly Reporting Date, a Monthly Report and an 
electronic file of the data contained therein and (ii) at such times as the 
Administrative Agent shall request, a listing by Obligor of all Receivables 
together with an aging of such Receivables, provided, that, each Co-Agent 
may request that a computation of the Borrowing Base be made from time to 
time on a date that is not a Monthly Reporting Date and the Servicer will 
as soon as practicable comply with such request. Section 8.6 Servicing Fee. 
As compensation for the Servicer's servicing activities on their behalf, 
the Lenders hereby agree to pay the Servicer the Servicing Fee, which fee 
shall be paid in arrears on each Settlement Date and shall be subject to 
the provisions of Section 3.2(d). ARTICLE IX AMORTIZATION EVENTS Section 
9.1 Amortization Events. The occurrence of any one or more of the following 
events shall constitute an "Amortization Event:" (a) Any Loan Party shall 
fail to make any payment or deposit (i) of principal when required to be 
made by it under the Transaction Documents; or (ii) of any other Obligation 
or amount not covered by clause (i) when required to be made by it under 
the Transaction Documents and such failure continues for five (5) 
consecutive days. (b) Any representation, warranty, certification or 
statement made or deemed made by any Loan Party in any Transaction Document 
to which it is a party or in any other document delivered pursuant thereto 
shall prove to have been false or incorrect in any material respect when 
made or deemed made; provided that the materiality threshold in the 
foregoing clause shall not be applicable with respect to any representation 
or warranty which itself is subject to a materiality threshold. (c) Any 
Loan Party shall fail to perform or observe any covenant contained in 
Section 7.2 or 8.5 when due. (d) Except as provided in any other subsection 
or clause of this Section 9.1, any Loan Party shall fail to perform or 
observe any other covenant or agreement contained in any Transaction 
Document, and such failure shall continue for thirty (30) consecutive days 
(e) Failure of Borrower to pay any Indebtedness (other than the 
Obligations) when due or the default by Borrower in the performance of any 
term, provision or condition contained in any agreement under which any 
such Indebtedness was created or is governed, the effect of which is to 
cause, or to permit the holder or holders of such Indebtedness to cause, 
such Indebtedness to become due prior to its stated maturity; or any such 
33 Indebtedness of Borrower shall be declared to be due and payable or 
required to be prepaid (other than by a regularly scheduled payment) prior 
to the date of maturity thereof. (f) Failure of BSX (at any time while it 
is a Loan Party) or any of its Subsidiaries other than Borrower to pay 
Indebtedness in excess of $100,000,000 in aggregate principal amount 
(hereinafter, "Material Indebtedness") when due taking into account any 
applicable grace period; or the default by BSX (at any time while it is a 
Loan Party) or any of its Subsidiaries other than Borrower in the 
performance of any term, provision or condition contained in any agreement 
under which any Material Indebtedness was created or is governed, the 
effect of which is to cause such Material Indebtedness to become due prior 
to its stated maturity; or any Material Indebtedness of BSX (at any time 
while it is a Loan Party) or any of its Subsidiaries other than Borrower 
shall be declared to be due and payable or required to be prepaid (other 
than by a regularly scheduled payment) prior to the date of maturity 
thereof. (g) An Event of Bankruptcy shall occur with respect to any Loan 
Party or any Material Subsidiary of any Loan Party. (h) As at the end of 
any Calculation Period: (i) the three-month rolling average Past Due Ratio 
shall exceed 2.80%, or (ii) the three-month rolling average Dilution Ratio 
shall exceed 4.4% for any other three-month period. (i) A Change of Control 
shall occur. (j) One or more judgments or decrees shall be entered against 
the Servicer or any of its Subsidiaries involving in the aggregate a 
liability (not paid or in excess of the amount recoverable by insurance) of 
$100,000,000 (net of any related tax benefit) or more, and all such 
judgments or decrees shall not have been vacated, discharged, stayed or 
bonded pending appeal within 60 days from the entry thereof, or one or more 
judgments or decrees shall be entered against the Borrower, and all such 
judgments or decrees shall not have been vacated, discharged, stayed or 
bonded pending appeal within 30 days from the entry thereof. (k) The "Sale 
Termination Date" under and as defined in the Receivables Sale Agreement 
shall occur or any Originator shall for any reason cease to transfer, or 
cease to have the legal capacity to transfer, or otherwise be incapable of 
transferring Receivables under the Receivables Sale Agreement. (l) This 
Agreement shall terminate in whole or in part (except in accordance with 
its terms), or shall cease to be effective or to be the legally valid, 
binding and enforceable obligation of Borrower, or the Administrative Agent 
for the benefit of the Secured Parties shall cease to have a valid and 
perfected first priority security interest in the Collateral. (m) On any 
Settlement Date, after giving effect to the turnover of Collections by the 
Servicer on such date and the application thereof to the Obligations in 
accordance with 34 this Agreement, (i) any Group's Loans at any time 
outstanding shall exceed the aggregate amount of such Group's Liquidity 
Banks' Commitments or (ii) the Net Pool Balance shall be less than the sum 
of (A) the Aggregate Principal plus (B) the Required Reserve. (n) The 
Internal Revenue Service shall file notice of a lien pursuant to Section 
6323 of the Code with regard to any of the Collateral and such lien shall 
not have been released within seven (7) days, or the PBGC shall file notice 
of a lien pursuant to Section 4068 of ERISA with regard to any of the 
Collateral and such lien shall not have been released within seven (7) 
days. Section 9.2 Remedies. Upon the occurrence and during the continuation 
of an Amortization Event, the Administrative Agent may, or upon the 
direction of the Required Liquidity Banks shall, take any of the following 
actions: (i) replace the Person then acting as Servicer if the 
Administrative Agent has not already done so, (ii) declare the Amortization 
Date to have occurred, whereupon the Aggregate Commitment shall immediately 
terminate and the Amortization Date shall forthwith occur, all without 
demand, protest or further notice of any kind, all of which are hereby 
expressly waived by each Loan Party; provided, however, that upon the 
occurrence of an Event of Bankruptcy with respect to any Loan Party, the 
Amortization Date shall automatically occur, without demand, protest or any 
notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by each Loan 
Party, (iii) deliver the Collection Notices to the Collection Banks, (iv) 
exercise all rights and remedies of a secured party upon default under the 
UCC and other applicable laws, and (v) notify Obligors of the 
Administrative Agent's security interest in the Receivables and other 
Collateral. The aforementioned rights and remedies shall be without 
limitation, and shall be in addition to all other rights and remedies of 
the Administrative Agent and the Lenders otherwise available under any 
other provision of this Agreement, by operation of law, at equity or 
otherwise, all of which are hereby expressly preserved, including, without 
limitation, all rights and remedies provided under the UCC, all of which 
rights shall be cumulative. ARTICLE X INDEMNIFICATION Section 10.1 
Indemnities. (a) General Indemnity. Without limiting any other rights which 
any such Person may have hereunder or under applicable law, the Borrower 
hereby agrees to indemnify each of the Affected Parties, each of their 
respective Affiliates, and all successors, transferees, participants and 
assigns and all officers, directors, shareholders, controlling persons, 
employees and agents of any of the foregoing (each, an "Indemnified 
Party"), forthwith on demand, from and against any and all damages, losses, 
claims, liabilities and reasonable related out-of-pocket costs and 
expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements (all of 
the foregoing being collectively referred to as "Indemnified Amounts") 
awarded against or incurred by any of them arising out of or relating to 
the Transaction Documents, the Obligations, the Collateral or the actions 
of the Loan Parties excluding, however: (i) Indemnified Amounts to the 
extent determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted 
from bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of such 
Indemnified Party, (ii) taxes imposed by the jurisdiction in which such 
Indemnified Party's principal executive office is located, on or measured 
by the 35 overall net income of such Indemnified Party; and or (iii) 
recourse (except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement) for 
Indemnified Amounts to the extent the same includes losses in respect of 
Receivables that were Eligible Receivables on the date such Receivables 
were purchased by the Borrower which are uncollectible on account of the 
insolvency, bankruptcy or lack of creditworthiness of the related Obligor. 
Without limiting the foregoing, the Borrower shall indemnify each 
Indemnified Party for Indemnified Amounts arising out of or relating to: 
(A) the creation of any Lien on, or transfer by any Loan Party of any 
interest in, the Collateral other than as provided in the Transaction 
Documents; (B) any representation or warranty made by any Originator or 
Loan Party (or any of its officers) under or in connection with any 
Transaction Document, any Monthly Report or any other information or report 
delivered by or on behalf of any Originator or Loan Party pursuant thereto, 
which shall have been false, incorrect or misleading in any respect when 
made or deemed made or delivered, as the case may be; (C) the failure by 
any Loan Party to comply with the terms of any Transaction Document or any 
applicable law, rule or regulation with respect to any Receivable or the 
related Contract and/or Invoice, or the nonconformity of any Receivable or 
the related Contract and/or Invoice with any such applicable law, rule or 
regulation; (D) the failure to vest and maintain vested in the Borrower a 
perfected ownership interest in all Collateral; or the failure to vest and 
maintain vested in the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Secured 
Parties, a valid and perfected first priority security interest in the 
Collateral, free and clear of any other Lien, other than a Lien arising 
solely as a result of an act of one of the Secured Parties, now or at any 
time thereafter; (E) [Intentionally Omitted] (F) any dispute, claim, offset 
or defense of the Obligor to the payment of any Receivable (including, 
without limitation, a defense based on such Receivables or the related 
Contract and/or Invoice not being a legal, valid and binding obligation of 
such Obligor enforceable against it in accordance with its terms), or any 
other claim resulting from the sale of the services related to such 
Receivable or the furnishing or failure to furnish such services (provided 
that this clause (F) shall not be applied to provide credit recourse in 
respect of the portion of the Outstanding Balance of any Receivable which 
has been discharged in the bankruptcy of the Obligor thereon); (G) any 
matter described in Section 3.4; (H) any failure of any Loan Party to 
perform its duties or obligations in accordance with the provisions of this 
Agreement or the other Transaction Documents to which it is a party; 36 
(I) any claim of breach by any Originator or Loan Party of any related 
Contract and/or Invoice with respect to any Receivable; (J) any Tax (but 
not including Taxes upon or measured by net income or net profits or 
franchise Taxes in lieu of net income or net profits Taxes), all interest 
and penalties thereon or with respect thereto, and all out-of-pocket costs 
and expenses, including the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel in 
defending against the same, which may arise by reason of the Administrative 
Agent's security interest in the Collateral; (K) the commingling of 
Collections of Receivables at any time with other funds; (L) any 
investigation, litigation or proceeding related to or arising from this 
Agreement or any other Transaction Document, the transactions contemplated 
hereby or thereby, the use of the proceeds of any Loan, the security 
interest in the Receivables and Related Assets or any other investigation, 
litigation or proceeding relating to the Borrower or any of the Originators 
in which any Indemnified Party becomes involved as a result of any of the 
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby; (M) any products or 
professional liability, personal injury or damage suit, or other similar 
claim arising out of or in connection with merchandise, insurance or 
services that are the subject of any Contract, Invoice or any Receivable; 
(N) any inability to litigate any claim against any Obligor in respect of 
any Receivable as a result of such Obligor being immune from civil and 
commercial law and suit on the grounds of sovereignty or otherwise from any 
legal action, suit or proceeding; (O) the occurrence of any Event of 
Bankruptcy with respect to any Loan Party; or (P) any loss incurred by any 
of the Secured Parties as a result of the inclusion in the Borrowing Base 
of Receivables owing from any single Obligor and its Affiliates who are 
Obligors which causes the aggregate Outstanding Balance of all such 
Receivables to exceed the applicable Obligor Concentration Limit. (b) 
Contest of Tax Claim; After-Tax Basis. If any Indemnified Party shall have 
notice of any attempt to impose or collect any Tax or governmental fee or 
charge for which indemnification will be sought from any Loan Party under 
Section 10.1(a)(J), such Indemnified Party shall give prompt and timely 
notice of such attempt to the Borrower and the Borrower shall have the 
right, at its expense, to participate in any proceedings resisting or 
objecting to the imposition or collection of any such Tax, governmental fee 
or charge. Indemnification hereunder shall be in an amount necessary to 
make the Indemnified Party whole after taking into account any tax 
consequences of the payment of any of the aforesaid taxes or payments of 37 
amounts indemnified against hereunder (including any deduction) and the 
receipt of the indemnity payment provided hereunder or of any refund of any 
such tax previously indemnified hereunder, including the effect of such 
tax, amount indemnified against, deduction or refund on the amount of tax 
measured by net income or profits which is or was payable by the 
Indemnified Party. (c) Contribution. If for any reason the indemnification 
provided above in this Section 10.1 is unavailable to an Indemnified Party 
or is insufficient to hold an Indemnified Party harmless, then the Borrower 
shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party as 
a result of such loss, claim, damage or liability in such proportion as is 
appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits received by such 
Indemnified Party on the one hand and the Borrower on the other hand but 
also the relative fault of such Indemnified Party as well as any other 
relevant equitable considerations. Section 10.2 Indemnities by Servicer. 
(a) Without limiting any other rights which any Indemnified Party may have 
hereunder or under applicable law, the Servicer hereby agrees to indemnify 
each of the Indemnified Parties forthwith on demand, from and against any 
and all Indemnified Amounts awarded against or incurred by any of them 
arising out of or relating to (i) the Servicer's performance of, or failure 
to perform, any of its obligations under or in connection with any 
Transaction Document, (ii) any representation or warranty made by the 
Servicer (or any of its officers) under or in connection with any 
Transaction Document, any Monthly Report or any other information or report 
delivered by or on behalf of the Servicer, which shall have been false, 
incorrect or misleading in any material respect when made or deemed made or 
delivered, as the case may be, (iii) the failure of the Servicer to comply 
with any applicable law, rule or regulation with respect to any Receivable 
or the related Contract and Invoice or (iv) any commingling of any funds by 
the Servicer relating to the Receivables with any of its funds or the funds 
of any other Person. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall any 
Indemnified Party be indemnified from and against any and all (i) 
Indemnified Amounts to the extent determined by a court of competent 
jurisdiction to have resulted from gross negligence or willful misconduct 
on the part of such Indemnified Party, (ii) taxes imposed by the 
jurisdiction in which such Indemnified Party's principal executive office 
is located, on or measured by the overall net income of such Indemnified 
Party; and or (iii) recourse (except as otherwise specifically provided in 
this Agreement) for Indemnified Amounts to the extent the same includes 
losses in respect of Receivables that were Eligible Receivables on the date 
such Receivables were purchased by the Borrower which are uncollectible on 
account of the insolvency, bankruptcy or lack of creditworthiness of the 
related Obligor. (b) If for any reason the indemnification provided above 
in this Section 10.2 (and subject to the exceptions set forth therein) is 
unavailable to an Indemnified Party or is insufficient to hold an 
Indemnified Party harmless, then the Servicer shall contribute to the 
amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party as a result of such loss, 
claim, damage or liability in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect 
not only the relative benefits received by such Indemnified Party on the 
one hand and the Servicer on the other hand but also the relative fault of 
such Indemnified Party as well as any other relevant equitable 
considerations. 38 Section 10.3 Other Costs and Expenses. Borrower shall 
pay to the Affected Parties on demand all reasonable costs and 
out-of-pocket expenses actually incurred in connection with the 
preparation, execution, delivery and administration of this Agreement, the 
transactions contemplated hereby and the other documents to be delivered 
hereunder, including without limitation, the cost of one set of auditors 
for the Conduits auditing the books, records and procedures of Borrower, 
reasonable fees and out-of-pocket expenses of legal counsel for Old Line, 
Old Line Agent and the Administrative Agent actually incurred (which such 
counsel may be employees of Old Line, Old Line Agent or the Administrative 
Agent) with respect thereto and with respect to advising Old Line, Victory, 
the Victory Agent, Old Line Agent and the Administrative Agent as to their 
respective rights and remedies under this Agreement. Borrower shall pay to 
the Administrative Agent on demand any and all reasonable costs and 
expenses of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, if any, including 
reasonable counsel fees and expenses actually incurred in connection with 
the enforcement of this Agreement and the other documents delivered 
hereunder and in connection with any restructuring or workout of this 
Agreement or such documents, or the administration of this Agreement 
following an Amortization Event. Section 10.4 Taxes. Any sales or use tax 
payable in connection with the transactions contemplated herein, and any 
documentary stamp taxes or recording taxes associated with the perfection 
of the Lender's interest in the Receivables and Related Assets. ARTICLE XI 
THE AGENTS Section 11.1 Appointment. (a) With respect to each Group, each 
member of such Group hereby irrevocably designates and appoints its related 
Co-Agent to act in such capacity hereunder and under the other Transaction 
Documents to which such Co-Agent is a party , and authorizes such Co-Agent 
to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of the Transaction 
Documents and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are 
expressly delegated to such Co-Agent by the terms of the Transaction 
Documents, together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental 
thereto. Each of the Lenders and the Co-Agents hereby irrevocably 
designates and appoints Royal Bank of Canada as Administrative Agent 
hereunder and under the Transaction Documents to which the Administrative

action on its behalf under the provisions of the Transaction Documents and 
to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated 
to the Administrative Agent by the terms of the Transaction Documents, 
together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. 
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, 
none of the Agents shall have any duties or responsibilities, except those 
expressly set forth in the Transaction Documents to which it is a party, or 
any fiduciary relationship with any Lender, and no implied covenants, 
functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities on the part 
of such Agent shall be read into any Transaction Document or otherwise 
exist against such Agent. (b) The provisions of this Article XI are solely 
for the benefit of the Agents and the Lenders, and none of the Loan Parties

any of the provisions of this Article XI, except that this Article XI shall 
not affect any obligations which any of the Agents or Lenders may have to 
any of the Loan Parties under the other provisions of this Agreement. (c) 
In performing its functions and duties hereunder, (i) each Co-Agent shall 
act solely as the agent of the members of its related Group and does not 
assume nor shall be deemed to have assumed any obligation or relationship 
of trust or agency with or for any of the Loan Parties or any of their 
respective successors and assigns, and (ii) the Administrative Agent shall 
act solely as the agent of the Secured Parties and does not assume nor 
shall be deemed to have assumed any obligation or relationship of trust or 
agency with or for any of the Loan Parties or any of their respective 
successors and assigns. Section 11.2 Delegation of Duties. Each of the 
Agents may execute any of its duties under the Transaction Documents to 
which it is a party by or through agents or attorneys-in-fact and shall be 
entitled to advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to such

misconduct of any agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by it with 
reasonable care. Section 11.3 Exculpatory Provisions. None of the Agents 
nor any of its directors, officers, agents or employees shall be (i) liable 
to any of the Lenders or other Agents for any action lawfully taken or 
omitted to be taken by it or them or any Person described in Section 11.2 
under or in connection with this Agreement (except for its, their or such 
Person's own bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct), or (ii) 
responsible in any manner to any of the Lenders or other Agents for any 
recitals, statements, representations or warranties made by Borrower 
contained in this Agreement or in any certificate, report, statement or 
other document referred to or provided for in, or received under or in 
connection with, this Agreement or for the value, validity, effectiveness, 
genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other 
document furnished in connection herewith, or for any failure of any of the 
Loan Parties to perform its respective obligations hereunder, or for the 
satisfaction of any condition specified in Article V, except receipt of 
items required to be delivered to such Agent. None of the Agents shall be 
under any obligation to any other Agent or any Lender to ascertain or to 
inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the agreements or 
covenants contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement, or to inspect the 
properties, books or records of the Loan Parties. This Section 11.3 is 
intended solely to govern the relationship between the Agents, on the one 
hand, and the Lenders and their respective Liquidity Banks, on the other. 
Section 11.4 Reliance by Agents. (a) Each of the Agents shall in all cases 
be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any 
note, writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, 
cablegram, telegram, telecopy, telex or teletype message, statement, order 
or other document or conversation believed by it to be genuine and correct 
and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons and 
upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including, without limitation, 
counsel to the Loan Parties), independent accountants and other experts 
selected by such Agent. Each of the Agents shall in all cases be fully 
justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement or 
any other document furnished in connection herewith unless it shall first 
receive such advice or concurrence of such of its Lenders 40 and Liquidity 
Banks, as it shall determine to be appropriate under the relevant 
circumstances, or it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by its 
Constituent Liquidity Banks against any and all liability, cost and expense 
which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any 
such action. (b) Any action taken by any of the Agents in accordance with 
Section 11.4(a) shall be binding upon all of the Agents and the Lenders. 
Section 11.5 Notice of Events of Default. None of the Agents shall be 
deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Amortization 
Event or Unmatured Amortization Event unless such Agent has received notice 
from another Agent, a Lender or a Loan Party referring to this Agreement, 
stating that an Amortization Event or Unmatured Amortization Event has 
occurred hereunder and describing such Amortization Event or Unmatured 
Amortization Event. In the event that any of the Agents receives such a 
notice, it shall promptly give notice thereof to the Lenders and the other 
Agents. The Administrative Agent shall take such action with respect to 
such Amortization Event or Unmatured Amortization Event as shall be 
directed by either of the Co-Agents, provided that the Administrative Agent 
is indemnified to its satisfaction by such Co-Agent and its Constituent 
Liquidity Banks against any and all liability, cost and expense which may 
be incurred by it by reason of taking any such action. Section 11.6 
Non-Reliance on Other Agents and Lenders. Each of the Lenders expressly 
acknowledges that none of the Agents, nor any of the Agents' respective 
officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates has 
made any representations or warranties to it and that no act by any of the 
Agents hereafter taken, including, without limitation, any review of the 
affairs of the Loan Parties, shall be deemed to constitute any 
representation or warranty by such Agent. Each of the Lenders also 
represents and warrants to the Agents and the other Lenders that it has, 
independently and without reliance upon any such Person (or any of their 
Affiliates) and based on such documents and information as it has deemed 
appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the business, 
operations, property, prospects, financial and other conditions and 
creditworthiness of the Loan Parties and made its own decision to enter 
into this Agreement. Each of the Lenders also represents that it will, 
independently and without reliance upon the Agents or any other Liquidity 
Bank or Lender, and based on such documents and information as it shall 
deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, 
appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under this 
Agreement, and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform 
itself as to the business, operations, property, prospects, financial and 
other condition and creditworthiness of the Loan Parties. The Agents, the 
Lenders and their respective Affiliates, shall have no duty or 
responsibility to provide any party to this Agreement with any credit or 
other information concerning the business, operations, property, prospects, 
financial and other condition or creditworthiness of the Loan Parties which 
may come into the possession of such Person or any of its respective 
officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates, 
except that each of the Agents shall promptly distribute to the other 
Agents and the Lenders, copies of financial and other information expressly 
provided to it by any of the Loan Parties pursuant to this Agreement. 
Section 11.7 Indemnification of Agents. Each Liquidity Bank agrees to 
indemnify (a) its applicable Co-Agent, (b) the Administrative Agent, and 
(c) the officers, directors, employees, 41 representatives and agents of 
each of the foregoing (to the extent not reimbursed by the Loan Parties and 
without limiting the obligation of the Loan Parties to do so), ratably in 
accordance with their respective Loans, from and against any and all 
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, 
suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever 
(including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements of 
counsel for such Co-Agent, the Administrative Agent or such Person in 
connection with any investigative, administrative or judicial proceeding 
commenced or threatened, whether or not such Co-Agent or the Administrative 
Agent or such Person shall be designated a party thereto) that may at any 
time be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against such Co-Agent, the 
Administrative Agent or such Person as a result of, or arising out of, or 
in any way related to or by reason of, any of the transactions contemplated 
hereunder or the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or 
any other document furnished in connection herewith (but excluding any such 
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, 
suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting solely from the bad 
faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Co-Agent, the 
Administrative Agent or such Person as finally determined by a court of 
competent jurisdiction). Section 11.8 Agents in their Individual 
Capacities. Each of the Agents in its individual capacity and its 
affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from and generally engage in 
any kind of business with the Loan Parties and their Affiliates as though 
such Agent were not an Agent hereunder. With respect to its Loans, if any, 
pursuant to this Agreement, each of the Agents shall have the same rights 
and powers under this Agreement as any Lender and may exercise the same as 
though it were not an Agent, and the terms "Lender" and "Lenders" shall 
include each of the Agents in their individual capacities. Section 11.9 
Conflict Waivers. (a) RBC acts, or may in the future act: (i) as 
administrative agent for Old Line and certain other Conduits, (ii) as 
issuing and paying agent for the Commercial Paper of Old Line and certain 
other Conduits, (iii) to provide credit or liquidity enhancement for the 
timely payment for the Commercial Paper of Old Line and certain other 
Conduits and (iv) to provide other services from time to time for Old Line 
and certain other Conduits (collectively, the "RBC Roles"). Without 
limiting the generality of Sections 11.1 and 11.8, each of the 
Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereby acknowledges and consents to 
any and all RBC Roles and agrees that in connection with any RBC Role, RBC 
may take, or refrain from taking, any action which it, in its discretion, 
deems appropriate, including, without limitation, in its role as 
administrative agent for Old Line or such other Conduits, the giving of 
notice to the Liquidity Banks of a mandatory purchase pursuant to a 
Liquidity Agreement, and hereby acknowledges that neither RBC nor any of 
its Affiliates has any fiduciary duties hereunder to any Lender (other than 
Old Line or such other Conduits) arising out of any RBC Roles. (b) BTMU 
acts, or may in the future act: (i) as administrator of Victory, (ii) to 
provide credit or liquidity enhancement for the timely payment for 
Victory's Commercial Paper and (iii) to provide other services from time to 
time for Victory (collectively, the "BTMU Roles"). Without limiting the 
generality of Sections 11.1 and 11.8, each of the Agents and Victory hereby 
acknowledges and consents to any and all BTMU Roles and agrees that in 
connection with any BTMU Role, BTMU may take, or refrain from taking, any 
action which it, 42 in its discretion, deems appropriate, including, 
without limitation, in its role as administrator of Victory, the giving of 
notice to the Victory Liquidity Banks of a mandatory purchase pursuant to 
the Victory Liquidity Agreement.. Section 11.10 UCC Filings. Each of the 
Secured Parties hereby expressly recognizes and agrees that the 
Administrative Agent may be listed as the assignee or secured party of 
record on the various UCC filings required to be made under the Transaction 
Documents in order to perfect their respective interests in the Collateral, 
that such listing shall be for administrative convenience only in creating 
a record or nominee holder to take certain actions hereunder on behalf of 
the Secured Parties and that such listing will not affect in any way the 
status of the Secured Parties as the true parties in interest with respect 
to the Collateral. In addition, such listing shall impose no duties on the 
Administrative Agent other than those expressly and specifically undertaken 
in accordance with this Article XI. ARTICLE XII ASSIGNMENTS; PARTICIPATIONS 
Section 12.1 Restrictions on Assignments. (a) Except to the extent 
permitted by the Transaction Documents, no Loan Party may assign its 
rights, or delegate its duties hereunder or any interest herein without the 
prior written consent of each of the Agents. (b) Each of the Conduits may, 
at any time, assign all or any portion of any of its Loans, or sell 
participations therein, to (i) its Constituent Liquidity Banks or the 
Enhancement Providers (or to its Co-Agent for the ratable benefit of its 
Constituent Liquidity Banks) or (ii) another multi-seller commercial paper 
conduit administered by either Co-Agent which is rated at least "A-1" by 
S&P and "P-1" by Moody's. (c) In addition to, and not in limitation of, 
assignments and participations described in Section 12.1(b): (i) each of 
the Lenders may assign all or any portion of its Loans and, if applicable, 
its Commitment and Liquidity Commitment, to any Eligible Assignee with the 
prior written consent of (A) Borrower and (B) such Lender's applicable 
Co-Agent, which consents shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; 
provided, however, that no such consent shall be required if such Eligible 
Assignee is already a Liquidity Bank party to this Agreement or if any 
Amortization Event exists and is continuing and the aggregate Liquidity 
Commitments, after giving effect to such assignment, would not be reduced 
solely because of such assignment; (ii) each of the Lenders may, without 
the prior written consent of Borrower or any of the Agents, sell 
participations in all or any portion of their respective rights and 
obligations in, to and under the Transaction Documents and the Obligations 
in accordance with Sections 12.2 and 14.7. (d) Nothing herein shall limit 
the ability of either Conduit to grant a security interest therein to the 
program collateral agent for such Conduit's commercial paper program. 43 
Section 12.2 Rights of Assignees and Participants. (a) Upon the assignment 
by a Lender in accordance with Section 1.2(c) or 12.1(b) or (c), the 
Eligible Assignee(s) receiving such assignment shall have all of the rights 
of such Lender with respect to the Transaction Documents and the 
Obligations (or such portion thereof as has been assigned). (b) In no event 
will the sale of any participation interest in any Lender's or any Eligible 
Assignee's rights under the Transaction Documents or in the Obligations 
relieve the seller of such participation interest of its obligations, if 
any, hereunder or, if applicable, under the Liquidity Agreement to which it 
is a party and such Loan Party shall remain solely responsible for the 
performance of its obligations hereunder and thereunder. No participant 
shall have any right to restrict the approval of or to approve any 
amendment, modification or waiver to the provisions hereof except to the 
extent any such amendment, modification or waiver reduces the amount of 
Advances or the interest rate or fees payable with respect to such 
Advances; provided, however, that to the extent that any Liquidity Funding 
is deemed to be the sale of a participation, the foregoing limitation on 
participants' voting rights shall not apply to any Liquidity Bank 
participating in such Liquidity Funding. Section 12.3 Terms and Evidence of 
Assignment. Any assignment to any Eligible Assignee(s) pursuant to Section 
1.2(c), 12.1(b) or 12.1(c) shall be upon such terms and conditions as the 
assigning Lender and the applicable Co-Agent, on the one hand, and the 
Eligible Assignee, on the other, may mutually agree, and any assignment 
pursuant to Section 12.1(c) shall be effectuated by the execution of an 
Assignment and Acceptance Agreement. Any assignment made in accordance with 
the terms of this Article XII shall relieve the assigning Lender of its 
obligations, if any, under this Agreement (and, if applicable, the 
Liquidity Agreement to which it is a party) to the extent assigned. 
Following any such assignment, Schedule A, Schedule 14.2 and other relevant 
provisions of this Agreement will be deemed amended or supplemented, as 
appropriate, without further action, by the information contained in the 
applicable Assignment and Acceptance Agreement. ARTICLE XIII SECURITY 
INTEREST Section 13.1 Grant of Security Interest. To secure the due and 
punctual payment of the Obligations, whether now or hereafter existing, due 
or to become due, direct or indirect, or absolute or contingent, including, 
without limitation, all Indemnified Amounts, in each case pro rata 
according to the respective amounts thereof, Borrower hereby grants to the 
Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Secured Parties, a security 
interest in, all of Borrower's right, title and interest, whether now owned 
and existing or hereafter arising in and to all of the Receivables, the 
Related Security, the Collections and all proceeds of the foregoing 
(collectively, the "Collateral"). Section 13.2 Termination after Final 
Payout Date. Each of the Secured Parties hereby authorizes the 
Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent hereby agrees, promptly 
after the Final Payout Date to execute and deliver to Borrower such UCC 
termination statements as may be necessary to terminate the Administrative 
Agent's security interest in and Lien upon the 44 Collateral, all at 
Borrower's expense. Upon the Final Payout Date, all right, title and 
interest of the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties in and 
to the Collateral shall terminate. ARTICLE XIV MISCELLANEOUS Section 14.1 
Waivers and Amendments. No amendment or waiver of any provision of this 
Agreement nor consent to any departure by any Loan Party therefrom shall in 
any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by 
each of the Loan Parties and the Agents, and any such waiver or consent 
shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific 
purpose for which given; provided, however, that: (a) without the prior 
written consent of all its respective Liquidity Banks, such Co-Agent will 
not amend, modify or waive any provision of this Agreement which would (i) 
reduce the amount of any principal or interest that is payable on account 
of its Group's Loans or delay any scheduled date for payment thereof; (ii) 
decrease the Required Reserve, decrease the spread included in any Interest 
Rate or change the Servicing Fee; (iii) modify this Section 14.1; or (iv) 
modify any yield protection or indemnity provision which expressly inures 
to the benefit of assignees or participants of such Co-Agent's Group. (b) 
Borrower shall not amend or otherwise modify any other Transaction Document 
without the consent of each Agent. (c) No failure on the part of any Agent, 
any Affected Party, any Indemnified Party, Purchaser or any other Secured 
Party to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy 
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or 
partial exercise of any right, power or remedy hereunder preclude any other 
or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or 
remedy. The rights and remedies herein provided are cumulative and not 
exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law. Any waiver of this 
Agreement shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the 
specific purpose for which given. Without limiting the foregoing, BTMU, 
individually and as a Co-Agent, and Victory's Liquidity Provider and 
Enhancement Provider are each hereby authorized by Borrower and Servicer 
(as Servicer and as an Originator) at any time and from time to time, to 
the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all 
deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any 
time held and other indebtedness at any time owing by BTMU, or to Victory's 
Liquidity Provider or Enhancement Provider to or for the credit to the 
account of Borrower or any Originator, now or hereafter existing under this 
Agreement, to of any Agent, any Affected Party, any Indemnified Party, 
Purchaser or any other Secured Party, or their respective successors and 
assigns. Section 14.2 Notices. Except as provided in this Section 14.2, all 
communications and notices provided for hereunder shall be in writing 
(including bank wire, telecopy or electronic facsimile transmission or 
similar writing) and shall be given to the other parties hereto at their 
respective addresses or telecopy numbers set forth on Schedule 14.2 hereof 
or at such other address or telecopy number as such Person may hereafter 
specify for the purpose of notice to each of the other parties hereto. Each 
such notice or other communication shall be effective (i) if given by 
telecopy, upon the receipt thereof, (ii) if given by mail, three (3) 
Business Days after 45 the time such communication is deposited in the mail 
with first class postage prepaid or (iii) if given by any other means, when 
received at the address specified below its signature hereto. Borrower 
hereby authorizes each of the Co-Agents to effect Advances based on 
telephonic notices made by any Person whom such Co-Agent in good faith 
believes to be acting on behalf of Borrower. Borrower agrees to deliver 
promptly to the Co-Agents a written confirmation of each telephonic notice 
signed by an authorized officer of Borrower; provided, however, the absence 
of such confirmation shall not affect the validity of such notice. If the 
written confirmation differs from the action taken by the Co-Agents, the 
records of the Co-Agents shall govern absent manifest error. Section 14.3 
Ratable Payments. Except as provided in the next sentence, if any Lender, 
whether by setoff or otherwise, has payment made to it with respect to any 
portion of the Obligations owing to such Lender (other than payments 
received pursuant to Section 10.2 or 10.3) in a greater proportion than 
that received by any other Lender entitled to receive a ratable share of 
such Obligations, such Lender agrees, promptly upon demand, to purchase for 
cash without recourse or warranty a portion of such Obligations held by the 
other Lenders so that after such purchase each Lender will hold its ratable 
proportion of such Obligations; provided that if all or any portion of such 
excess amount is thereafter recovered from such Lender, such purchase shall 
be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such 
recovery, but without interest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the 
Liquidity Banks in one of the Groups decline to extend their Liquidity 
Termination Date, their Co-Agent will promptly notify the other Co-Agent 
and Borrower of such decision, and Borrower shall have the right to replace 
the non-extending Group with a new Conduit and one or more new Liquidity 
Banks without repaying any portion of the other Group's Loans at the time 
of such replacement, and without triggering the purchase requirements under 
the preceding sentence. Section 14.4 Protection of Administrative Agent's 
Security Interest. (a) Borrower agrees that from time to time, at its 
expense, it will promptly execute and deliver all instruments and 
documents, and take all actions, that may be necessary or desirable, to 
perfect, protect or more fully evidence the Administrative Agent's security 
interest in the Collateral, or to enable the Administrative Agent or the 
Lenders to exercise and enforce their rights and remedies hereunder. At any 
time after the occurrence and continuation of an Amortization Event, the 
Administrative Agent may, or the Administrative Agent may direct Borrower 
or the Servicer to, notify the Obligors of Receivables, at Borrower's 
expense, of the ownership or security interests of the Lenders under this 
Agreement and may also direct that payments of all amounts due or that 
become due under any or all Receivables be made directly to the 
Administrative Agent or its designee. Borrower or the Servicer (as 
applicable) shall, at any Lender's request, withhold the identity of such 
Lender in any such notification. (b) If any Loan Party fails to perform any 
of its obligations hereunder, the Administrative Agent or any Lender may 
(but shall not be required to) perform, or cause performance of, such 
obligations, and the Administrative Agent's or such Lender's reasonable 
costs and expenses incurred in connection therewith shall be payable by 
Borrower as provided in Section 10.3. Each Loan Party irrevocably 
authorizes the Administrative Agent at any time and from time to time in 
the sole discretion of the Administrative Agent, and appoints the 
Administrative Agent as its attorney-in-fact, to act on behalf of such Loan 
Party (i) to execute on 46 behalf of Borrower as debtor and to file 
financing statements necessary or desirable in the Administrative Agent's 
sole discretion to perfect and to maintain the perfection and priority of 
the interest of the Lenders in the Receivables and (ii) to file a carbon, 
photographic or other reproduction of this Agreement or any financing 
statement with respect to the Receivables as a financing statement in such 
offices as the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion deems necessary 
or desirable to perfect and to maintain the perfection and priority of the 
Administrative Agent's security interest in the Collateral, for the benefit 
of the Secured Parties. This appointment is coupled with an interest and is 
irrevocable. Each of the Loan Parties (A) hereby authorizes the 
Administrative Agent to file financing statements and other filing or 
recording documents with respect to the Receivables and Related Security 
(including any amendments thereto, or continuation or termination 
statements thereof), without the signature or other authorization of such 
Loan Party, in such form and in such offices as the Administrative Agent 
reasonably determines appropriate to perfect or maintain the perfection of 
the security interest of the Administrative Agent hereunder, (B) 
acknowledges and agrees that it is not authorized to, and will not, file 
financing statements or other filing or recording documents with respect to 
the Receivables or Related Security (including any amendments thereto, or 
continuation or termination statements thereof), without the express prior 
written approval by the Administrative Agent, consenting to the form and 
substance of such filing or recording document, and approves, authorizes 
and ratifies any filings or recordings made by or on behalf of the 
Administrative Agent in connection with the perfection of the security 
interests in favor of Borrower or the Administrative Agent. Section 14.5 
Confidentiality. (a) Each Loan Party and each Lender shall maintain and 
shall cause each of its employees and officers to maintain the 
confidentiality of this Agreement, the Amended Fee Letters and the other 
confidential or proprietary information that are clearly marked as being 
confidential and/or proprietary with respect to any Agent or any Conduit 
and their respective businesses obtained by it or them in connection with 
the structuring, negotiating and execution of the transactions contemplated 
herein, except that such Loan Party and such Lender and its officers and 
employees may disclose such information to such Loan Party's and such 
Lender's external accountants and attorneys and as required by any 
applicable law or order of any judicial or administrative proceeding. (b) 
Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, each Loan Party hereby 
consents to the disclosure of any nonpublic information with respect to it 
(i ) to any Agent, the Liquidity Banks, any Conduit, any equity provider to 
any Conduit and any credit enhancer of any Conduit (but in accordance with 
the customary practices of the disclosing parties), by each other, (ii) by 
any Agent, any Lender or any credit enhancer of any Conduit to any 
prospective or actual assignee or participant of any of them (but in 
accordance with the customary practices of the disclosing parties), and 
(iii) by any Agent or any credit enhancer of any Conduit to any rating 
agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of a surety, guaranty or credit 
or liquidity enhancement to any Conduit, any credit enhancer of any Conduit 
(but in accordance with the customary practices of the disclosing parties) 
or any entity organized for the purpose of purchasing, or making loans 
secured by, financial assets for which any Agent acts as the administrative 
agent and to any officers, directors, employees, investors, potential 
investors, outside accountants and attorneys and other advisors of any of 
the foregoing if they agree to hold 47 such information confidential (it 
being understood that in the case of any disclosure to investors, potential 
investors and any advisors of the foregoing, such disclosure will be in 
accordance with the customary practices of the disclosing party and will 
not identify any Originator or any Affiliate thereof by name), provided 
that, in each case, each such Person is informed of the confidential nature 
of such information and agrees in writing to maintain the confidential 
nature of such information. In addition, the Lenders, the Agents and any 
credit enhancer of any Conduit may disclose any such nonpublic information 
pursuant to any law, rule, regulation, direction, request or order of any 
judicial, administrative or regulatory authority or proceedings (whether or 
not having the force or effect of law); provided that the Lenders, the 
Agents and any such credit enhancer shall promptly notify the applicable 
Loan Party of any such disclosure, except if such disclosure is in relation 
to (A) a routine audit or review by state or Federal authority or examiner 
or (B) routine periodic reporting to such state or Federal authorities or 
examiners in the normal course of business. Notwithstanding anything to the 
contrary contained in this Agreement or any other Transaction Document, 
each party hereto may disclose to any and all Persons the tax treatment and 
tax structure of the transactions entered into pursuant to this Agreement 
and the other Transaction Documents other than any information for which 
nondisclosure is reasonably necessary in order to comply with applicable 
securities laws. Section 14.6 Bankruptcy Petition; Limitation on Payments. 
(a) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each of the Loan 
Parties, Agents and Lenders hereby covenants and agrees that, prior to the 
date that is one year and one day after the payment in full of all 
outstanding senior indebtedness of any Conduit, it will not institute 
against, or join any other Person in instituting against, such Conduit any 
bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation 
proceedings or other similar proceeding under the laws of the United States 
or any state of the United States. (b) A Conduit shall be required to make 
payment of the amounts required to be paid by it pursuant hereto only if 
the applicable Conduit has Excess Funds (as defined below). If the 
applicable Conduit does not have Excess Funds, the excess of the amount due 
hereunder over the amount paid shall not constitute a "claim" (as defined 
in Section 101(5) of the federal Bankruptcy Code) against such Conduit 
until such time as such Conduit has Excess Funds. If a Conduit does not 
have sufficient Excess Funds to make any payment due hereunder, then such 
Conduit may pay a lesser amount and make additional payments that in the 
aggregate equal the amount of the deficiency as soon as possible 
thereafter. The term "Excess Funds" means the excess of (A) the aggregate 
projected value of the applicable Conduit's assets and other property 
(including cash and cash equivalents), over (B) the sum of (i) the sum of 
all scheduled payments of principal, interest and other amounts payable on 
publicly or privately placed indebtedness of such Conduit for borrowed 
money, plus (ii) the sum of all other liabilities, indebtedness and other 
obligations of such Conduit for borrowed money or owed to any credit or 
liquidity provider, together with all unpaid interest then accrued thereon, 
plus (iii) all taxes payable by such Conduit to the Internal Revenue 
Service, plus (iv) all other indebtedness, liabilities and obligations of 
such Conduit then due and payable, but the amount of any liability, 
indebtedness or obligation of such Conduit shall not exceed the projected 
value of the assets to which recourse for such liability, indebtedness or 
obligation is limited. Excess Funds shall be calculated once each Business 
Day. Except with respect to (and to the extent of) Excess Funds, no 
recourse shall 48 be had for the payment of any amount owing in respect of 
this Agreement or for the payment of any fee hereunder or for any other

representations and warranties contained in Sections 6.1(n), (o) and (r) is
