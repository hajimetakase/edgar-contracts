Series Payment Account to be further distributed pursuant to Section 
6.03(a). On the first Payment Date to occur after the Maturity Date with

such amounts are required to be disbursed in accordance with Section 2.05, 
to the extent such cash and other items are held for the benefit of Series 
2010-1, shall be deposited into the Series Investment Proceeds Account; 
provided, that,

18

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

notwithstanding any provisions in the Agreement or this Supplement, amounts 
on deposit in the Series Holdback Account shall remain uninvested. On each 
Payment Date, the amount of such Investment Proceeds received during the 
immediately preceding Collection Period shall be distributed in the 
following order of priority: (i) to the Persons set forth in clauses (i), 
(ii) and (iv) of Section 6.03(a) (and in the order of such clauses (i),

Account exist to pay the amounts owing to such Persons on such Payment 
Date; and (ii) to the Issuer.

          SECTION 6.03 Distributions. (a) On each Payment Date, the Paying

of Section 6.02(b) governing the distribution of such funds), in payment of 
the following amounts in the following order of priority:

                    c) to the Back-up Servicer, the Back-up Servicing Fee 
in respect of the immediately preceding Collection Period.

               (ii) to the Series 2010-1 Noteholders (pro rata in 
accordance with the Commitment Percentages), an amount equal to the 
Interest Distribution Amount;

               (iii) prior to the date on which all Series 2010-1 Notes 
have been irrevocably paid in full, to the Series Reserve Account to the 
extent such funds are required to increase the balance thereof to the 
Specified Series Reserve Balance;

               (iv) to the Master Servicer (if an Affiliated Entity), the 
Master Servicing Fee in respect of the immediately preceding Collection 
Period (excluding that portion thereof, if any, constituting an Excess 
Master Servicing Fee);

               (v) unless (a) the Collateral Trustee shall have received 
written notice of the occurrence of any OC Shortfall (which notice shall 
include receipt by the Collateral Trustee of any Daily Report, Monthly 
Report or other report evidencing any OC Shortfall) or (b) there has 
occurred any Event of Default which is continuing, to the Issuer Interest 
Holders, pari passu, the Issuer Return Amount in respect of the immediately 
preceding Collection Period; provided, however, that, notwithstanding 
clause (a), if, subsequent to the occurrence of any OC Shortfall, three 
consecutive Collection Periods immediately preceding such Payment Date 
shall have elapsed during which no subsequent OC Shortfall of any kind 
shall have

19

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

occurred, the Issuer Return Amount accrued and unpaid during such three 
Collection Periods (except for any such amount that would not have been 
available to be paid on any related Payment Date due to insufficient funds) 
shall be paid to the Issuer Interest Holders, pari passu, out of remaining 
funds;

               (vi) following the termination of the Series 2010-1 
Revolving Period or the receipt by the Collateral Trustee of written notice 
of the occurrence of any OC Shortfall (unless such OC Shortfall shall have 
been cured in accordance with the proviso of clause (v) above), to the 
Series 2010-1 Noteholders (pro rata in accordance with the Commitment 
Percentages), in respect of principal of the Series 2010-1 Notes, an amount 
equal to the principal balance of the Series 2010-1 Notes until such time 
as the principal is fully repaid;

               (vii) ratably to the Master Servicer, the Back-up Servicer, 
the Trustee, the Collateral Trustee, and the Series 2010-1 Noteholders, any 
and all other amounts then owing to such Persons; and

               (viii) to the Issuer Interest Holders, pari passu, all 
remaining amounts available for distribution on such date after payment in 
full of items (i) through (vii) above.

          (b) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary herein, if at 
any time after any payment to any Series 2010-1 Noteholder, the Trustee, 
the Master Servicer (if other than an Affiliated Entity), the Collateral 
Trustee or the Back-up Servicer is made pursuant to this Section 6.03, such 
payment is rescinded or must otherwise be returned for any reason, 
effective upon such rescission or return, such payment shall automatically 
be deemed, as between such Series 2010-1 Noteholder, the Trustee, the 
Master Servicer, the Collateral Trustee or the Back-up Servicer, as the 
case may be, and the Issuer and the Master Servicer (if an Affiliated 
Entity), never to have occurred, and the Issuer and/or the Master Servicer 
shall be required, to the extent it received any amounts under this 
Section 6.03 of a lower priority than such rescinded or returned payment, 
to pay to the Person from whom such returned or rescinded payment was 
recovered, an amount equal to such rescinded or returned payment.

          (c) Except as provided in the final sentence of this paragraph 
with respect to holders of beneficial interests in Global Notes, 
distributions to Series 2010-1 Noteholders and Issuer Interest Holders 
hereunder shall be made by wire transfer to each Series 2010-1 Noteholder 
or Issuer Interest Holder, as applicable, to such account as may be 
designated in writing by each such Person and received by the Paying Agent 
at least fifteen (15) Business Days prior to the applicable Payment Date 
(the Record Date), without presentation or surrender of any Series 2010-1 
Note or the making of any notation thereon; provided, however, that any 
such distribution not so timely paid to any Series 2010-1 Noteholder on the 
applicable Payment Date shall cease to be payable to the Series 2010-1 
Noteholders as of the close of business on the Record Date and shall be 
payable to the Series 2010-1 Noteholders as of the close of business on a 
special record date (a Special Record Date) for the payment of any such 
defaulted amount. Such Special Record Date shall be fixed by the Paying 
Agent whenever moneys become available for payment of the defaulted amount, 
and notice of such Special Record Date shall be given to the Series 2010-1 
Noteholders not less than ten days prior thereto by first-class mail to 
each such Series 2010-1 Noteholder as shown in the Note Register on the 
date selected by the Paying Agent, stating the date of the Special Record 
Date and the date fixed for the payment of

20

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

such defaulted amount. Any designation by a Series 2010-1 Noteholder or an 
Issuer Interest Holder of an account for receipt of wire transfers pursuant 
to the preceding sentence may be a standing instruction, effective with 
respect to the applicable Payment Date and each Payment Date thereafter 
until revoked. In the absence of such timely wire transfer instructions, 
payment will be made by check to the address of record of the Series 2010-1 
Noteholder or Issuer Interest Holder, as applicable. All other payments 
will be made in accordance with the Agreement or as otherwise may be agreed 
upon by the Paying Agent and such other Person entitled to payment thereon. 
Distributions to holders of beneficial interests in Global Notes shall be 
made pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and this Supplement, including, 
without limitation, Section 6.11 of the Agreement.

          SECTION 6.04 Series Holdback Account. On the Closing Date and on 
each Advance Date, out of the proceeds received from the initial sale of 
the Series 2010-1 Notes and from each Advance, the Issuer and/or the Master 
Servicer shall instruct the Collateral Trustee, prior to making any 
payments thereof to the Issuer, to deposit to the Series Holdback Account 
funds in an amount equal to the sum of the Closing Date Holdback Amounts 
for all Series Holdback Receivables that become Series Trust Assets on the 
Closing Date or such Advance Date minus the amount of funds deposited to 
the Series Holdback Account by or on behalf of the Issuer on or prior to 
the Closing Date or Advance Date, as applicable, and remaining on deposit 
at such time.

          SECTION 6.05 Master Servicer Obligations Relating to Holdback 
Funds. Consistent with the servicing standards set forth in Article III of 
the Agreement, the Master Servicer shall administer the distribution of all 
Holdback Funds in respect of Series Receivables. Without limiting the 
generality of the foregoing, the Master Servicer shall perform each of the 
following obligations:

          (a) If an Initial Scheduled Payment with respect to any Series 
Holdback Receivable is remitted to a Lock-Box or the Master Collection 
Account by the third Business Day after the due date therefor (the 
Holdback Cut-off Date), the Master Servicer (or, after the occurrence and 
during the continuance of a Servicer Default, the Collateral Trustee at the 
direction of the Master Servicer) shall cause funds to be withdrawn from 
the Series Holdback Account in an amount equal to the Adjusted Holdback 
Amount in respect of such Receivable as of the related Holdback Cut-off 
Date and shall remit such amount to the applicable Claimant by not later 
than the fifth Business Day after such Holdback Cut-off Date (any such 
payment, a Holdback Release Payment).

          (b) If any Initial Scheduled Payment with respect to any Series 
Holdback Receivable is not remitted to a Lock-Box or the Master Collection 
Account by the Holdback Cut-off Date, the Master Servicer (or, during the 
continuance of a Servicer Default, the Collateral Trustee at the direction 
of the Master Servicer) shall cause funds to be withdrawn from the Series 
Holdback Account in an amount equal to such Initial Scheduled Payment and 
shall remit such amount to the Series Collection Account by not later than 
the fifth Business Day after such Holdback Cut-off Date (any such payment, 
a Holdback Replacement Payment).

21

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

          (c) If, subsequent to the date any Holdback Replacement Payment 
is remitted to the Series Collection Account, the related Initial Scheduled 
Payment in respect of such Holdback Replacement Payment is deposited into 
the Series Collection Account (any such payment, a Late Initial Scheduled 
Payment), the Master Servicer (or, during the continuance of a Servicer 
Default, the Collateral Trustee at the direction of the Master Servicer) 
shall cause funds to be withdrawn from the Series Collection Account in an 
amount equal to such Late Initial Scheduled Payment by the following 
Business Day and shall remit such amount to the applicable Claimant by not 
later than the fifth Business Day after the day such payment was deposited 
into the Series Collection Account.

pursuant to Section 6.03, (i) there shall be a failure to pay in full on 
any Payment Date the Interest Distribution Amount for such Payment Date or 
(ii) the Aggregate Principal Balance of the Series 2010-1 Notes shall not 
have been repaid in full on or prior to the Legal Maturity Date (a Series 
Event of Default pursuant to this Section 7.01(a), a Specified Payment

          (b) any failure by the Issuer, the Master Servicer or the Seller 
to make any payment (other than as set forth in clause (a)), transfer or 
deposit or remit any funds, or, if applicable, to give instructions or 
notice to the Trustee or the Collateral Trustee to make such payment, 
transfer or deposit or remit any funds, in each case, when required to do 
so and (i) such failure involves a payment, transfer, deposit or remittance 
(or an instruction in respect thereof) which constitutes, or but for such 
failure would constitute, Collections with respect to Series 2010-1 or 
other Series Trust Assets with respect to Series 2010-1, and (ii) such 
failure remains unremedied for five (5) Business Days after the Issuer, the 
Master Servicer or the Seller was required to make such payment, deposit or 
remittance or give such instruction;

          (c) any failure by the Issuer or the Seller duly to observe or 
perform in any respect any other covenant or agreement of such Person set 
forth in any of the Agreement (if such failure affects Series 2010-1), this 
Supplement, the Issuer Purchase Agreement, any other Operative Document 
relating to Series 2010-1 or any other instrument, agreement or document 
related to Series 2010-1 or to any of the foregoing, which failure (x) has, 
or could reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect and (y) 
continues unremedied for thirty (30) days after the earlier of (i) the date 
upon which a Responsible Officer of such breaching party obtained actual 
knowledge of such failure and (ii) the date upon which written notice of 
such failure shall have been given to such breaching party by the Trustee, 
any Series 2010-1 Noteholder, the Master Servicer, the Collateral Trustee, 
the Control Party or any other Person;

          (d) any representation, warranty or certification made or deemed 
to have been made by the Issuer or the Seller under or in connection with 
the Agreement (if such representation or warranty relates to Series 
2010-1), this Supplement, the Issuer Purchaser

22

Agreement, any other Operative Document relating to Series 2010-1 or any 
other instrument, agreement or document related to Series 2010-1 or to any 
of the foregoing, or in any certificate or information delivered pursuant 
to or in connection with any of the foregoing or in connection with any of 
the opinions of counsel delivered on the Closing Date, shall, in any event, 
prove to have been incorrect when made or deemed to have been made, and 
such incorrectness (x) has, or could reasonably be expected to have, a 
Material Adverse Effect and (y) continues unremedied for thirty (30) days 
after the earlier of (i) the date upon which a Responsible Officer of such 
breaching party obtained actual knowledge of such incorrectness and (ii) 
the date upon which written notice of such failure shall have been given to 
such breaching party by the Trustee, any Series 2010-1 Noteholder, the 
Master Servicer, the Collateral Trustee, the Control Party or any other 
Person; provided, however, that to the extent that any such untrue 
representation relates to a Series Receivable, it shall not constitute a 
Series Event of Default hereunder to the extent the Issuer causes the 
Seller to repurchase or substitute such Series Receivable as required 
pursuant to Section 2.04(s) of the Agreement and the Seller shall so 
repurchase and substitute such Series Receivables as required therein;

          (e) the Trustee shall cease to have, a valid, perfected and 
continuing first priority security interest (as defined in the UCC of the 
jurisdiction the law of which governs the perfection of the interest in the 
Series Trust Assets created under this Supplement) in the Series Trust 
Assets for Series 2010-1 (other than any Released Series Trust Assets) now 
existing and hereafter arising and the proceeds thereof free and clear of 
any Liens other than Permitted Liens; provided, that, if such affected 
Series Trust Assets constitute 3% or less of the Aggregate Discounted 
Receivables Balance of all of the Series Trust Assets, then such 
circumstance shall not constitute a Series Event of Default if, within five 
(5) days after learning of any such circumstance, the Issuer shall cause 
the Seller to repurchase such affected Series Trust Assets from the Issuer 
for a price equal to the Aggregate Discounted Receivables Balance thereof 
(to be paid in cash to the Trustees Account) or to contribute (in exchange 
for such affected Receivables) to the Issuer for inclusion in the Series 
Trust Assets, Eligible Receivables (x) in respect of which such 
circumstance does not exist and (y) having an Aggregate Discounted 
Receivables Balance equal to or in excess of that of the affected 
Receivables; or

          (f) an OC Shortfall Default shall occur;

          (g) any of the Series 2010-1 Notes shall be characterized by the 
Internal Revenue Service as other than indebtedness of the Issuer for 
federal income tax purposes;

          (h) any transfer of Receivables and Related Property (whether 
constituting Series Receivables for Series 2010-1 or otherwise) by the 
Seller to the Issuer on any date shall cease to create a valid sale, 
transfer and/or assignment of all right, title and interest of the Seller 
in, to and under all such Receivables and Related Property;

Servicer pursuant to a contractually binding obligation, at any time, (i) 
the Back-up Servicing Agreement shall cease to be effective and shall not 
have been replaced within sixty (60) days after the date the Back-up 
Servicing Agreement ceases to be effective, such replacement agreement to 
be subject to the prior consent of the Control Party (which consent shall 
not be unreasonably withheld); (ii) the Back-up Servicer shall breach its 
obligations thereunder or the license granted to the Back-up Servicer under 
Section 9.5 of the Back-up Servicing Agreement shall terminate and such 
breach or termination shall remain unremedied for more than thirty (30) 
days after notice thereof has been given to the Back-up Servicer and (with 
respect to termination of the license) the Master Servicer; (iii) the 
Back-up Servicer shall assign any of its obligations to a third party other 
than as permitted under the Back-up Servicing Agreement and the Agreement; 
or (iv) an Insolvency Event shall occur with respect to the Back-up 
Servicer;

          (l) unless a successor Master Servicer that is not an Affiliated 
Entity is first appointed pursuant to the Agreement, fifty percent (50%) or 
more of the voting interests of the Master Servicer shall become owned, 
directly or indirectly, by Persons other than the Persons owning such 
interests on the Closing Date without the prior written approval of the 
Control Party; provided, that such prior written approval shall not be 
required if (i) the long-term unsecured debt rating of the Person acquiring 
fifty percent (50%) or more of the voting interests of the Master Servicer 
is rated not less than BBB- by S&P or Baa3 by Moodys on the date of

collectively hold a larger equity share of such voting interests than any 
other group of affiliated entities or individuals. The Control Party shall 
not unreasonably withhold its approval of any transfer of the voting 
interests in the Master Servicer and shall grant such approval, if at all, 
within fifteen (15) Business Days of the date on which such approval is 
requested and the Control Party is provided with all information reasonably 
requested by it to determine whether or not to provide such consent;

          (n) the Issuer shall make any sale, transfer, assignment or 
pledge of its interest in the Issuer Interest or any portion thereof which 
sale, transfer, assignment or pledge shall result, directly or indirectly, 
in any Person other than the Seller having a right to participate in the 
management of the Issuer, to exercise any voting or other decision-making 
rights as a member of the Issuer, or to be admitted as a substitute member 
or to act as a manager or officer of the Issuer; provided, however, that 
any Issuer Interest Holder other than the Issuer may have the right to 
consent to any action by the Issuer which is solely related to the Issuer 
Interest; or

          (o) any Event of Default shall occur under Section 9.01(a), 
(b) or (c) of the Agreement;

then (i) if other than a Series Event of Default resulting from a Specified 
Insolvency Default, the Trustee in its discretion may, or if so requested 
in writing by the Control Party, shall, in either case, by notice given in 
writing to the Issuer, the Collateral Trustee and the Master Servicer,

24

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

declare that a Series Event of Default has occurred with respect to Series 
2010-1 as of the date of such notice, or (ii) if resulting from a Specified 
Insolvency Default, a Series Event of Default shall have automatically 
occurred without any action of the Control Party or the Trustee.

          Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Agreement, 
the Issuer or the Master Servicer on its behalf shall promptly notify in 
writing the Trustee and the Collateral Trustee of the occurrence of any 
Series Event of Default or any event or circumstance that with the lapse of 
time or the giving of notice or both would constitute such a Series Event 
of Default, which notice shall contain a statement from such Persons chief 
financial officer describing what action the Issuer or the Master Servicer 
intends to take with respect to such occurrence. From and after the 
Acceleration Date, (i) no payments in respect of the Issuer Interest or the 
Issuer Return Amount shall be made until all amounts owed to the Series 
2010-1 Noteholders and the Secured Parties shall have been reduced to zero, 
(ii) the Series 2010-1 Revolving Period shall terminate and the Series 
2010-1 Noteholders Commitments to make any further Advances hereunder 
shall terminate and (iii) the appointment of the Master Servicer may be 
terminated at the election of the Control Party and a person or persons 
satisfactory to the Control Party appointed in its place. All funds 
received from the foreclosure upon and/or sale of the Series Trust Assets 
in accordance with either clause (i) or (ii) of Section 9.02(b) of the 
Agreement shall be applied in accordance with Section 6.03(a) of this 
Supplement.


ARTICLE VIII
MISCELLANEOUS

          SECTION 8.01 Ratification of Agreement; Integration. (a) As 
supplemented by this Supplement, the Agreement is in all respects ratified 
and confirmed and the Agreement, as so supplemented by this Supplement 
shall be read, taken and construed as one and the same instrument.

          (b) This Supplement, the Agreement, the Initial Purchase 
Agreement, the Series 2010-1 Notes, the Back-up Servicing Agreement, and 
the other Operative Documents and other instruments, documents and 
agreements relating to Series 2010-1 or any of the foregoing set forth the 
complete agreement of the parties hereto, thereto and the Holders of the 
Series 2010-1 Notes, and shall be deemed to have incorporated and 
superseded all prior written or oral agreements with respect thereto. Each 
of the Holders of the Series 2010-1 Notes, by its acceptance thereof, 
hereby acknowledges and agrees that prior to its purchase or other 
acquisition of such Series 2010-1 Notes, it has had an opportunity to 
review all of the Operative Documents and has completed such independent 
due diligence as, in each case, it has deemed relevant in making its 
investment decision with respect to Series 2010-1.

          SECTION 8.02 Counterparts. This Supplement may be executed in two 
or more counterparts, each of which, when so executed, shall be deemed to 
be an original, but all of which shall together constitute but one and the 
same instrument.

          SECTION 8.03 Governing Law. THOSE TERMS, CONDITIONS, AND 
PROVISIONS OF THIS SUPPLEMENT RELATING TO THE ATTACHMENT, PERFECTION AND 
ENFORCEMENT OF THE LIENS AND SECURITY INTERESTS IN

25

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

THE SERIES TRUST ASSETS GRANTED BY THE ISSUER IN FAVOR OF THE TRUSTEE SHALL 
BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE INTERNAL LAWS (AS 
OPPOSED TO THE CONFLICT OF LAW PROVISIONS) OF THE STATE OF GEORGIA. ALL 
OTHER TERMS, CONDITIONS AND PROVISIONS OF THIS SUPPLEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED 
BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS (INCLUDING SECTION 5-1401 OF 
THE GENERAL OBLIGATIONS LAW BUT OTHERWISE WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICT OF 
LAW PROVISIONS) OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

          SECTION 8.04 Amendments and Waivers. In addition to the rights 
contained in Section 13.01 of the Agreement:

          (a) unless the consent of each Series 2010-1 Noteholder is 
obtained, it shall be a condition precedent to the effectiveness of any 
amendment to (or waiver in respect of) any Operative Document (other than 
any amendment to cure any ambiguity) that (i) the Control Party shall have 
consented to such amendment or waiver and (ii) the Issuer shall have 
delivered to the Trustee an Officers Certificate to the effect that the 
Issuer reasonably believes that such amendment will not have a Material 
Adverse Effect and is not reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse 
Effect at any time in the future; and

          (b) subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in 
Section 13.01 of the Agreement and the other provisions of this Section 
8.04 with respect to any waiver or amendment of any Operative Document, the 
Trustee is hereby authorized and directed to consent to such amendment or 
waiver to the extent its consent is required by such Operative Document.

No waiver with respect to any term or condition of the Agreement or this 
Supplement shall extend to any subsequent or other event, circumstance or 
default or impair any right consequent thereon except to the extent 
expressly so waived. Without limiting the foregoing, any amendment to or 
waiver of any Event of Default that may be agreed or consented to in 
accordance with this Section 8.04 and Section 13.01 of the Agreement, shall 
not, solely because of any resulting occurrence or non-occurrence of any 
Event of Default and any changes in the priority of distributions of funds 
pursuant to Section 6.03(a) that may result from such occurrence or 
non-occurrence, be deemed to reduce in any manner the amount of, or delay 
the timing of, allocations, payments or distributions within the meaning 
of Section 13.01(b)(i) of the Agreement, and thus such amendment or waiver, 
without more, shall not require the consent of any Series 2010-1 Noteholder 
whose consent would not be required if such amendment or waiver did not 
result in such changes in the priority of distributions. In the case of any 
conflict between this Section 8.04 and Section 13.01 of the Agreement, 
Section 13.01 of the Agreement shall control.

          SECTION 8.05 Limitations on Liability. None of the members, 
managers, officers, employees, agents, stockholders, holders of limited 
liability company interests, officers or directors of or in the Issuer or 
the Master Servicer, past, present or future, shall be under any liability 
to the Trustee, the Series 2010-1 Noteholders or any other Person for any 
action taken or for refraining from the taking of any action in such 
capacities or otherwise pursuant to the

26

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

Agreement or this Supplement or for any obligation or covenant under the 
Agreement or this Supplement, it being understood that, with respect to the 
Issuer, the Agreement and this Supplement and the obligations created 
thereunder and hereunder shall be, to the fullest extent permitted under 
applicable law, solely the limited liability company obligations of the 
Issuer or the Master Servicer, as applicable. The Issuer, the Master 
Servicer and any member, manager, officer, employee, agent, stockholder, 
holder of limited liability company interest, officer or director of or in 
the Issuer or the Master Servicer, as applicable, may rely in good faith on 
any document of any kind prima facie properly executed and submitted by any 
Person (other than the Issuer or any Affiliate thereof, in the case of the 
Issuer, or the Master Servicer or any Affiliate thereof, in the case of the 
Master Servicer) respecting any matters arising hereunder.

          SECTION 8.06 Confidentiality. Except to the extent otherwise 
required by applicable law or as may be necessary to enforce any rights in 
respect of any Operative Document, each Series 2010-1 Noteholder, by its 
acceptance of the Series 2010-1 Notes held by it, agrees to (i) maintain 
the confidentiality of the financial terms of the Operative Documents 
(unless the Issuer shall otherwise consent in writing) and (ii) not 
disclose, deliver or otherwise make available to any third party any 
non-public information regarding the financial condition, the Credit Policy 
Manual, any of the other credit and collection policies and procedures or 
the operations of the Issuer, the Master Servicer or the Seller that such 
Series 2010-1 Noteholder may obtain pursuant to any Operative Document or 
in connection with the transactions contemplated thereby (the information 
described in clauses (i) and (ii) above being referred to herein as the 
Confidential Information); provided, however, that such Series 2010-1 
Noteholder may disclose any Confidential Information and the Operative 
Documents (A) to its directors, officers and employees to the extent 
necessary or desirable in connection with such Holders investment in the 
Series 2010-1 Notes and to its legal counsel, auditors and accountants, 
provided they are made aware of the confidential nature of the information 
and agree to be bound by the provisions hereof, (B) to any rating agency or 
any Governmental Authority, and (C) subject to a written confidentiality 
agreement for the benefit of the Issuer having terms substantially similar 
to this Section 8.06, to any assignee or potential assignee of the Series 
2010-1 Notes held by such Series 2010-1 Noteholder; provided, further, 
however, that such Series 2010-1 Noteholder shall have no obligation of 
confidentiality in respect of any information which may be generally 
available to the public or becomes available to the public through no fault 
of such Series 2010-1 Noteholder or after the occurrence of an Event of 
Default.

          SECTION 8.07 Section Headings. The Section headings contained in 
this Supplement are for convenience only and in no way define, limit or 
describe the scope or intent of any provision or Section of this 
Supplement.

          SECTION 8.08 Notices. Notices hereunder shall be given in the 
manner set forth in the Agreement.

          SECTION 8.09 Benefits of Supplement. This Supplement will inure 
to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto, the Series 2010-1 
Noteholders and their

27

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

respective successors and permitted assigns. Except as otherwise provided 
in this Supplement, no other person will have any right or obligation 
hereunder.

          SECTION 8.10 Additional Covenants of the Master Servicer. The 
Master Servicer shall appoint a replacement Back-up Servicer (which 
successor Back-up Servicer must be consented to by the Control Party) that 
assumes the duties of the Back-up Servicer under the Back-up Servicing 
Agreement within sixty (60) days after the Back-up Servicing Agreement 
shall cease to be effective.

          SECTION 8.11 Additional Covenants of the Issuer. (a) On (i) 
October 15, 2014 (or within ten days after such date) and (ii) on the last 
day of every sixty (60) month period after October 15, 2014 (or within ten 
(10) days after the end of such sixty (60) month period), the Issuer shall 
deliver to the Trustee, the Collateral Trustee and each Series 2010-1 
Noteholder, at the expense of the Issuer, a Opinion of Counsel to the 
Issuer (which counsel may be in-house counsel of the Issuer) either stating 
that, (x) in the opinion of such counsel, such action has been taken with 
respect to the filing of any financing statements and continuation 
statements and any other action that may be required by law as is necessary 
to maintain the perfection of the security interests created (1) by the 
Agreement and (2) under the Issuer Purchase Agreement, and reciting the 
details of such action; or (y) in the opinion of such counsel no such 
action is necessary to maintain the perfection of such security interests. 
Such Opinion of Counsel shall also describe the filing of any financing 
statements and continuation statements that shall, in the opinion of such 
counsel, be required to maintain such security interests until the next 
date on which an Opinion of Counsel is required to be delivered under this 
Section 8.11.

          (b) Upon the written request of the Control Party, the Issuer 
shall use its best efforts to engage a rating agency to rate the Series 
2010-1 Note. Such rating agency shall be one of S&P, Moodys, DBRS or A.M. 
Best, with the choice between such rating agencies to be in the sole 
discretion of the Issuer. The Control Party is hereby obligated to 
reimburse the Issuer for any and all mutually agreed costs and expenses 
incurred by the Issuer in connection with the Issuers effort to obtain 
such a rating, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys fees 
and disbursements.
