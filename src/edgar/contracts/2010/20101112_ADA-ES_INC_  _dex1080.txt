PAYMENT PROCEDURES - REIMBURSEMENT THROUGH THE AUTOMATED CLEARING HOUSE 
(ACH) VENDER INQUIRY PAYMENT ELECTRONIC REPORTING SYSTEM (VIPERS)

a.        Method of Payment. Payment will be made by reimbursement through 
ACH.


b.        Requesting Reimbursement. Requests for reimbursements must be 
made electronically through Department of Energys Oak Ridge Financial 
Service Center (ORFSC) VIPERS. To access and use VIPERS, you must enroll at 
https://finweb.oro.doe.gov/vipers.htm. Detailed instructions on how to 
enroll are provided on the web site.


For non-construction awards, you must submit a Standard Form (SF) 270, 
Request for Advance or Reimbursement at 
https://finweb.oro.doe.gov/vipers.htm and attach a file containing 
appropriate supporting documentation. The file attachment must show the 
total federal share claimed on the SF 270, the non-federal share claimed 
for the billing period if cost sharing is required, and cumulative 
expenditures to date (both Federal and non-Federal) for each of the 
following categories: salaries/wages and fringe benefits; equipment; 
travel; participant/training support costs, if any; other direct costs, 
including subawards/contracts; and indirect costs. For construction awards, 
you must submit a SF 271, Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for 
Construction Programs, through VIPERS.
 
Page 2 of 24

------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
c.        Timing of submittals. Submittal of the SF 270 or SF 271 should 
coincide with your normal billing pattern, but not more frequently than 
every two weeks. Requests for reimbursement must be limited to the amount 
of disbursements made during the billing period for the federal share of 
direct project costs and the proportionate share of any allowable indirect 
costs incurred during that billing period.


d.        Adjusting payment requests for available cash. You must disburse 
any funds that are available from repayments to and interest earned on a 
revolving fund, program income, rebates, refunds, contract settlements, 
audit recoveries, credits, discounts, and interest earned on any of those 
funds before requesting additional cash payments from DOE.


e.        Payments. The DOE approving official will approve the invoice as 
soon as practicable but not later than 30 days after your request is 
received, unless the billing is improper. Upon receipt of an invoice 
payment authorization from the DOE approving official, the ORFSC will 
disburse payment to you. You may check the status of your payments at the 
VIPER web site. All payments are made by electronic funds transfer to the 
bank account identified on the ACH Vendor/Miscellaneous Payment Enrollment 
Form (SF 3881) that you filed.


COST SHARING

a.        Total Estimated Project Cost is the sum of the Government share 
and Recipient share of the estimated project costs. The Recipients cost 
share must come from non-Federal sources unless otherwise allowed by law. 
By accepting federal funds under this award, you agree that you are liable 
for your percentage share of total allowable project costs, on a budget 
period basis, even if the project is terminated early or is not funded to 
its completion. This cost is shared as follows:
 

Budget Period (Start Date)

   	Budget Period 1
(10/01/2010) 	  	  	Budget Period 2
(04/01/2012) 	  	  	Budget Period 3
(10/01/2013) 	  	  	Total Estimated
Cost 	 

 DOE Share

   	$ 	3,099,474/80 	%  	  	$ 	8,803,606/80 	%  	  	$ 	3,096,920/80 	%  	  	
$ 	15,000,000/80 	% 

 Recipient Share

   	$ 	774,869/20 	%  	  	$ 	2,200,901/20 	%  	  	$ 	774,230/20 	%  	  	$ 	
3,750,000/20 	% 
   	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	 

 Total

   	$ 	3,874,343/100 	%  	  	$ 	11,004,507/100 	%  	  	$ 	3,871,150/100 	%  	
  	$ 	18,750,000/100 	% 
   	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	 

 Budget Period Duration in Months

   	  	18 	   	  	  	18 	   	  	  	15 	   	  	 	 	


b.        If you discover that you may be unable to provide cost sharing of 
at least the amount identified in paragraph a of this term, you should 
immediately provide written notification to the DOE Award Administrator 
indicating whether you will continue or phase out the project. If you plan 
to continue the project, the notification must describe how replacement 
cost sharing will be secured.


c.        You must maintain records of all project costs that you claim as 
cost sharing, including in-kind costs, as well as records of costs to be 
paid by DOE. Such records are subject to audit.


d.        Failure to provide the cost sharing required by this term may 
result in the subsequent recovery by DOE of some or all the funds provided 
under the award.


REBUDGETING AND RECOVERY OF INDIRECT COSTS - REIMBURSABLE INDIRECT COSTS 
AND FRINGE BENEFITS

a.        If actual allowable indirect costs are less than those budgeted 
and funded under the award, you may use the difference to pay additional 
allowable direct costs during the project period. If at the completion of 
the award the Governments share of total allowable costs (i.e., direct and 
indirect), is less than the total costs reimbursed, you must refund the 
difference.
 
Page 3 of 24

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 
b.        Recipients are expected to manage their indirect costs. DOE will 
not amend an award solely to provide additional funds for changes in 
indirect cost rates. DOE recognizes that the inability to obtain full 
reimbursement for indirect costs means the recipient must absorb the 
underrecovery. Such underrecovery may be allocated as part of the 
organizations required cost sharing.


USE OF PROGRAM INCOME - ADDITION

If you earn program income during the project period as a result of this 
award, you may add the program income to the funds committed to the award 
and use it to further eligible project objectives.


STATEMENT OF FEDERAL STEWARDSHIP

DOE will exercise normal Federal stewardship in overseeing the project 
activities performed under this award. Stewardship activities include, but 
are not limited to, conducting site visits; reviewing performance and 
financial reports; providing technical assistance and/or temporary 
intervention in unusual circumstances to correct deficiencies which develop 
during the project; assuring compliance with terms and conditions; and 
reviewing technical performance after project completion to ensure that the 
award objectives have been accomplished.

FUNDING OF BUDGET PERIODS

DOE has obligated $15,000,000 for completion of the Project authorized by 
this agreement; however, only $3,099,474 is available for work performed by 
the Recipient during Budget Period 1 of the Project. For Budget Periods 2 
and 3, the remainder, or $11,900,526, will be available contingent upon the 
submission by the Recipient of a continuation application and written 
approval of the continuation application by the DOE Contracting Officer.


In the event that the Recipient does not submit a continuation application 
for subsequent Budget Periods or DOE disapproves a continuation application 
for subsequent Budget Periods, the maximum DOE liability to the Recipient 
is the funds that are available for the current approved Budget Period. In 
such event, DOE reserves the right to deobligate any remaining funds.


INSOLVENCY, BANKRUPTCY OR RECEIVERSHIP

a.        You shall immediately notify the DOE of the occurrence of any of 
the following events: (i) you or your parents filing of a voluntary case 
seeking liquidation or reorganization under the Bankruptcy Act; (ii) your 
consent to the institution of an involuntary case under the Bankruptcy Act 
against you or your parent; (iii) the filing of any similar proceeding for 
or against you or your parent, or its consent to, the dissolution, 
winding-up or readjustment of your debts, appointment of a receiver, 
conservator, trustee, or other officer with similar powers over you, under 
any other applicable state or federal law; or (iv) your insolvency due to 
your inability to pay your debts generally as they become due.


b.        Such notification shall be in writing and shall: (i) specifically 
set out the details of the occurrence of an event referenced in paragraph 
a; (ii) provide the facts surrounding that event; and (iii) provide the 
impact such event will have on the project being funded by this award.


c.        Upon the occurrence of any of the four events described in the 
first paragraph, DOE reserves the right to conduct a review of your award 
to determine your compliance with the required elements of the award 
(including such items as cost share, progress towards technical project 
objectives, and submission of required reports). If the DOE review 
determines that there are significant deficiencies or concerns with your 
performance under the award, DOE reserves the right to impose additional 
requirements, as needed, including (i) change your payment method; or (ii) 
institute payment controls.


d.        Failure of the Recipient to comply with this term may be 
considered a material noncompliance of this financial assistance award by 
the Contracting Officer.


PERFORMANCE OF WORK IN UNITED STATES

The Recipient agrees that at least 75% of the direct labor cost for the 
project (including subrecipient labor) shall be incurred in the United 
States, unless the Recipient can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the 
Department of Energy that the United States economic interest will be 
better served through a greater percentage of the work being performed 
outside the United States.


NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ACT (NEPA) REQUIREMENTS

You are restricted from taking any action using Federal funds, which would 
have an adverse effect on the environment or limit the choice of reasonable 
alternatives prior to DOE providing either a NEPA clearance or a final NEPA 
decision regarding this project. Prohibited actions include: Tasks 2.3 and 
4-9 of the Statement of Project Objectives (Attachment 2). This restriction 
does not preclude you from: Tasks 1-3 (with the exception of Task 2.3) of 
the Statement of Project Objectives (Attachment 2).

SPECIAL PROVISIONS RELATING TO WORK FUNDED UNDER AMERICAN RECOVERY AND 
REINVESTMENT ACT OF 2009 (MAR 2009)

Preamble

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, Pub. L. 111-5, 
(Recovery Act) was enacted to preserve and create jobs and promote economic 
recovery, assist those most impacted by the recession, provide investments 
needed to increase economic efficiency by spurring technological advances 
in science and health, invest in transportation, environmental protection, 
and other infrastructure that will provide long-term economic benefits, 
stabilize State and local government budgets, in order to minimize and 
avoid reductions in essential services and counterproductive State and 
local tax increases. Recipients shall use grant funds in a manner that 
maximizes job creation and economic benefit.


The Recipient shall comply with all terms and conditions in the Recovery 
Act relating generally to governance, accountability, transparency, data 
collection and resources as specified in Act itself and as discussed below.


Recipients should begin planning activities for their first tier 
subrecipients, including obtaining a DUNS number (or updating the existing 
DUNS record), and registering with the Central Contractor Registration 
(CCR).


Be advised that Recovery Act funds can be used in conjunction with other 
funding as necessary to complete projects, but tracking and reporting must 
be separate to meet the reporting requirements of the Recovery Act and 
related guidance. For projects funded by sources other than the Recovery 
Act, Contractors must keep separate records for Recovery Act funds and to 
ensure those records comply with the requirements of the Act.


The Government has not fully developed the implementing instructions of the 
Recovery Act, particularly concerning specific procedural requirements for 
the new reporting requirements. The Recipient will be provided these 
details as they become available. The Recipient must comply with all 
requirements of the Act. If the recipient believes there is any 
inconsistency between ARRA requirements and current award terms and 
conditions, the issues will be referred to the Contracting Officer for 
reconciliation.


Definitions

For purposes of this term, Covered Funds means funds expended or obligated 
from appropriations under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 
2009, Pub. L. 111-5. Covered Funds will have special accounting codes and 
will be identified as Recovery Act funds in the grant, cooperative 
agreement or TIA and/or modification using Recovery Act funds. Covered 
Funds must be reimbursed by September 30, 2015.

A. Flow Down Requirement

Recipients must include these special terms and conditions in any subaward.


B. Segregation of Costs

Recipients must segregate the obligations and expenditures related to 
funding under the Recovery Act. Financial and accounting systems should be 
revised as necessary to segregate, track and maintain these funds apart and 
separate from other revenue streams. No part of the funds from the Recovery 
Act shall be commingled with any other funds or used for a purpose other 
than that of making payments for costs allowable for Recovery Act projects.


C. Prohibition on Use of Funds

None of the funds provided under this agreement derived from the American 
Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, Pub. L. 111-5, may be used by any 
State or local government, or any private entity, for any casino or other 
gambling establishment, aquarium, zoo, golf course, or swimming pool.

conditions of employment that would apply to the person in that position if 
the reprisal had not been taken.


- Order the employer to pay the employee an amount equal to the aggregate 
amount of all costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and expert 
witnesses fees) that were reasonably incurred by the employee for or in 
connection with, bringing the complaint regarding the reprisal, as 
determined by the head of a court of competent jurisdiction.


Nonenforceablity of Certain Provisions Waiving Rights and Remedies or 
Requiring Arbitration: Except as provided in a collective bargaining 
agreement, the rights and remedies provided to aggrieved employees by this 
section may not be waived by any agreement, policy, form, or condition of

the materials from which it was transformed.


Domestic iron, steel, and/or manufactured good

(1) Is wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of the United States; or


(2) In the case of a manufactured good that consists in whole or in part of 
materials from another country, has been substantially transformed in the 
United States into a new and different manufactured good distinct from the 
materials from which it was transformed. There is no requirement with 
regard to the origin of components or subcomponents in manufactured goods 
or products, as long as the manufacture of the goods occurs in the United 
States.


Foreign iron, steel, and/or manufactured good means iron, steel and/or 
manufactured good that is not domestic or designated country iron, steel, 
and/or manufactured good.

(1) The award term and condition described in this section implements-


(i) Section 1605(a) of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 
(Pub. L. 111-5) (Recovery Act), by requiring that all iron, steel, and 
manufactured goods used in the project are produced in the United States; 
and


(ii) Section 1605(d), which requires application of the Buy American 
requirement in a manner consistent with U.S. obligations under 
international agreements. The restrictions of section 1605 of the Recovery 
Act do not apply to designated country iron, steel, and/or manufactured 
goods. The Buy American requirement in section 1605 shall not be applied 
where the iron, steel or manufactured goods used in the project are from a 
Party to an international agreement that obligates the recipient to treat 
the goods and services of that Party the same as domestic goods and 
services. As of January 1, 2010, this obligation shall only apply to 
projects with an estimated value of $7,804,000 or more.


(2) The recipient shall use only domestic or designated country iron, 
steel, and manufactured goods in performing the work funded in whole or 
part with this award, except as provided in paragraphs (b)(3) and (b)(4) of 
this section.


(3) The requirement in paragraph (b)(2) of this section does not apply to 
the iron, steel, and manufactured goods listed by the Federal Government as 
follows:


TO BE DETERMINED

(4) The award official may add other iron, steel, and manufactured goods to 
the list in paragraph (b)(3) of this section if the Federal Government 
determines that


(i) The cost of domestic iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods would be 
unreasonable. The cost of domestic iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods 
used in the project is unreasonable when the cumulative cost of such 
material will increase the overall cost of the project by more than 25 
percent;
 
Page 13 of 24

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 
(ii) The iron, steel, and/or manufactured good is not produced, or 
manufactured in the United States in sufficient and reasonably available 
commercial quantities of a satisfactory quality; or


(iii) The application of the restriction of section 1605 of the Recovery 
Act would be inconsistent with the public interest.


(c) Request for determination of inapplicability of section 1605 of the 
Recovery Act or the Buy American Act.


(1)(i) Any recipient request to use foreign iron, steel, and/or 
manufactured goods in accordance with paragraph (b)(4) of this section 
shall include adequate information for Federal Government evaluation of the 
request, including


(A) A description of the foreign and domestic iron, steel, and/or 
manufactured goods;


(B) Unit of measure;


(C) Quantity;


(D) Cost;


(E) Time of delivery or availability;


(F) Location of the project;


(G) Name and address of the proposed supplier; and


(H) A detailed justification of the reason for use of foreign iron, steel, 
and/or manufactured goods cited in accordance with paragraph (b)(4) of this 
section.


(ii) A request based on unreasonable cost shall include a reasonable survey 
of the market and a completed cost comparison table in the format in 
paragraph (d) of this section.


(iii) The cost of iron, steel, or manufactured goods shall include all 
delivery costs to the construction site and any applicable duty.


(iv) Any recipient request for a determination submitted after Recovery Act 
funds have been obligated for a project for construction, alteration, 
maintenance, or repair shall explain why the recipient could not reasonably 
foresee the need for such determination and could not have requested the 
determination before the funds were obligated. If the recipient does not 
submit a satisfactory explanation, the award official need not make a 
determination.


(2) If the Federal Government determines after funds have been obligated 
for a project for construction, alteration, maintenance, or repair that an 
exception to section 1605 of the Recovery Act applies, the award official 
will amend the award to allow use of the foreign iron, steel, and/or 
relevant manufactured goods. When the basis for the exception is 
nonavailability or public interest, the amended award shall reflect 
adjustment of the award amount, redistribution of budgeted funds, and/or 
other appropriate actions taken to cover costs associated with acquiring or 
using the foreign iron, steel, and/or relevant manufactured goods. When the 
basis for the exception is the unreasonable cost of the domestic iron, 
steel, or manufactured goods, the award official shall adjust the award 
amount or redistribute budgeted funds, as appropriate, by at least the 
differential established in 2 CFR 176.110(a).


(3) Unless the Federal Government determines that an exception to section 
1605 of the Recovery Act applies, use of foreign iron, steel, and/or 
manufactured goods other than designated country iron, steel, and/or 
manufactured goods is noncompliant with the applicable Act.

WAGE RATE REQUIREMENTS UNDER SECTION 1606 OF THE RECOVERY ACT

(a) Section 1606 of the Recovery Act requires that all laborers and 
mechanics employed by contractors and subcontractors on projects funded 
directly by or assisted in whole or in part by and through the Federal 
Government pursuant to the Recovery Act shall be paid wages at rates not 
less than those prevailing on projects of a character similar in the 
locality as determined by the Secretary of Labor in accordance with 
subchapter IV of chapter 31 of title 40, United States Code.


Pursuant to Reorganization Plan No. 14 and the Copeland Act, 40 U.S.C. 
3145, the Department of Labor has issued regulations at 29 CFR parts 1, 3, 
and 5 to implement the Davis-Bacon and related Acts. Regulations in 29 CFR 
5.5 instruct agencies concerning application of the standard Davis-Bacon 
contract clauses set forth in that section. Federal agencies providing 
grants, cooperative agreements, and loans under the Recovery Act shall 
ensure that the standard Davis-Bacon contract clauses found in 29 CFR 
5.5(a) are incorporated in any resultant covered contracts that are in 
excess of $2,000 for construction, alteration or repair (including painting 
and decorating).


(b) For additional guidance on the wage rate requirements of section 1606, 
contact your awarding agency. Recipients of grants, cooperative agreements 
and loans should direct their initial inquiries concerning the application 
of Davis-Bacon requirements to a particular federally assisted project to 
the Federal agency funding the project. The Secretary of Labor retains 
final coverage authority under Reorganization Plan Number 14.


RECOVERY ACT TRANSACTIONS LISTED IN SCHEDULE OF EXPENDITURES OF FEDERAL 
AWARDS AND RECIPIENT RESPONSIBILITIES FOR INFORMING SUBRECIPIENTS

(a) To maximize the transparency and accountability of funds authorized 
under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Pub. L. 1115) 
(Recovery Act) as required by Congress and in accordance with 2 CFR 215.21 
Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Agreements and OMB 
Circular A102 Common Rules provisions, recipients agree to maintain 
records that identify adequately the source and application of Recovery Act 
funds. OMB Circular A102 is available at http://
www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/a102/a102.html.
 
Page 15 of 24

------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
(b) For recipients covered by the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 and 
OMB Circular A133, Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit 
Organizations, recipients agree to separately identify the expenditures 
for Federal awards under the Recovery Act on the Schedule of Expenditures 
of Federal Awards (SEFA) and the Data Collection Form (SFSAC) required by 
OMB Circular A133. OMB Circular A133 is available at 
http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/a133/a133.html. This shall be 
accomplished by identifying expenditures for Federal awards made under the 
Recovery Act separately on the SEFA, and as separate rows under Item 9 of 
Part III on the SFSAC by CFDA number, and inclusion of the prefix ARRA- 
in identifying the name of the Federal program on the SEFA and as the first 
characters in Item 9d of Part III on the SFSAC.


(c) Recipients agree to separately identify to each subrecipient, and 
document at the time of subaward and at the time of disbursement of funds, 
the Federal award number, CFDA number, and amount of Recovery Act funds. 
When a recipient awards Recovery Act funds for an existing program, the 
information furnished to subrecipients shall distinguish the subawards of 
incremental Recovery Act funds from regular subawards under the existing 
program.


(d) Recipients agree to require their subrecipients to include on their 
SEFA information to specifically identify Recovery Act funding similar to 
the requirements for the recipient SEFA described above. This information 
is needed to allow the recipient to properly monitor subrecipient 
expenditure of ARRA funds as well as oversight by the Federal awarding 
agencies, Offices of Inspector General and the Government Accountability 
Office.


DAVIS BACON ACT AND CONTRACT WORK HOURS AND SAFETY STANDARDS ACT

(a) Davis Bacon Act

(1) Minimum wages.

(i) All laborers and mechanics employed or working upon the site of the 
work (or under the United States Housing Act of 1937 or under the Housing 
Act of 1949 in the construction or development of the project), will be 
paid unconditionally and not less often than once a week, and without 
subsequent deduction or rebate on any account (except such payroll 
deductions as are permitted by regulations issued by the Secretary of Labor 
under the Copeland Act (29 CFR part 3) ), the full amount of wages and bona 
fide fringe benefits (or cash equivalents thereof) due at time of payment 
computed at rates not less than those contained in the wage determination 
of the Secretary of Labor which is reserved for attachment hereto and shall 
be made a part hereof upon determination of a host site for the project, 
regardless of any contractual relationship which may be alleged to exist 
between the Contractor and such laborers and mechanics.

Contributions made or costs reasonably anticipated for bona fide fringe 
benefits under section 1(b)(2) of the Davis-Bacon Act on behalf of laborers 
or mechanics are considered wages paid to such laborers or mechanics, 
subject to the provisions of paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this section; also, 
regular contributions made or costs incurred for more than a weekly period 
(but not less often than quarterly) under plans, funds, or programs which 
cover the particular weekly period, are deemed to be constructively made or 
incurred during such weekly period. Such laborers and mechanics shall be 
paid the appropriate wage rate and fringe benefits on the wage 
determination for the classification of work actually performed, without 
regard to skill, except as provided in § 5.5(a)(4). Laborers or mechanics 
performing work in more than one classification may be compensated at the 
rate specified for each classification for the time actually worked 
therein: Provided, That the employers payroll records accurately set forth 
the time spent in each classification in which work is performed. The wage 
determination (including any additional classification and wage rates 
conformed under paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section) and the Davis-Bacon 
poster (WH-1321) shall be posted at all times by the Contractor and its 
subcontractors at the site of the work in a prominent and accessible place 
where it can be easily seen by the workers.

(ii)(A) The Contracting Officer shall require that any class of laborers or 
mechanics, including helpers, which is not listed in the wage determination 
and which is to be employed under the Contract shall be classified in 
conformance with the wage determination. The Contracting Officer shall 
approve an additional classification and wage rate and fringe benefits 
therefore only when the following criteria have been met:

(1) The work to be performed by the classification requested is not 
performed by a classification in the wage determination; and

(2) The classification is utilized in the area by the construction 
industry; and

(3) The proposed wage rate, including any bona fide fringe benefits, bears 
a reasonable relationship to the wage rates contained in the wage 
determination.
 
Page 17 of 24

------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
(B) If the Contractor and the laborers and mechanics to be employed in the 
classification (if known), or their representatives, and the Contracting 
Officer agree on the classification and wage rate (including the amount 
designated for fringe benefits where appropriate), a report of the action 
taken shall be sent by the Contracting Officer to the Administrator of the 
Wage and Hour Division, U.S. Department of Labor, Washington, DC 20210. The 
Administrator, or an authorized representative, will approve, modify, or 
disapprove every additional classification action within 30 days of receipt 
and so advise the Contracting Officer or will notify the Contracting 
Officer within the 30-day period that additional time is necessary.

(C) In the event the Contractor, the laborers or mechanics to be employed 
in the classification or their representatives, and the Contracting Officer 
do not agree on the proposed classification and wage rate (including the 
amount designated for fringe benefits, where appropriate), the Contracting 
Officer shall refer the questions, including the views of all interested 
parties and the recommendation of the Contracting Officer, to the 
Administrator for determination. The Administrator, or an authorized 
representative, will issue a determination within 30 days of receipt and so 
advise the Contracting Officer or will notify the Contracting Officer 
within the 30-day period that additional time is necessary.

(D) The wage rate (including fringe benefits where appropriate) determined 
pursuant to paragraphs (a)(1)(ii)(B) or (C) of this section, shall be paid 
to all workers performing work in the classification under this Contract 
from the first day on which work is performed in the classification.

(iii) Whenever the minimum wage rate prescribed in the Contract for a class 
of laborers or mechanics includes a fringe benefit which is not expressed 
as an hourly rate, the Contractor shall either pay the benefit as stated in 
the wage determination or shall pay another bona fide fringe benefit or an 
hourly cash equivalent thereof.

(iv) If the Contractor does not make payments to a trustee or other third 
person, the Contractor may consider as part of the wages of any laborer or 
mechanic the amount of any costs reasonably anticipated in providing bona 
fide fringe benefits under a plan or program, Provided, That the Secretary 
of Labor has found, upon the written request of the Contractor, that the 
applicable standards of the Davis-Bacon Act have been met. The Secretary of 
Labor may require the Contractor to set aside in a separate account assets 
for the meeting of obligations under the plan or program.

(2) Withholding. The Department of Energy or the Recipient or Subrecipient 
shall upon its own action or upon written request of an authorized 
representative of the Department of Labor withhold or cause to be withheld 
from the Contractor under this Contract or any other Federal contract with 
the same prime contractor, or any other federally-assisted contract subject 
to Davis-Bacon prevailing wage requirements, which is held by the same 
prime contractor, so much of the accrued payments or advances as may be 
considered necessary to pay laborers and mechanics, including apprentices, 
trainees, and helpers, employed by the Contractor or any subcontractor the 
full amount of wages required by the Contract. In the event of failure to 
pay any laborer or mechanic, including any apprentice, trainee, or helper, 
employed or working on the site of the work (or under the United States 
Housing Act of 1937 or under the Housing Act of 1949 in the construction or 
development of the project), all or part of the wages required by the 
Contract, the Department of Energy, Recipient, or Subrecipient, may, after 
written notice to the Contractor, sponsor, applicant, or owner, take such 
action as may be necessary to cause the suspension of any further payment, 
advance, or guarantee of funds until such violations have ceased.
 
Page 18 of 24

------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
(3) Payrolls and basic records.

(i) Payrolls and basic records relating thereto shall be maintained by the 
Contractor during the course of the work and preserved for a period of 
three years thereafter for all laborers and mechanics working at the site 
of the work (or under the United States Housing Act of 1937, or under the 
Housing Act of 1949, in the construction or development of the project). 
Such records shall contain the name, address, and social security number of 
each such worker, his or her correct classification, hourly rates of wages 
paid (including rates of contributions or costs anticipated for bona fide 
fringe benefits or cash equivalents thereof of the types described in 
section 1(b)(2)(B) of the Davis-Bacon Act), daily and weekly number of 
hours worked, deductions made and actual wages paid. Whenever the Secretary 
of Labor has found under 29 CFR 5.5(a)(1)(iv) that the wages of any laborer 
or mechanic include the amount of any costs reasonably anticipated in 
providing benefits under a plan or program described in section 1(b)(2)(B) 
of the Davis-Bacon Act, the Contractor shall maintain records which show 
that the commitment to provide such benefits is enforceable, that the plan 
or program is financially responsible, and that the plan or program has 
been communicated in writing to the laborers or mechanics affected, and 
records which show the costs anticipated or the actual cost incurred in 
providing such benefits. Contractors employing apprentices or trainees 
under approved programs shall maintain written evidence of the registration 
of apprenticeship programs and certification of trainee programs, the 
registration of the apprentices and trainees, and the ratios and wage rates 
prescribed in the applicable programs.
 
  	(ii) 	(A) The Contractor shall submit weekly for each week in which any 
Contract work is performed a copy of all payrolls to the Department of 
Energy if the agency is a party to the Contract, but if the agency is not 
such a party, the Contractor will submit the payrolls to the Recipient or 
Subrecipient (as applicable), applicant, sponsor, or owner, as the case may 
be, for transmission to the Department of Energy. The payrolls submitted 
shall set out accurately and completely all of the information required to 
be maintained under 29 CFR 5.5(a)(3)(i), except that full social security 
numbers and home addresses shall not be included on weekly transmittals. 
Instead the payrolls shall only need to include an individually identifying 
number for each employee (e.g., the last four digits of the employees 
social security number). The required weekly payroll information may be 
submitted in any form desired. Optional Form WH-347 is available for this 
purpose from the Wage and Hour Division Web site at 
http://www.dol.gov/esa/whd/forms/wh347instr.htm or its successor site. The 
prime Contractor is responsible for the submission of copies of payrolls by 
all subcontractors. Contractors and subcontractors shall maintain the full 
social security number and current address of each covered worker, and 
shall provide them upon request to the Department of Energy if the agency 
is a party to the Contract, but if the agency is not such a party, the 
Contractor will submit them to the Recipient or Subrecipient (as 
applicable), applicant, sponsor, or owner, as the case may be, for 
transmission to the Department of Energy, the Contractor, or the Wage and 
Hour Division of the Department of Labor for purposes of an investigation 
or audit of compliance with prevailing wage requirements. It is not a 
violation of this section for a prime contractor to require a subcontractor 
to provide addresses and social security numbers to the prime contractor 
for its own records, without weekly submission to the sponsoring government 
agency (or the Recipient or Subrecipient (as applicable), applicant, 
sponsor, or owner).

(B) Each payroll submitted shall be accompanied by a Statement of 
Compliance, signed by the Contractor or subcontractor or his or her agent 
who pays or supervises the payment of the persons employed under the 
Contract and shall certify the following:

(1) That the payroll for the payroll period contains the information 
required to be provided under § 5.5 (a)(3)(ii) of Regulations, 29 CFR part 
5, the appropriate information is being maintained under § 5.5 (a)(3)(i) of 
Regulations, 29 CFR part 5, and that such information is correct and 
complete;
 
Page 19 of 24

------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
(2) That each laborer or mechanic (including each helper, apprentice, and 
trainee) employed on the Contract during the payroll period has been paid 
the full weekly wages earned, without rebate, either directly or 
indirectly, and that no deductions have been made either directly or 
indirectly from the full wages earned, other than permissible deductions as 
set forth in Regulations, 29 CFR part 3;

(3) That each laborer or mechanic has been paid not less than the 
applicable wage rates and fringe benefits or cash equivalents for the 
classification of work performed, as specified in the applicable wage 
determination incorporated into the Contract.

(C) The weekly submission of a properly executed certification set forth on 
the reverse side of Optional Form WH-347 shall satisfy the requirement for 
submission of the Statement of Compliance required by paragraph 
(a)(3)(ii)(B) of this section.

(D) The falsification of any of the above certifications may subject the 
Contractor or subcontractor to civil or criminal prosecution under section 
1001 of title 18 and section 3729 of title 31 of the United States Code.

(iii) The Contractor or subcontractor shall make the records required under 
paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section available for inspection, copying, or 
transcription by authorized representatives of the Department of Energy or 
the Department of Labor, and shall permit such representatives to interview 
employees during working hours on the job. If the Contractor or 
subcontractor fails to submit the required records or to make them 
available, the Federal agency may, after written notice to the Contractor, 
sponsor, applicant, or owner, take such action as may be necessary to cause 
the suspension of any further payment, advance, or guarantee of funds. 
Furthermore, failure to submit the required records upon request or to make 
such records available may be grounds for debarment action pursuant to 29 
CFR 5.12.


(4) Apprentices and trainees

(i) Apprentices. Apprentices will be permitted to work at less than the 
predetermined rate for the work they performed when they are employed 
pursuant to and individually registered in a bona fide apprenticeship 
program registered with the U.S. Department of Labor, Employment and 
Training Administration, Office of Apprenticeship Training, Employer and 
Labor Services, or with a State Apprenticeship Agency recognized by the 
Office, or if a person is employed in his or her first 90 days of 
probationary employment as an apprentice in such an apprenticeship program, 
who is not individually registered in the program, but who has been 
certified by the Office of Apprenticeship Training, Employer and Labor 
Services or a State Apprenticeship Agency (where appropriate) to be 
eligible for probationary employment as an apprentice. The allowable ratio 
of apprentices to journeymen on the job site in any craft classification 
shall not be greater than the ratio permitted to the Contractor as to the 
entire work force under the registered program. Any worker listed on a 
payroll at an apprentice wage rate, who is not registered or otherwise 
employed as stated above, shall be paid not less than the applicable wage 
rate on the wage determination for the classification of work actually 
performed. In addition, any apprentice performing work on the job site in 
excess of the ratio permitted under the registered program shall be paid 
not less than the applicable wage rate on the wage determination for the 
work actually performed. Where a Contractor is performing construction on a 
project in a locality other than that in which its program is registered, 
the ratios and wage rates (expressed in percentages of the journeymans 
hourly rate) specified in the Contractors or subcontractors registered 
program shall be observed. Every apprentice must be paid at not less than 
the rate specified in the registered program for

------------------------------------------------------------------------
the apprentices level of progress, expressed as a percentage of the 
journeymen hourly rate specified in the applicable wage determination. 
Apprentices shall be paid fringe benefits in accordance with the provisions 
of the apprenticeship program. If the apprenticeship program does not 
specify fringe benefits, apprentices must be paid the full amount of fringe 
benefits listed on the wage determination for the applicable 
classification. If the Administrator determines that a different practice 
prevails for the applicable apprentice classification, fringes shall be 
paid in accordance with that determination. In the event the Office of 
Apprenticeship Training, Employer and Labor Services, or a State 
Apprenticeship Agency recognized by the Office, withdraws approval of an 
apprenticeship program, the Contractor will no longer be permitted to 
utilize apprentices at less than the applicable predetermined rate for the 
work performed until an acceptable program is approved.

(ii) Trainees. Except as provided in 29 CFR 5.16, trainees will not be 
permitted to work at less than the predetermined rate for the work 
performed unless they are employed pursuant to and individually registered 
in a program which has received prior approval, evidenced by formal 
certification by the U.S. Department of Labor, Employment and Training 
Administration. The ratio of trainees to journeymen on the job site shall 
not be greater than permitted under the plan approved by the Employment and 
Training Administration. Every trainee must be paid at not less than the 
rate specified in the approved program for the trainees level of progress, 
expressed as a percentage of the journeyman hourly rate specified in the 
applicable wage determination. Trainees shall be paid fringe benefits in 
accordance with the provisions of the trainee program. If the trainee 
program does not mention fringe benefits, trainees shall be paid the full 
amount of fringe benefits listed on the wage determination unless the 
Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division determines that there is an 
apprenticeship program associated with the corresponding journeyman wage 
rate on the wage determination which provides for less than full fringe 
benefits for apprentices. Any employee listed on the payroll at a trainee 
rate who is not registered and participating in a training plan approved by 
the Employment and Training Administration shall be paid not less than the 
applicable wage rate on the wage determination for the classification of 
work actually performed. In addition, any trainee performing work on the 
job site in excess of the ratio permitted under the registered program 
shall be paid not less than the applicable wage rate on the wage 
determination for the work actually performed. In the event the Employment 
and Training Administration withdraws approval of a training program, the 
Contractor will no longer be permitted to utilize trainees at less than the 
applicable predetermined rate for the work performed until an acceptable 
program is approved.

(iii) Equal employment opportunity. The utilization of apprentices, 
trainees and journeymen under this part shall be in conformity with the 
equal employment opportunity requirements of Executive Order 11246, as 
amended and 29 CFR part 30.

(5) Compliance with Copeland Act requirements. The Contractor shall comply 
with the requirements of 29 CFR part 3, which are incorporated by reference 
in this Contract.

(6) Contracts and Subcontracts. The Recipient, Subrecipient, the 
Recipients and Subrecipients contractors and subcontractor shall insert 
in any Contracts the clauses contained herein in(a)(1) through (10) and 
such other clauses as the Department of Energy may by appropriate 
instructions require, and also a clause requiring the subcontractors to 
include these clauses in any lower tier subcontracts. The Recipient shall 
be responsible for the compliance by any subcontractor or lower tier 
subcontractor with all of the paragraphs in this clause.

(7) Contract termination: debarment. A breach of the Contract clauses in 29 
CFR 5.5 may be grounds for termination of the Contract, and for debarment 
as a contractor and a subcontractor as provided in 29 CFR 5.12.

(8) Compliance with Davis-Bacon and Related Act requirements. All rulings 
and interpretations of the Davis-Bacon and Related Acts contained in 29 CFR 
parts 1, 3, and 5 are herein incorporated by reference in this Contract.

(9) Disputes concerning labor standards. Disputes arising out of the labor 
standards provisions of this Contract shall not be subject to the general 
disputes clause of this Contract. Such disputes shall be resolved in 
accordance with the procedures of the Department of Labor set forth in 29 
CFR parts 5, 6, and 7. Disputes within the meaning of this clause include 
disputes between the Recipient, Subrecipient, the Contractor (or any of its 
subcontractors) and the contracting agency, the U.S. Department of Labor, 
or the employees or their representatives.

(10) Certification of eligibility.

(i) By entering into this Contract, the Contractor certifies that neither 
it (nor he or she) nor any person or firm who has an interest in the 
Contractors firm is a person or firm ineligible to be awarded Government 
contracts by virtue of section 3(a) of the Davis-Bacon Act or 29 CFR 
5.12(a)(1).

(ii) No part of this Contract shall be subcontracted to any person or firm 
ineligible for award of a Government contract by virtue of section 3(a) of 
the Davis-Bacon Act or 29 CFR 5.12(a)(1).

(iii) The penalty for making false statements is prescribed in the U.S.

paragraph, the terms laborers and mechanics include watchmen and guards.

(1) Overtime requirements. No Contractor or subcontractor contracting for 
any part of the Contract work which may require or involve the employment 
of laborers or mechanics shall require or permit any such laborer or 
mechanic in any workweek in which he or she is employed on such work to 
work in excess of forty hours in such workweek unless such laborer or 
mechanic receives compensation at a rate not less than one and one-half 
times the basic rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of forty hours 
in such workweek.

(2) Violation; liability for unpaid wages; liquidated damages. In the event 
of any violation of the clause set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section the Contractor and any subcontractor responsible therefore shall be 
liable for the unpaid wages. In addition, such Contractor and subcontractor 
shall be liable to the United States (in the case of work done under 
contract for the District of Columbia or a territory, to such District or 
to such territory), for liquidated damages. Such liquidated damages shall 
be computed with respect to each individual laborer or mechanic, including 
watchmen and guards, employed in violation of the clause set forth in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section, in the sum of $10 for each calendar day 
on which such individual was required or permitted to work in excess of the 
standard workweek of forty hours without payment of the overtime wages 
required by the clause set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

(3) Withholding for unpaid wages and liquidated damages. The Department of 
Energy or the Recipient or Subrecipient shall upon its own action or upon 
written request of an authorized representative of the Department of Labor 
withhold or cause to be withheld, from any moneys payable on account of 
work performed by the Contractor or subcontractor under any such contract 
or any other Federal contract with the same prime Contractor, or any other 
federally-assisted contract subject to the Contract Work Hours and Safety 
Standards Act, which is held by the same prime contractor, such sums as may 
be determined to be necessary to satisfy any liabilities of such Contractor 
or subcontractor for unpaid wages and liquidated damages as provided in the 
clause set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

any Contracts, the clauses set forth in paragraph (b)(1) through (4) of 
this section and also a clause requiring the subcontractors to include 
these clauses in any lower tier subcontracts. The Recipient shall be 
responsible for compliance by any subcontractor or lower tier subcontractor 
with the clauses set forth in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this 
section.

(5) The Contractor or subcontractor shall maintain payrolls and basic 
payroll records during the course of the work and shall preserve them for a 
period of three years from the completion of the Contract for all laborers 
and mechanics, including guards and watchmen, working on the Contract. Such
