Re: Consent Letter Regarding S-1 Registration Statement and Related 
Exhibits

Subject to our receipt of your signature below, notwithstanding the 
confidentiality and/or consent provisions in the structured settlement 
receivables purchase program documents entered into between us and certain 
of your affiliates on February 1, 2010, as amended or modified, we hereby 
consent to the descriptions of us, and the descriptions of our structured 
settlement transaction, each as set forth in the Form S-1 Registration 
Statement provided to us by way of that certain November 8, 2010, 5:04 p.m. 
(Eastern) e-mail from Michael Kirwan (the Proposed Registration Statement
).

This Consent Letter applies only with respect to the Proposed Registration 
Statement and not to any prior subsequent or modified version thereof or 
any other document or disclosure, which, for the avoidance of doubt, to the 
extent such version modifies the description of us or the description of 
our structured settlements, would require a separate Consent Letter, to be 
provided or withheld in our sole and absolute discretion. Furthermore, for 
the avoidance of doubt, this Consent Letter is provided by us and does not 
purport to provide any consent that may be required from or with respect to 
any other party.

By signing below:

  	1. 	  	You represent, warrant and covenant that you (a) have consulted 
with appropriate professional advisors, such as your independent 
accountants, tax advisors and/or attorneys, regarding the appropriate 
accounting, tax and legal requirements (including disclosure requirements) 
regarding the Registration Statement and any exhibits thereto and (b) have 
made all relevant documents and information available to such advisors.
 
  	2. 	  	you acknowledge that, and represent and warrant that you 
understand that, (a) neither we nor any of our affiliates, nor any of our 
or their respective officers, directors, employees, agents or 
representatives (collectively, Representatives), have provided you or 
your advisors with any accounting, tax, legal or other professional advice 
(including disclosure advice) and (b) you have not, and you have not 
authorized or directed your advisors or representatives to, rely upon any 
such advice from any such party, and

  	3. 	  	you agree to, on an after-tax basis and as such amounts are 
incurred, defend, indemnify and hold harmless us and our affiliates, and 
our and their respective Representatives, successors and assigns (each, an 
Indemnified Party), against any and all liability, loss, damage or 
expense, including without limitation attorneys fees and expenses 
(collectively, Losses), incurred by any such Indemnified Party in 
connection with any investigation, inquiry, action, suit, demand or claim 
for sums of money brought or made against any such Indemnified Party 
relating to the Proposed Registration Statement or any supplement or 
amendment thereto, for any actual or alleged violations of state or federal 
securities laws with respect to any untrue statement or alleged untrue 
statement of a material fact contained in the Proposed Registration 
Statement or any supplement or amendment thereto or any omission or alleged 
omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the 
statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they 
were made, not misleading, and
 
  	4. 	  	you agree that if for any reason the indemnification provided for 
above is unavailable or is insufficient to hold an Indemnified Party 
harmless, then you shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such 
Indemnified Party as a result of such Losses in such proportion as is 
appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits received by such 
Indemnified Party, on the one hand, and the indemnifying party, on the 
other hand, but also the relative fault of such indemnified party, on the 
one hand, and the Indemnifying Party, on the other hand, as well as any 
other relevant equitable considerations.

We hereby consent to the filing of this Consent Letter as an exhibit to the 
Proposed Registration Statement. In delivering this Consent Letter, we do 
not hereby admit that it comes within the category of persons whose consent 
is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or 
the rules or regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission 
promulgated thereunder. In giving this Consent Letter, we are not assuming 
any responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of the Proposed 
Registration Statement.
