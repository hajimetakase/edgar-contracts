  the Know-How to develop, make, have made, use, sell, have sold, offer for

  Improvements in the Field (collectively Somaxon Licenses). For the
  avoidance of doubt, the scope of the Somaxon Licenses shall extend to
  Combination Products.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

  2.3 Disclosure of Know-How and Patent Rights. ProCom One shall promptly
  deliver to Somaxon or provide Somaxon with copies of (1) all documents,
  drawings, specifications, programs, devices and equipment relating to,
  and all other tangible manifestations of, the Know-How; and (2) all
  patent applications (for which U.S. and international patents have not
  issued) included in the Patent Rights.

  2.4 Improvements. ProCom One shall promptly disclose and communicate to
  Somaxon any Improvements discovered, invented, originated, made,
  conceived or acquired by ProCom One after the Effective Date
  (collectively ProCom One Improvements) and all such ProCom One
  Improvements shall automatically be included within the scope of the
  Know-How and Patent Rights and each partys rights to such ProCom One
  Improvements shall be governed in accordance with the terms of this
  Agreement. Each party to this Agreement shall take Commercially
  Reasonable Efforts to protect and ensure the secrecy, confidentiality and
  value of all Improvements, excluding any portion of the Improvements that
  shall have become generally known to the public (other than as a result
  of the improper disclosure thereof by such party). Nothing in this
  Agreement imposes any duty or obligation on either party to acquire,
  discover, invent, originate or develop any Improvement.

  2.5 Additional Patents. Consistent with clause (iii) of the definition of
  Patent Rights, if, during the term of this Agreement, ProCom One obtains
  the rights to any patents or patent applications, the claims of which
  cover any Improvements, such patents and patent applications shall be
  automatically, without any further action of the parties, be included in
  the licensed Patent Rights. ProCom One shall provide reasonably prompt
  notice to Somaxon of any prospective patentable rights and shall consult
  with Somaxon concerning ProCom Ones plans for the prosecution of the
  related patent rights. Furthermore, ProCom One shall provide Somaxon with
  a reasonable period of time to comment on any related patent application
  prior to the filing of such patent application and shall use Commercially
  Reasonable Efforts to accommodate any comments and other suggestions from
  Somaxon with respect to the patent application and patent prosecution
  strategy.

  2.6 Intellectual Property Rights beyond Somaxon Licenses.

  2.6.1 Somaxon will have the right of first negotiation to acquire rights
  under any intellectual property rights developed by Dr. Kavey and/or
  ProCom One beyond the Somaxon Licenses which do not constitute ProCom One
  Improvements. ProCom One will promptly provide notice to Somaxon of such
  developments and Somaxon will have the right of first negotiation to
  acquire rights thereunder during a period of ninety (90) days following
  its receipt of such notice. In the event the parties fail to come to
  terms with respect to any such additional intellectual property rights,
  ProCom One shall have the right to enter into a transaction with any
  third party with respect to the specific intellectual property rights it
  had offered to Somaxon on terms that are more favorable to ProCom One
  than those last offered by Somaxon to ProCom One in connection with the
  parties negotiations.

  2.6.2 In order to facilitate verification by Somaxon that the terms of
  any third party transaction are in fact more favorable to ProCom One than
  those last offered to ProCom One by Somaxon in connection with the
  parties negotiations under Section 2.6.1 above, prior to entering into
  any definitive agreement with a third party concerning any matter that is
  subject to the foregoing right of first negotiation, ProCom One shall
  provide Somaxon with a true, accurate and complete copy of the proposed
  definitive agreement certified as such by an officer of ProCom One and
  shall thereafter provide to Somaxon a copy of any amendments to the
  definitive agreement affecting the economic and other materials terms
  thereof. The terms of any such definitive agreement and amendments shall
  be deemed to be confidential information for purposes of Section 6 below, 
  provided that Somaxon may submit such agreement and amendments to the
  arbitrator in the event of any dispute under Section 10 below.

  approval of the initial Licensed Product and, (iii) subject to applicable
  regulatory and marketing approval, commercialize such Licensed Product.
  In furtherance of such development, Somaxon shall consult with ProCom One
  with respect to development plans, timelines and budgets and generally
  keep ProCom One informed of material progress and delays, if any, in the
  development through the periodic meetings of Somaxons Board of Directors
  (to which ProCom One is entitled to appoint a designee as set forth in
  Section 3.5 below). In the event that any dispute between the parties
  arises related to Somaxons compliance with the diligence requirements of
  this Agreement, the parties shall resolve such dispute in accordance with
  Section 10.

  3.2 Clinical Trials. Somaxon shall be responsible for conducting all
  clinical trials and for all regulatory filings and interactions with

  to Section 4.2. Such royalty report shall be accompanied by the total
  Royalty due to ProCom One. All payments shall be made in U.S. Dollars.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

  4.4 Record keeping by Somaxon. Somaxon shall keep accurate books of
  accounts of record in connection with the manufacture, use and sale of
  Licensed Products to permit verification of Royalty payments required
  hereunder. Such records shall be maintained for a period of at least
  three (3) years from the date on which they were generated.

  4.5 Audit by ProCom One. ProCom One shall have the right, at its own
  expense, to access books and records of Somaxon as may be reasonably
  necessary to verify the accuracy of the reports and payments made
  hereunder. Such access shall be conducted upon reasonable written notice
  to Somaxon and during normal business hours. Such access shall not be
  more frequent than once per calendar year. Upon Somaxons written
  request, ProCom One shall require the auditing party to sign a
  confidentiality agreement for the benefit of Somaxon. The results of such
  audit shall be made available to Somaxon. If any audit discloses that the
  payments by Somaxon to ProCom One are incorrect in either Somaxons or
  ProCom Ones favor, then the other party shall pay any amount due to the
  other party within ten (10) days after receipt of the necessary
  documentation of the amount owed. If ProCom Ones audit demonstrates an
  underpayment of more than five percent (5%) for the payment due to ProCom
  One during any individual calendar quarter, Somaxon shall be liable for
  ProCom Ones cost of the audit that discovered such underpayment.
  Otherwise, the parties shall bear their own costs of such audits.

  4.6 Withholding Taxes. Each party shall be responsible for the payment of
  taxes attributed to its share of Net Sales. Where required to do so by
  applicable law, rule or order of a governmental body, Somaxon shall
  withhold taxes required to be paid to a taxing authority in connection
  with any payments to ProCom One hereunder, and, upon request of ProCom
  One, Somaxon shall furnish ProCom One with satisfactory evidence of such
  withholding and payment. Somaxon shall cooperate with ProCom One in
  obtaining exemption from withholding taxes where available under
  applicable law.

  4.7 Equity. The parties hereby acknowledge and agree that all Somaxon
  equity to be issued to ProCom One, Dr. Kavey or Mr. Cobb as consideration
  for the licenses granted hereunder has been duly and validly issued prior
  to the Agreement Date.

  5. 	  	
  PATENT RIGHTS

  5.1 Patent Prosecution and Maintenance. Except to the extent otherwise
  agreed by the parties, Somaxon shall be responsible for the preparation,
  filing, prosecution and maintenance of the Patent Rights, including all
  payment obligations. Somaxon will provide ProCom One with notice of
  Somaxons intent to amend any patent claims within the Patent Rights and,
  time permitting, will permit to ProCom One to review prosecution drafts,
  to provide input and strategy suggestions, however, Somaxon will have the
  sole discretion to determine and direct claim amendments and prosecution
  strategy. Somaxon acknowledges that ProCom One has provided to Somaxon a
  schedule setting forth the timing of all maintenance fees and other
  material prosecution and maintenance activities scheduled with respect to
  the Patent Rights, to the extent, with respect to patent applications
  contained therein, that such patent applications are not being prepared
  and/or prosecuted by or on behalf of Somaxon. ProCom One shall timely
  execute powers of attorney and such other documentation as shall be
  reasonably requested by Somaxon to facilitate Somaxons performance as
  contemplated herein. Somaxon shall provide written notice to ProCom One
  from time to time as Somaxon makes any required maintenance payments and
  as any new material information relating to the preparation, filing,
  prosecution or maintenance of the Patent Rights comes to its attention.
  Somaxon will provide ProCom One with notice of Somaxons intent to
  abandon any pending patent application included within the Patent Rights
  or to terminate payment of any maintenance fees relating to the Patent
  Rights in sufficient time prior to the abandonment date or maintenance
  fee due date to permit Procom One at its own expense to make any such
  required payments or take any such required action.

  5.2 Patent Enforcement.

  5.2.1 If either party should become aware of any infringement or
  misappropriation or threatened infringement or misappropriation of the
  Patent Rights, it shall promptly notify the other party in writing and
  provide any information available to that party relating to such alleged
  infringement or misappropriation.

  5.2.2 Somaxon shall have the primary right, but not the obligation, to
  take action in its own name and its expense to secure the cessation of
  any infringement or misappropriation or to institute, prosecute and
  control legal proceedings to prevent or restrain such infringement or
  misappropriation concerning the Patent Rights in the Field. ProCom One
  agrees to assist Somaxon, at Somaxons expense, in the prosecution of any
  action or legal proceedings related to infringement or misappropriation
  of the Patent Rights in the Field. If requested by Somaxon, ProCom One
  agrees (a) to join any action or legal proceeding to enforce the Patent
  Rights in the Field against any third party or (b) to bring such action
  or proceeding in its own name (at Somaxons expense and subject to
  Somaxons prosecution and control), if required by applicable law or
  regulation for such action or proceeding to be brought or continue. If
  Somaxon takes action or prosecutes legal proceedings relating to the
  infringement or misappropriation of the Patent Rights in the Field, after
  payment of ProCom Ones out-of-pocket costs and Royalty due to ProCom One
  on any award of lost profits, all other damages and costs recovered in
  any action or proceedings or by way of settlement shall belong to
  Somaxon.

  5.2.3 In the event that Somaxon takes no action within six (6) months of
  notice of any such infringement or misappropriation, ProCom One shall
  have the right, but not the obligation, to take action in its own name
  and its expense to secure the cessation of any such infringement or
  misappropriation or to institute, prosecute and control legal proceedings
  to prevent or restrain such infringement or misappropriation concerning
  the Patent Rights in the Field. If requested by ProCom One, Somaxon
  agrees to join any action or legal proceeding to enforce the Patent
  Rights in the Field against any third party. If ProCom One takes action
  or prosecutes legal proceedings relating to the infringement or
  misappropriation of the Patent Rights in the Field, after payment of
  Somaxons out-of-pocket costs, all other damages and costs recovered in
  any action or proceedings or by way of settlement shall belong to ProCom
  One.

  5.3 Infringement Action by a Third Party. In the event of the institution
  of any suit by a third party against Somaxon for patent infringement
  arising from the manufacture, use, sale, distribution or marketing of any
  Licensed Product, Somaxon shall promptly notify ProCom One in writing of
  such suit. Somaxon shall have the sole right to defend such suit at its
  own cost and expense, and ProCom One shall, at Somaxons expense, assist
  and cooperate with Somaxon in the defense of such suit. If a judgment is
  rendered against Somaxon in such suit and Somaxon is required to pay any
  monies or royalty for past or future use (Third Party Expense) based
  solely upon use of the Compounds both (i) in the Field, and (ii) within
  the Ranges, Somaxon may deduct the Third Party Expense (and its cost of
  defense of such action) from its future royalty payment obligations to
  ProCom One pursuant to Section 4.3 up to an amount not to exceed one-half
  (1/2) of such future Royalty payment obligations to ProCom One pursuant
  to such Section 4.2. Such deductions shall further not exceed one-half
  (1/2) of each quarterly Royalty payment made by Somaxon to ProCom One
  pursuant to Section 4.2 hereof.
