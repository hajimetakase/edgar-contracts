    the K1 and K2 Vehicle Programs for the life of the program contingent
    on meeting Fiskers continued engineering specifications, performance,
    quality, durability, total landed cost, supply chain and delivery
    requirements.  After Fisker has purchased the initial [**] batteries
    from A123 for the K1 and K2 Vehicle Program, if Fisker determines and
    is able to document that A123 is uncompetitive in any of the afore
    mentioned areas by more than [**]%, Fisker shall give A123 written
    notice of the deviation.  A123 shall then have [**] days in which to
    close the competitive gap and retain the business.  Should this gap not
    be closed within the [**] days, Fisker shall have the right to
    re-source all or any part of the business, in Fiskers sole discretion.
     
    2.             Future Program Awards.  Fisker is in the process of
    developing a third Program, currently designated as the Nina Program. 
    The Nina program will be competitively bid. The parties intend that
    A123 shall supply batteries for the Nina Program based on A123 meeting
    Fisker Automotive Incs. engineering specifications, performance,
    quality, reliability, durability, total landed cost, supply chain and
    delivery requirements as stated in the Product manual.  Should Fisker
    receive alternative, qualified, competitive bids it agrees that it
    shall, subject to its confidentiality obligations, provide A123 with
    written notice of the A123 gaps based on the qualified bids it has
    received. The parties will mutually agree proceedure for treating third
    party confidential information.  A123 shall have [**] days to match the
    [**] of the competitive offers. If A123 is able to match the
    alternative bid, then A123 will be awarded the production Program. If
    A123 is awarded the Program, should Fisker determine and be able to
    document A123 to be uncompetitive in any of the afore mentioned areas
    by more than [**]%, Fisker shall give A123 written notice of the
    deviation.  A123 shall then have [**] days in which to close the
    competitive gap and retain the business.  Should this gap not be closed
    within the [**] days, Fisker shall have the right to re-source the
    business.
     
    3.             Intentionally Left Blank
     
    4.             Term. This Agreement will become effective on the date
    of the last Party to sign this Agreement (the Effective Date) and

GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF PURCHASE
 
1.             The Supplies and Parties Covered by the Order
 
    (a)           Supplies
     
These General Terms and Conditions (Terms) apply to the purchase of the 
goods and/or services (Supplies) identified in a purchase order issued by 
Buyer to Seller which references these Terms.
 
    (b)           Parties
     
Buyer and Seller are identified on the face of the purchase order.
 
2.             The Terms of the Order
 
    (a)           Terms of the Order
     
The Order consists of the following, which are sometimes referred to 
collectively as the Terms of the Order: (i) the purchase order; (ii) 
Material Releases (as defined in Section 3(a)) issued by Buyer to Seller 
under the purchase order (iii) these Terms; (iv) all other documents 
specifically incorporated into or otherwise made a part of the Order by 
Buyer; and (v) Buyers purchase policies, as revised by Buyer and agreed to 
in writing by Seller from time to time. Seller is responsible for keeping 
current regarding the terms of Buyers purchase policies.
 
    (b)           Sellers Acceptance
     
The purchase order is an offer by Buyer to purchase the Supplies from 
Seller on the Terms of the Order. The contract is formed when Seller 
accepts the offer of Buyer. This occurs upon the earlier of: (i) Seller 
beginning work or performance based on the purchase order; or (ii) Seller 
notifying Buyer of its acceptance of the offer in writing. The Order is 
limited to and conditional upon Sellers acceptance of these Terms 
exclusively.
 
    (c)           Sellers Terms Rejected
     
The Order does not constitute an acceptance of any offer or proposal made 
by Seller, and Seller acknowledges that: (i) a request for quotation or 
similar document issued by Buyer is not an offer by Buyer; and (ii) any 
response by Seller to a request for quotation or similar document issued by 
Buyer is not an offer by Seller. Any additional or different terms proposed 
by Seller, whether in Sellers quotation, acknowledgement, invoice or 
otherwise, are unacceptable to Buyer, are expressly rejected by Buyer, and 
are not part of
 
1
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
the Order. However, additional or different terms proposed by Seller shall 
not operate as a rejection of the Order if Seller commences work or 
otherwise accepts Buyers offer, in which case the Order shall be deemed 
accepted by Seller without any additional or different terms or variations 
whatsoever. Any reference in the Order to any prior communication by Seller 
is solely to incorporate the description or specifications of the Supplies 
in such prior communication, but only to the extent that such description 
or specifications are not directly in conflict with the description and 
specifications in the Order. If the Order is determined to be an acceptance 
of any prior offer or proposal by Seller, such acceptance shall be limited 
to the Terms of the Order.
 
    (d)           Entire Agreement
     
The Order is the entire agreement between the parties respecting the 
Supplies and when accepted, supersedes any prior agreements, negotiations 
or understandings of the parties respecting the Supplies, whether written 
or oral. No modification shall be effective unless in writing and signed by 
Buyers and Sellers authorized representative. The Order may be modified 
only by a writing signed by Buyer and agreed to in writing by Seller.
 
3.             Quantity; Blanket Orders; Material Releases
 
    (a)           Releases
     
Unless specified differently in the Order, Seller shall deliver Supplies in 
strict conformance with the dates, times, quantities and delivery locations 
determined by Buyer and identified as firm orders in material authorization 
releases, manifests, broadcasts or similar releases (Material Releases). 
Time, quantities and location are of the essence under the Order and Seller 
shall provide 100% on-time delivery of the quantities and at the times 
specified by Buyer. Seller shall not make any commitments for raw materials

but excluding items with a value of $25.00 or less; supplier includes 
prospective, current and past suppliers; and favoritism means partiality

business with Buyer. Seller shall also comply with all ethics, fair 
business practices, non-discrimination and non-harassment policies of 
Buyer.
 
14.          Duration, Termination and Remedies
  
    (a)           Duration
     
The Order shall be effective on the date specified in the Order, or if no 
date is specified, when accepted. Unless otherwise specifically provided in 
the Order:
 
    (i)            The Order shall terminate on the date specified in the
    Order; or, if no date is specified, one year from the effective date.
    The termination date is not extended by an amendment or revision to an
    Order which does not expressly modify the termination date.
     
    (ii)           The Order will automatically renew for successive
    one-year periods after the initial term unless Seller provides written
    notice at least 90 days prior to the end of the current term of its
    desire that the Order not be renewed.
     
    (b)           Termination by Buyer
     
In addition to any other rights of Buyer to cancel or terminate the Order, 
Buyer may terminate the Order in whole or in part by written notice (a 
Termination Notice), as follows:
 
    (i)            For convenience, 60 days following delivery of the
    Termination Notice or upon such other date specified by Buyer in
    writing; and
     
    (ii)           For Default, effective upon delivery of the Termination
    Notice or upon such other date specified by Buyer in writing. Seller
    shall be in Default if it: (i) breaches any warranty or other Term of
    the Order; (ii) repudiates, breaches or threatens to breach any of the
    terms of the Order; (iii) fails to deliver, or threatens not to
    deliver, Supplies in connection with the Order; (iv) fails to make
    progress or to meet reasonable quality requirements so as to endanger
    timely and proper performance of the Order; (v) Seller makes an
    assignment for the benefit of creditors, or proceedings in bankruptcy
    or insolvency are instituted by or against Seller; (vi) Seller requests
    accommodations from Buyer, financial or otherwise, in order to meet its
    obligations under the Order; or (vii) at any time in Buyers sole
    judgment Sellers financial or other condition or progress on the Order
    shall be such as to endanger timely performance. Termination by Buyer
    shall not relieve Seller of any liability under the Order except as
    provided in these Terms.
 
14
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
    (c)           Suspension or Termination by Seller
     
Seller may terminate or suspend performance under an Order only for 
non-payment of the purchase price for Supplies which are 30 or more days 
past due and material in amount, and then only if: (i) Seller first 
provides Buyer written notice specifying the amounts past due and Sellers 
intent to terminate or suspend performance under the Order if the past due 
amount is not paid; and (ii) Buyer, within 30 days of such notice, does not 
either: (a) pay the past due amounts, or (b) notify Seller that the amount 
claimed to be unpaid is disputed by Buyer. Seller shall terminate or 
suspend under this Section by delivering a termination notice to Buyer. 
Seller may not suspend performance or terminate the Order for any reason 
except as permitted under this Section.
 
    (d)           Sellers Obligations Following Termination
     
Following delivery of a notice of termination, Seller shall, unless 
otherwise directed by Buyer and subject to its obligation to provide 
Transition Support as provided in Section (h) below;
 
    (i)            Terminate promptly all performance under the Order and
    transfer title and deliver to Buyer all finished Supplies completed
    prior to receipt of the Notice of Termination;
     
    (ii)           Transfer title and deliver to Buyer all work in process,
    and the parts and materials which Seller produced or acquired in
    accordance with an Order and which Seller cannot use in producing goods
    for itself or for others to the extent such use is permitted;
     
    (iii)          Verify/settle all claims by subcontractors for actual
    costs that are rendered unrecoverable by such termination and provided
    the recovery of materials in Sellers possession is ensured; and
     
    (iv)          Take actions reasonably necessary to protect property in
    Sellers possession in which Buyer has an interest until disposal
    instruction from Buyer has been received.
     
    (v)           Seller shall continue performance of an Order to the
    extent not terminated and shall be liable to Buyer for any excess costs
    for alternative products or services and other direct damages. As an
    alternative remedy, and in lieu of termination for default, Buyer, at
    its sole discretion, may elect: (i) to extend the delivery schedule;
    and/or (ii) to waive other deficiencies in Sellers performance; in
    which case an equitable reduction in an Order price shall be
    established by Buyer to compensate Buyer for its damages. If Seller for
    any reason anticipates difficulty in complying with a required delivery
    date, or in meeting any of the other requirements of an Order, Seller
    shall promptly notify
 
15
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
    Buyer in writing of the potential default, the cause thereof, and the
    estimated length of the anticipated default. Buyer is under no
    obligation to waive any default.
     
    (e)           Buyers Obligations Following Termination
     
Subject to Section (g)(ii), Buyer shall pay to Seller in connection with 
termination only the following amounts, without duplication, in complete 
and final satisfaction of any liabilities relating to the Order:
  
    (i)            The purchase price for all conforming Supplies received
    by Buyer prior to Notice of Termination or delivered following Notice
    of Termination pursuant to Sections (d)(i) or (h) or at the written
    direction of Buyer;
     
    (ii)           Any amounts owed for Transition Support pursuant to
    Section (h)(iii); and
     
    (iii)          If terminated for any reason other than Default by
    Seller, Sellers reasonable actual cost of: (i) merchantable and
    useable work- in-process and the parts and materials transferred to
    Buyer under Section (d)(ii) above (but not to exceed the Order price of
    the Supplies had the work been completed); (ii) settling claims under
    Section (d)(iii); and (c) carrying out its obligation under Section
    (d)(iv).
     
    (f)            Buyers Obligations Following Expiration
     
If the Order expires, Buyer shall pay to Seller, in complete and final 
satisfaction of any liabilities relating to the Order, only the purchase 
price for all conforming Supplies received by Buyer prior to expiration and 
all quantities listed as firm releases not otherwise purchased by Buyer, 
and, if applicable, any amounts owed for Transition Support pursuant to 
Section (h)(iii).
  
    (g)           Limitations on Buyers Obligations Following Termination
    or Expiration
  
    (i)            Buyers obligations under Section (e) are conditioned
    upon Sellers furnishing to Buyer, within 60 days after the date of
    termination (or such shorter period as may be required by its
    customer), a termination claim, which will consist exclusively of the
    items of Buyers obligation to Seller that are expressly permitted by
    this Section. Buyer may audit Sellers records before or after payment
    to verify amounts requested in Sellers termination claim.
     
    (ii)           Buyer has no obligation under Section (e) to make any
    payment for Supplies, work-in-process, parts or raw materials
    inventory: (i) in
 
16
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
    excess of those authorized or required under any firm Material Release; 
    (ii) that are damaged or destroyed or that are not merchantable or
    useable; (iii) that are in Sellers standard stock or that are readily
    marketable; or (iv) that can be returned to Sellers suppliers or
    subcontractors for credit.
     
    (iii)          Buyer has no obligation for and will not be required to
    pay Seller, directly or on account of claims by Sellers
    subcontractors, for loss of anticipated profit, failure to realize
    anticipated production volumes, revenues or savings, unabsorbed
    overhead, interest on claims, product development and engineering
    costs, Tooling, facilities and equipment rearrangement costs or rental,
    unamortized capital or depreciation costs, or general administrative
    burden charges from termination or expiration of the Order, except as
    otherwise expressly agreed in a separate Order issued by Buyer.
     
    (h)           Transition of Supplies Following Termination or
    Expiration
     
Following expiration or termination of the Order by either party for any 
reason (including termination by Seller) and notwithstanding any claimed or 
actual breach of any obligation by Buyer, Seller shall cooperate in the 
transition of supply to a successor supplier, including the following, 
which will collectively be referred to as Transition Support:
 
    (i)            Seller shall continue production and delivery of all
    Supplies as ordered by Buyer, at the prices and other terms stated in
    the Order, without premium or other condition, during the entire period
    reasonably needed by Buyer to complete the transition to the alternate
    supplier(s), so that Sellers action or inaction causes no interruption
    in Buyers ability to obtain Supplies as needed;
     
    (ii)           At no cost to Buyer, Seller will promptly provide all
    requested information and documentation regarding and access to
    Sellers manufacturing process, including on-site inspections,
    bill-of-material data, tooling and process detail and samples of
    Supplies and components; and
     
    (iii)          Subject to Sellers actual capacity constraints, Seller
    shall provide special overtime production, storage and/or management of
    extra inventory of Supplies, extraordinary packaging and transportation
    and other special services as expressly requested by Buyer in writing.
    If the transition occurs for reasons other than Sellers termination
    for Default, Buyer shall, at the end of the transition period, pay the
    reasonable, actual cost of the assistance under this Section
    14(h)(iii), provided that Seller has advised Buyer prior to incurring
    such amounts of its estimate of such costs. If the parties disagree on
    the cost of Transition Support, Buyer shall pay the agreed portion to
    Seller without prejudice to Sellers right to seek to recover any
    disputed amounts.
 
17
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
    (i)            Termination and Change of Control
 
Buyer may terminate an Order or Release, in whole or in part, upon 
reasonable written notice to Seller, if control of Seller changes. A change 
of control includes: (i) the sale, lease or exchange of a substantial 
portion of Sellers assets used for the production of the Supplies; (ii) 
the sale or exchange of a controlling interest in the shares or other 
ownership interests of Seller; or (iii) the execution of a voting or other 
agreement of control. Seller shall provide Buyer with written notices of a 
proposed and actual change of control at least ten days prior to the date 
the change of control is scheduled to occur and within ten days after the 
change of control has become effective. Buyer will have 30 days from the 
date the second notice from Seller is received within which to notify 
Seller if it decides to terminate the Order and the effective date of the 
termination, which will be no sooner than 30 days after the date the 
written notice of termination is sent.
 
    (j)            Duty to Deliver
     
Sellers continued holding of the Supplies, Buyers Property or Sellers 
Property (as defined herein), after demand has been made by Buyer for 
delivery, will substantially impair their value, and Buyer shall be 
entitled to a court order for possession without bond. Seller shall 
continue to sell Supplies under an Order during any dispute with Buyer 
provided Buyer continues to pay Seller amounts owed in excess of any right 
of offset.
 
    (k)           Recall
     
In the event of any safety, maintenance or improvement program, general 
recall or similar action (Recall) involving the Supplies which Buyer has 
determined do not meet requirements of the Order, whether initiated by 
Buyer, Seller, or any governmental agency or body, both Buyer and Seller 
shall use reasonable commercial efforts to reduce costs in connection with 
such Recall. If it shall be alleged or determined that failure of Supplies 
supplied by Seller to conform to Sellers warranty is a proximate cause of 
any Recall, Seller shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Buyer, its 
affiliates, subsidiaries, directors, officers, employees, agents and other 
representatives from and against all expenses and costs of such Recall. All 
Recalls shall be at the discretion of Buyer after consultation with Seller, 
except as ordered by a government agency or body. Sellers obligations 
related to Recalls shall continue to apply after the expiration of Sellers 
express warranties.
 
    (l)            Cumulative and Additional Remedies
     
Buyers remedies under this Section and the applicable law shall be 
cumulative and additional to any other or further remedies provided under 
the Order or by statute, law or equity, including, but not limited to, the 
recovery of direct damages and the entry of injunctive relief, but Buyer 
shall be entitled to only one full recovery of all of its damages and 
enforcement of all its rights.
 
18
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
    (m)          Restrictions on Waiver
 
A delay by Buyer in notification of a breach or making a claim shall not 
constitute a waiver of a breach or remedy. No waiver of a breach of any 
provision of the Order by Buyer shall constitute a waiver of any other 
breach, or of the breached provision itself. No claim or right of Buyer 
arising under, or related to, the Order can be discharged in whole or in 
part by a waiver or renunciation unless supported by additional 
consideration and in writing signed by Buyer.
 
    (n)           Sellers Remedy
     
Money damages, as limited by the Order, are Sellers exclusive remedy for 
breach of contract or other claim or theory. Seller may not allege breach 
of contract or other theory of recovery for such money damages without 
providing a written notice of breach, documentation supporting the claim, 
and a reasonable time for Buyer to cure any breach and otherwise resolve 
the claims.
 
    (o)           Remedial Work
     
If repair, sorting, inspection, or similar activities (Remedial Work) is 
necessary for any rejected Supplies, then Buyer may elect either to perform 
the Remedial Work itself or to have a third party perform it. In either 
case, the reasonable cost of such Remedial Work shall be either: (i) 
offset against the amounts otherwise due Seller for such rejected Supplies; 
or (ii) charged separately to Seller. Buyer may require that the Remedial 
Work be performed on the premises of Buyer or its Customer by Seller, in 
which case Buyer or its Customer shall provide Seller with reasonable 
access to its premises and otherwise assist Seller with such arrangements 
as are necessary to perform the Remedial Work. In performing Remedial Work 
or replacing rejected Supplies, Seller is responsible for segregating and 
sorting any applicable Supplies providing for transportation of the 
Supplies, supervising the segregation and removal of the Supplies, and 
other incidental activities, all at its sole cost. Remedial Work by Seller 
requires the prior written permission of Buyer and/or Buyers Customer.
 
    (p)           Rights of the Secured Party and DOE
     
The Secured Party and DOE may exercise any of the Buyers rights under this 
Section 14 and, subject to the provisions of Section 26, such exercise 
shall not result in the assumption of any of Buyers obligations hereunder.
 
15.          Buyers Property
 
    (a)           Buyers Property Defined
     
Buyers Property means any tangible or intangible property to which Buyer 
has title. Buyers Property includes:
 
19
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
    (i)            As provided in Section 4(c), Supplies, together with
    materials and components incorporated or to be incorporated in the
    Supplies;
     
    (ii)           All property which is furnished by Buyer, either
    directly or indirectly to Seller to perform the Order;
     
    (iii)          Intellectual Property Rights and Proprietary Information
    of Buyer, as specified in Sections 18 and 19;
     
    (iv)          Tooling (as defined herein) and other property
    (including, by way of example, returnable packaging) for which Buyer
    has paid, and
     
    (v)           Any modifications, repairs, refurbishments, and
    replacements of Buyers Property defined above.
     
    (b)                   Obligations of Seller
     
With respect to Buyers Property in the custody or control of Seller or 
Sellers suppliers, subcontractors or agents, Buyers Property shall, at 
Sellers cost and risk:
 
    (i)            Be used only for the production of Supplies for Buyer.
     
    (ii)           Be kept: (i) in good working condition house, maintain,
    repair and replace it, except for normal wear and tear; (ii) fully
    insured for the benefit of Buyer; and (iii) be kept segregated from all
    other assets and labeled as being the property of Buyer.
     
    (iii)          Bailment; Seller shall have only temporary possession as
    a bailee at will. Seller shall assure that Buyers Property is not
    released, relocated or delivered to any third party without the express
    written permission of Buyer. Seller shall promptly notify Buyer of the
    location of Buyers Property if located at any place other than
    Sellers facility.
     
    (iv)          Buyer, DOE and the Secured Party shall have the right to
    enter Sellers premises to inspect Buyers Property and all records of
    Seller and other third parties regarding Buyers Property. Only Buyer
    (or Buyers affiliates) and the Secured Party has any right, title or
    interest in Buyers Property, except for Sellers limited right,
    subject to Buyers sole discretion, to use Buyers Property in the
    provision of Supplies. Seller shall neither create nor allow to exist
    any liens on Buyers Property, and Seller shall immediately sign any
    documents reasonably required by Buyer to perfect all rights granted or
    confirmed by these Terms. Seller grants to Buyer, DOE and the Secured
    Party a limited and irrevocable power of attorney, coupled with an
    interest, to execute and record on Sellers behalf any documents with
    respect to Buyers Property that Buyer, DOE or the
 
20
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
    Secured Party determines are reasonably necessary to reflect Buyers or
    the Secured Partys interest in Buyers Property.
     
    (v)           Return; Unless instructed by Buyer to the contrary,
    immediately upon Buyers request or upon any bankruptcy or insolvency
    filing, and without payment of any kind, Seller shall return Buyers
    Property, and shall comply with Buyers instructions relating to its
    return, including but not limited to the method and location for its
    return. Seller is responsible for labor and other costs incidental to
    the return of Buyers Property. Seller shall cooperate with Buyer and
    shall provide Buyer with access to all facilities at which Buyers
    Property is located. Seller expressly waives any right to additional
    notice or process relating to Buyers exercise of its rights under this
    Section. Seller waives, to the extent permitted by law: (i) any lien or
    other rights that Seller might otherwise have on any of Buyers
    Property, including but not limited to molders and builders liens;
    and (ii) any objection to Buyers repossession and removal of Buyers
    Property for any or no reason, including bankruptcy or insolvency
    proceedings.
     
16.          Sellers Property
  
    (a)                   Definition
     
Sellers Property means all Tooling and other items that are not Buyers 
Property and that are necessary for the production of Supplies are Sellers 
Property.
 
    (b)                   Maintenance
     
Seller, at its expense, shall furnish, keep in good working condition 
capable of producing Supplies meeting all applicable specifications, and 
replace when necessary, all Sellers Property. Seller shall insure Sellers 
Property with full fire and extended coverage insurance for its replacement 
value. If Seller uses Sellers Property to produce goods or services 
similar to Supplies for other customers, including aftermarket customers, 
such goods or services will not incorporate any of Buyers logos, 
trademarks, trade names or part numbers. Seller shall not disclose or imply 
in its marketing efforts that such goods or services are equivalent to 
those purchased by Buyer.
 
    (c)                   Option to Purchase
     
Seller grants to Buyer an irrevocable option to take possession of and 
title to Sellers Property that is specific for the production of Supplies 
under the Order upon payment to Seller of its net book value less any 
amounts that Buyer has previously paid to Seller for the cost of such 
items. This option does not apply if Sellers Property is used to produce 
goods that are the standard stock of Seller or if a substantial quantity of 
like goods is being sold by Seller to other than Buyer.
 
21
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
17.          Tooling
 
    (a)                   Definition and Acquisition
     
Tooling means all Tooling, jigs, fixtures and other personal property other 
than capital equipment used in the manufacture of Supplies. Unless 
otherwise provided in this order, property of every description including 
all tools, equipment, material, drawings, manufacturing aids and 
replacements of the foregoing furnished by Buyer, either directly or 
indirectly, or as acquired or manufactured by Seller for use in the 
performance of this order, for which Seller has been reimbursed by Buyer 
(Special Tooling), will be: (i) the property of Buyer; and (ii) plainly 
marked or otherwise adequately identified by Seller as the property of 
Buyer. Seller shall not purchase any Tooling for the account of Buyer or 
charge Buyer for any tooling except as authorized in an Order.
 
    (b)                   Payment & Terms
     
If Buyer has agreed to compensate Seller for Tooling in an Order:
 
    (i)            The price for Tooling in the Order will be adjusted to
    credit Buyer in the amount, if any, by which the price exceeds Sellers
    actual cost as verified by Buyer. If Seller does not provide access and
    documentation necessary for Buyers verification, Buyer may determine
    in its reasonable discretion an appropriate adjustment. Seller shall
    retain all cost records for a period of two years after receiving final
    payment for Tooling. Seller shall provide to Buyer, as requested,
    access to Sellers premises and all documentation relating to the
    Tooling prior and subsequent to payment, to inspect work performed, and
    to verify charges submitted by Seller against the Order.
     
    (ii)           Seller shall be entitled to receive payment only after
    it is completed unless otherwise provided in the Order. Tooling is not
    complete until Seller, at its own expense, has successfully completed
    all required testing (including completion of the PPAP process) and has
    submitted all necessary documentation required by the Order.
     
    (iii)          Payment terms for Tooling shall be specified in the
    Order.
     
    (c)                   Warranty
     
If Seller is responsible for fabricating or acquiring Tooling, Seller 
warrants that such Tooling shall: (i) comply with any specifications 
provided by Buyer; and (ii) be capable of producing Supplies that satisfy 
the Order, including meeting any volume requirements or estimates provided 
to Seller during the life of the product as well as satisfying the 
requirements for Service Parts. Time is of the essence for Sellers 
acquisition or fabrication of Tooling. Seller shall provide Tooling 
progress reports on Buyers request
 
22
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
and shall promptly notify Buyer in writing if it believes that the Tooling 
might not be completed by the completion date specified on the Order.
 
    (d)                   Third Party Tool Makers
      
If all or part of the fabrication, modification, repair or refurbishment of 
Tooling will be subcontracted to a third-party toolmaker, Seller will: (i) 
give Buyer advance written notice of the identity of the toolmaker and the 
location of the Tooling;(ii) inform the toolmaker in writing that it is a 
bailee-at-will, through Seller, of Tooling owned by Buyer; and (iii) be 
solely responsible for payments to the toolmaker. Buyer has no obligation 
to Seller or subcontractor other than payment to Seller of the Order price. 
If a subcontractor brings an action against Seller for payment of the 
Tooling, Seller will not join Buyer in the action.
 
    (e)                   Bailment to Subcontractors
      
If Seller intends to subcontract all or part of the manufacture of the 
Supplies to a third- party subcontractor and to deliver Tooling to the 
subcontractors premises, Seller shall: (i) provide Buyer with prior 
written notice of the identity of the subcontractor and the location of the 
Tooling; (ii) obtain the written permission of Buyer in advance of Sellers 
delivery; (iii) inform the subcontractor in writing that it is a 
bailee-at-will, through Seller, of Tooling owned by Buyer; and (iv) be 
solely responsible for payments to the subcontractor.
 
18.          Intellectual Property
 
    (a)                   Warranty of Non-Infringement
      
Seller warrants that the Supplies and the sale and/or use thereof (before 
or after incorporation into products during manufacture) do not and will 
not infringe, misappropriate or violate any Intellectual Property Rights. 
Intellectual Property Right means all rights arising under U.S. or 
foreign law relating to patent, trademark, copyright, moral rights, 
industrial design right, Proprietary Information (as defined in Section 19) 
and trade secrets or other intellectual property rights.
 
    (b)                   Restriction on Use of Buyers Intellectual
    Property

    (c)                   License to Buyer
 
Seller grants to Buyer, its subsidiaries and affiliates, and their 
respective successors and assigns, and Buyer hereby accepts, a 
non-exclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free, fully paid up worldwide license, 
including the right to sublicense to others under: (i) any Intellectual 
Property Rights owned or controlled by Seller or its affiliates, and 
relating to the Supplies, to make, have made, repair, reconstruct, rebuild, 
relocate, use, sell and import the Supplies; and (ii) any works of 
authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression (including drawings, 
prints, manuals and specifications) furnished by Seller in the course of 
Sellers activity under Order, to reproduce, distribute and display such 
works and to prepare derivative works based thereon, subject to the other 
provisions of Order (all items in clauses (i) and (ii) above, collectively, 
Sellers Intellectual Property, and such license in respect thereof, the 
License). Seller acknowledges and understands that the License shall be 
effective from the first date of delivery of the Supplies under Order and 
extend for so long as Buyer has contractual obligations to any customer. 
The license is subject to 11 USC §365(n) and other Law, as an executory 
agreement under which Buyer has license rights to Sellers Intellectual 
Property, and is supplementary to any other rights of Buyer under the Order 
and any other agreement with Seller.
 
    (d)                   Ownership
     
Any developments or work product that are created by or on behalf of Seller 
in the performance of an Order, whether or not they may be protected by 
patent, copyright or otherwise, shall be work for hire and be the exclusive 
property of Buyer, and to the extent any such developments or work product 
do not qualify as work for hire, Seller assigns all rights in such 
developments or work product to Buyer and shall execute such further 
documents as may be necessary to record or otherwise enforce Buyers rights 
therein including patent, copyright, trademark or other intellectual 
property rights, and all related expenses shall be paid by Buyer. Seller 
hereby appoints Buyer as its attorney-in-fact to execute assignments of, 
and register all rights to, such developments and work product. Seller 
acknowledges that Buyer has a substantial interest in ensuring that the 
developments and work product are assigned to Buyer and that revocation of 
the appointment of attorney-in-fact would be inequitable.
 
    (e)                   Subcontractor Obligations
     
Seller shall ensure that the terms of its contracts with its subcontractors 
and employees are consistent with the terms of this Section.

disclose the confidential and proprietary information of Buyer or use such 
information for any purpose other than to perform its obligations under the 
Order. Seller shall safeguard the confidential and proprietary information 
of Buyer by using reasonable efforts, and in any event no less effort than 
Seller uses in the protection of its own proprietary information of a 
similar nature, to prevent its disclosure to third parties. Seller shall 
cause its employees, contractors, officers, directors, agents and 
representatives to be bound by and comply with the foregoing restrictions 
regarding the use or disclosure of such confidential and proprietary 
information. Seller shall not assert any claims with respect to any 
technical information which Seller shall have disclosed or may hereafter 
disclose to Buyer in connection with the Supplies.
 
    (b)                   Limitations on Buyers Information
     
The restrictions and obligations of Section 19(a) do not apply to 
information that: (i) is already publicly known at the time of its 
disclosure by Buyer; (ii) after disclosure by Buyer becomes publicly known 
through no fault of Seller; or (iii) Seller can establish by written 
documentation was properly in its possession prior to disclosure by Buyer 
or was independently developed by Seller without use of or reference to 
Buyers information. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these 
Terms, any confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement between the parties 
that predates the Order will remain in effect except as expressly modified 
by the Order, and to the extent of a conflict between the express terms of 
such an agreement and this Section, the terms of that agreement will 
control.
 
    (c)                   Ownership

licensed to do business in the state, province, and country where Buyer 
shall use and sell the Supplies. Liability coverage shall include products, 
completed operations and (if available) recall. Buyer, each Credit Provider 
and the Secured Party shall be named as an additional insured under the

29
------------------------------------------------------------------------

loans and other credit extensions to be made from time to time by DOE, FFB

and agrees to execute such additional consents and waivers as the Secured 
Party (or its representative) may reasonably request in order to evidence 
and perfect the Secured Partys lien. Seller also agrees to notify the 
Secured Party prior to exercising any right it might have to suspend or

well as to exercise all of the other rights of Buyer under the Order. DOE 
and the Secured Party (or their representatives) and Buyer shall each be 
entitled to exercise all rights of Buyer under the Order unless the Secured 
Party notifies Seller that such rights may only be exercised by DOE, the 
Secured Party and their representatives. Should the Secured Party (or its 
representative) exercise its right to foreclose upon its security interest 
in the Order, it may transfer all of Buyers rights and obligations under
