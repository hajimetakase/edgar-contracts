3.17 Information
 
a. 	

In connection with this Agreement, including Suppliers performance of its 
obligations hereunder and AT&Ts receipt of Material and Services, either 
Party may find it beneficial to disclose to the other Party (which may 
include permitting or enabling the other Partys access to) certain of its 
Information. For the purpose of this clause, AT&Ts disclosure of 
Information to Supplier includes any Information that Supplier receives, 
observes, collects, handles, stores, or accesses, in

 
Proprietary and Confidential
This Agreement and information contained therein is not for use or 
disclosure outside of AT&T, its Affiliates, and third
party representatives, and Supplier except under written agreement by the 
contracting parties.

Agreement 20071210.103.A.002
 
  	

any way, in connection with this Agreement. Likewise, Suppliers disclosure 
of Information to AT&T includes any Information that AT&T receives, 
observes, collects, handles, stores, or accesses, in any way, in connection 
with this Agreement. Information of a disclosing Party shall be deemed to 
be confidential or proprietary only if it is clearly marked or otherwise 
identified by the disclosing Party as being confidential or proprietary, 
provided that if it is orally or visually disclosed (including Information 
conveyed to an answering machine, voice mail box or similar medium), the 
disclosing Party shall designate it as confidential or proprietary at the 
time of such disclosure. Not withstanding the foregoing, a disclosing Party 
shall not have any such obligation to so mark or identify, or to so 
designate, Information that the disclosing Party discloses to or is 
otherwise obtained by the other Partys employees, contractors, or 
representatives (i) who are located on the disclosing Partys premises; 
(ii) who access the disclosing Partys systems; or (iii) who otherwise 
obtain AT&T and/or AT&T Customer Information in connection with this 
Agreement, any such Information so disclosed shall automatically be deemed 
to be confidential and proprietary. Additionally, the failure to mark or 
designate information as being confidential or proprietary will not waive 
the confidentiality where it is reasonably obvious, under the circumstances 
surrounding disclosure, that the Information is confidential or 
proprietary; any such Information so disclosed or obtained shall 
automatically be deemed to be confidential and proprietary. For greater 
certainty, Information provided by either Party to the other Party prior to 
the Effective Date of this Agreement in connection with the subject matter 
hereof, including any such Information provided under a separate 
non-disclosure agreement (howsoever denominated) is also subject to the 
terms of this Agreement. Neither Party shall disclose Information under 
this Agreement that includes, in any form, any of the following: customer 
or employee personal information, credit card and credit related 
information, financial information, and/or authentication credentials.

 
b. 	With respect to the Information of the disclosing Party, the receiving 
Party shall:


1. hold all such Information in confidence with the same degree of care 
with which it protects its own confidential or proprietary Information, but 
with no less than reasonably prudent care;


2. restrict disclosure of such Information solely to its employees, 
contractors, and agents with a need to know such Information, advise such 
persons of their confidentiality obligations hereunder with respect 
thereto, and ensure that such persons are bound by obligations of 
confidentiality reasonably comparable to those imposed in this Agreement;


3. use such Information only as needed to perform its obligations (and, if 
AT&T is the receiving Party, to receive the benefits of the Material and 
Services provided) under this Agreement;


4. except as necessary under clause (3), not copy, distribute, or otherwise 
use any such Information or allow anyone else to copy, distribute, or 
otherwise use such Information; and ensure that any and all copies bear the 
same notices or legends, if any, as the originals; and


5. upon the disclosing Partys request, promptly return, or destroy all or 
any requested portion of the Information, including tangible and electronic 
copies, notes, summaries, extracts, mail or other communications, and 
provide written certification within fifteen (15) business days to the 
disclosing Party that such Information has been returned or destroyed, 
provided that with respect to archival or back-up copies of Information 
that reside on the receiving Partys systems, the receiving Party shall be 
deemed to have complied with its obligations under this clause (5) if it 
makes reasonable efforts to expunge from such systems, or to permanently 
render irretrievable, such copies.
 
Proprietary and Confidential
This Agreement and information contained therein is not for use or 
disclosure outside of AT&T, its Affiliates, and third
party representatives, and Supplier except under written agreement by the 
contracting parties.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Agreement 20071210.103.A.002
 

 
c. 	Neither Party shall have any obligation to the other Party with respect 
to Information which:


1. at the time of disclosure was already known to the receiving Party free 
of any obligation to keep it confidential (as evidenced by the receiving 
Partys written records prepared prior to such disclosure);


2. is or becomes publicly known through no wrongful act of the receiving 
Party (such obligations ceasing at the time such Information becomes 
publicly known);


3. is lawfully received from a third party, free of any obligation to keep 
it confidential;


4. is independently developed by the receiving Party or a third party, as 
evidenced by the receiving Partys written records, and wherein such 
development occurred without any direct or indirect use of or access to the 
Information received from the disclosing Party, or


5. the disclosing Party consents in writing to be free of restriction.
 
d. 	If a receiving Party is required to provide Information of a disclosing 
Party to any court or government agency pursuant to a written court order, 
subpoena, regulatory demand, or process of law, the receiving Party must, 
unless prohibited by applicable law, first provide the disclosing Party 
with prompt written notice of such requirement and reasonable cooperation 
to the disclosing Party should it seek reasonable protective arrangements 
for the production of such Information. The receiving Party will (i) take 
reasonable steps to limit any such provision of Information to the specific 
Information required by such court or agency, and (ii) continue to 
otherwise protect all Information disclosed in response to such order, 
subpoena, regulation, or process of law.
 
e. 	A receiving Partys obligations with respect to any particular 
Information of a disclosing Party shall remain in effect, including after 
the expiration, Termination or Cancellation of this Agreement, until such 
time as it qualifies under one of the exceptions set forth in clause (3) 
above.


10. Section 3.18, Infringement, shall be deleted and replaced as follows:

Parties against any Loss resulting from, arising out of or relating to any 
allegation, threat, demand, claim or lawsuit (Claim) of:
 
  	1. 	infringement of any patent, copyright, trade mark, service mark, 
trade secret, or other intellectual property right (including, for 
avoidance of doubt, direct, contributory and active inducement 
infringement) in connection with the Materials or Services, including, for 
example, any Claim of infringement based on:
 
  	a. 	making, repair, receipt, use, importing, sale or disposal (and 
offers to do any of the foregoing) of Materials and Services, or
 
  	b. 	use of Materials and Services in combination with products, systems,

example, use in the form of the making or using of an apparatus or system, 
or the making or practicing of a process or method (a Combination Claim).
 
  	2. 	misappropriation of any trade secret, proprietary or non-public 
information in connection with the Materials and Services;

(any such Loss referenced in sections 1 or 2 of this paragraph b.i, a 
Covered Loss regardless of whether such Claim is meritorious).
 
  	ii. 	In the event (and only in the event) that Suppliers obligations 
under paragraph b.i result from, arise out of, or relate to a Combination 
Claim, the following provisions shall apply:
 
  	1. 	Supplier shall be liable to pay only its Proportionate Share of the 
Covered Loss associated with such Combination Claim. The Proportionate 
Share payable by Supplier shall be a portion of the Covered Loss

Combination Claim.
 
  	2. 	Supplier shall be liable to the Indemnified Parties (or to a third 
party claimant directly, if applicable) for its duly determined 
Proportionate Share of the Covered Loss with respect to a particular

obligation, if any, relating to the Combination Claim.

  	3. 	Supplier shall make payments in satisfaction of its Proportionate 
Share obligation (Proportionate Share Payments) whenever those 
Proportionate Share Payments become due (for example, Supplier shall make 
Proportionate Share Payments for indemnified defense costs when payment is 
due to be paid to outside counsel; and Supplier will make Proportionate 
Share Payments for court awards (such as damages) when payment is required 
by the court; and Supplier will make Proportionate Share Payments for 
settlement when payment is due to be paid according to the terms of a 
settlement agreement). Supplier shall be liable to the Indemnified Parties 
for any monies owed (such as a Proportionate Share) by any of Suppliers 
affiliates should such affiliates fail to pay in accordance with its 
indemnification obligation to the Indemnified Parties.
 
  	4. 	The Indemnified Parties shall select a single lead counsel to defend 
such Combination Claim and Supplier agrees to share authority and control 
over the defense of any such Combination Claim with the Indemnified Parties 
and other interested parties.
 
  	iii. 	In the event (and only in the event) that Suppliers obligations 
under paragraph b.i result from, arise out of, or relate to other than a 
Combination Claim, and the Claim against the Indemnified Parties concerns 
products or services (including the Materials or Services) provided by more 
than one Supplier, the following provisions shall apply:
 
  	1. 	Supplier agrees that it will cooperate reasonably with the 
Indemnified Parties and other Suppliers who have provided products or 
services to the Indemnified Parties, each of which products or services is 
also subject to the Claim (Other Suppliers) in order to defend the 
Indemnified Parties in a coordinated effort.
 
  	2. 	AT&T shall select a single lead counsel to defend such Claim and 
Supplier agrees to share authority and control over the defense of any such 
Claim with the Indemnified Parties and Other Suppliers.
 
  	3. 	Supplier shall be liable to pay only its Associated Share of the 
Loss which is equal to the Loss multiplied by a fraction equal to the net 
amount paid by the Indemnified Parties to Supplier for the applicable 
Material and Services divided by the total aggregate net amount paid by the 
Indemnified Parties to all Suppliers for products or services that are 
involved in the Claim.
 
  	4. 	Supplier shall make payments in satisfaction of its Associated Share 
obligation (Associated Share Payments) whenever those Associated Share 
Payments become due (for example, Supplier shall make Associated Share 
Payments for indemnified defense costs when payment is due to be paid to 
outside counsel; and Supplier will make Associated Share Payments for court

Agreement 20071210.103.A.002
 

 
c. 	Continued Use of Materials and Services Subject to Non-Combination 
Claims.
 
  	i. 	If, as a result of a third party claim other than an Combination 
Claim, (i) Indemnified Parties rights under this Agreement are restricted 
or diminished; or (ii) an injunction is sought or is likely (in Suppliers 
judgment) to be issued against the Indemnified Parties use of Materials 
and Services, or (iii) Material or Services are likely (in Suppliers 
judgment) to become the subject of a claim of infringement, then, in 
addition to its other obligations set forth in this Section, Supplier, in 
any case at its sole expense and at no loss, cost or damage to the 
Indemnified Parties or their customers, shall obtain for the Indemnified 
Parties the right to continue using or conducting other activities with 
respect to (as the case may be) the Materials or Services; provided that if 
Supplier is unable to obtain such right, Supplier shall, after consulting 
with and obtaining the written approval of the Indemnified Parties, provide 
modified or replacement non-infringing Materials or Services that are 
equally suitable and functionally equivalent while retaining the quality of 
the original Materials or Services.
 
  	ii. 	Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the 
contrary, should an injunction be issued against any person (whether or not 
stayed or currently in effect), based on a claim other than a Combination 
Claim, affecting Indemnified Parties ability to use or conduct other 
activities with respect to the Materials and Services, then the Indemnified 
Parties may seek the right to continue to use, or conduct other activities 
with respect to, the Materials and Services, and Supplier shall reimburse 
the Indemnified Parties for the costs (including reasonable attorneys 
fees) associated with obtaining such right; provided however that Supplier 
shall be responsible for costs associated with use or activities with 
respect to the Materials and Services only and not any other products or 
services used by the Indemnified Parties.
 
d. 	Elimination of Charges. AT&T has no obligation to pay Supplier any 
charges under this Agreement for the purchase, use, or maintenance of 
Materials or Services after such time as the Indemnified Parties cease to 
use them, by reason of actual or claimed infringement.
 
e. 	Procedures Relating to Indemnification. The Parties shall follow the 
procedures respecting indemnification provided in the Section entitled 
Indemnity. In the event of any conflict between this Section 3.18 and the 
Section entitled Indemnity, the provisions of this Section 3.18 shall 
prevail.
 
f. 	Forbidden Settlements. In no event shall Supplier settle any 
Combination Claim or other Claim in whole or in part in a manner that would 
amount to Supplier paying less than its determined Proportionate Share or 
Associated Share, or that would otherwise negatively impact AT&T in a 
material way (relative to a similar settlement by any other participating 
parties).

to AT&T to the full extent allowed by such OEM warranties.
 
b. 	Supplier warrants that Services provided hereunder will be performed in

g. 	Supplier warrants that all Material provided to AT&T hereunder shall be 
tested prior to Delivery to ensure that all Material is in strict

commence upon Acceptance by AT&T.
 
i. 	If at any time during the warranty period for Material or Services AT&T

shall either (i) repair or replace the Material or reperform the Services 
so as to correct the breach of warranty at no cost to AT&T, (ii) accept the 
return of the Material and provide AT&T with a full refund for the 
defective Materials or Services; or (iii) credit AT&T with a mutually

transit with respect to all Materials returned for repair, replacement, or

to AT&T, and all repaired and replacement Materials are warranted as 
provided in this Section. If AT&T elects to have Supplier repair or replace 
the Material or reperform the Services so as to correct the breach of 
warranty, and Supplier fails to do so, then, in addition to its other 
remedies under the law, this Agreement or an Order, AT&T may itself repair 
the Material or correct the Services, or engage a third party to do so, in 
either case at Suppliers expense.

Agreement. AT&T agrees and approves wireless carriers and long distance 
carriers as subcontractors and Supplier shall not be responsible in any way

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Agreement 20071210.103.A.002
 

 
b. 	Supplier shall pay any penalty, interest, additional tax, or other 
charge that may be levied or assessed as a result of the delay or failure 
of Supplier, for any reason, to pay any tax or file any return or 
information required by law, rule or regulation or by this Agreement to be 
paid or filed by Supplier.
 
c. 	Upon AT&Ts request, the Parties shall consult with respect to the 
basis and rates upon which Supplier shall pay any taxes or fees for which 
AT&T is obligated to reimburse Supplier under this Agreement. If AT&T 
determines that in its opinion any such taxes or fees are not payable, or 
should be paid on a basis less than the full price or at rates less than 
the full tax rate, AT&T shall notify Supplier in writing of such 
determinations, Supplier shall make payment in accordance with such 
determinations, and AT&T shall be responsible for such determinations. If 
collection is sought by the taxing authority for a greater amount of taxes 
than that so determined by AT&T, Supplier shall promptly notify AT&T. If 
AT&T desires to contest such collection, AT&T shall promptly notify 
Supplier. Supplier shall cooperate with AT&T in contesting such 
determination, but AT&T shall be responsible and shall reimburse Supplier 
for any tax, interest, or penalty in excess of AT&Ts determination.
 
d. 	If AT&T determines that in its opinion it has reimbursed Supplier for 
any taxes in excess of the amount that AT&T is obligated to reimburse 
Supplier, AT&T and Supplier shall consult to determine the appropriate 
method of recovery of such excess reimbursements. Supplier shall credit any 
excess reimbursements against tax reimbursements or other payments due from 
AT&T if and to the extent Supplier can make corresponding adjustments to 
its payments to the relevant tax authority. At AT&Ts request, Supplier 
shall timely file any claims for refund and any other documents required to 
recover any other excess reimbursements, and shall promptly remit to AT&T 
all such refunds and interest received.
 
e. 	If any taxing authority advises Supplier that it intends to audit 
Supplier with respect to any taxes for which AT&T is obligated to reimburse 
Supplier under this Agreement, Supplier shall (i) promptly so notify AT&T, 
(ii) afford AT&T an opportunity to participate on an equal basis with 
Supplier in such audit with respect to such taxes and (iii) keep AT&T fully 
informed as to the progress of such audit. Each Party shall bear its own 
expenses with respect to any such audit, and the responsibility for any 
additional tax, interest or penalty resulting from such audit is to be 
determined in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Taxes 
Section. Suppliers failure to comply with the notification requirements of 
this Taxes Section will relieve AT&T of its responsibility to reimburse 
Supplier for taxes only if Suppliers failure materially prejudiced AT&Ts 
ability to contest imposition or assessment of those taxes.
 
f. 	In addition to its rights under Subsections c., d., and e. above with 
respect to any tax or tax controversy covered by this Taxes Section, AT&T 
is entitled to contest, pursuant to applicable law and tariffs, and at its 
own expense, any tax previously invoiced that it is ultimately obligated to 
pay. AT&T is entitled to the benefit of any refund or recovery of amounts 
that it has previously paid resulting from such a contest. Supplier shall 
cooperate in any such contest, but AT&T shall pay all costs and expenses 
incurred in obtaining a refund or credit for AT&T.
 
g. 	If either Party is audited by a taxing authority or other governmental 
entity in connection with taxes under this Taxes Section, the other Party 
shall reasonably cooperate with the Party being audited in order to respond 
to any audit inquiries in an appropriate and timely manner, so that the 
audit and any resulting controversy may be resolved expeditiously.

Agreement 20071210.103.A.002
 

 
h. 	AT&T and Supplier shall reasonably cooperate with each other with 
respect to any tax planning to minimize taxes. The degree of cooperation 
contemplated by this section is to enable any resulting tax planning to be 
implemented and includes, but is not limited to: (i) Suppliers installing 
and loading all of the Software licensed by AT&T, and retaining possession 
and ownership of all tangible personal property, (ii) Supplier installing, 
loading and/or transferring the Software at a location selected by AT&T, 
and (iii) Supplier Delivering all of the Software in electronic form. AT&T 
shall bear all reasonable external (paid to third parties), additional 
expenses incurred by Supplier to comply with the provisions of this 
subsection, but AT&Ts advance written consent is required whenever these 
expenses for any Software item or update are expected to exceed two 
thousand dollars ($2,000) or one percent (1%) of the cost of the item or 
update, whichever is less. Suppliers cooperation is not an agreement with, 
or guarantee of, the taxability or non-taxability of the transaction.

consideration of criminal convictions in making employment decisions.
 
b. 	Supplier shall comply with the obligations of subsections (b) and (c) 
above through the use of a third party service which shall perform a review 
of applicable records for those counties, states, and federal court 
districts in which a proposed Supplier Person has identified as having 
resided, worked, or attended school in the previous ten (10) years, unless 
a shorter period is required by any federal, state, or local law.

Agreement 20071210.103.A.002
 

 
c. 	Supplier acknowledges and agrees that it is Suppliers sole and 
exclusive responsibility to determine whether a Supplier Person with a 
Conviction should be denied Access during the term of the Agreement under 
the terms of this Agreement and in compliance with all federal, state, and 
local laws, unless an exception is granted by AT&T under paragraph e. of 
this Section.
 
d. 	Supplier represents and warrants to AT&T that, to the best of its 
knowledge, no Supplier Person has (i) falsified any of his or her 
Identification Credentials, or (ii) failed to disclose any material 
information in the hiring process relevant to the performance of any 
Service. Supplier shall not permit any Supplier Person who has falsified 
such Identification Credentials or failed to disclose such information to 
perform any Service that permits Access.
 
e. 	The following definitions apply:
 
  	1. 	Identification Credentials includes, with respect to each Supplier 
Person, his or her Social Security number, drivers license, educational 
credentials, employment history, home address, and citizenship indicia.
 
  	2. 	Drug Screen means the testing for the use of illicit drugs 
(including opiates, cocaine, cannabinoids, amphetamines, and phencyclidine 
(PCP)) of any Supplier Person who (i) has unsupervised (or badged) physical 
Access to AT&Ts or its customers premises, or (ii) has regular or 
recurring supervised physical Access to AT&Ts or its customers premises 
for more than thirty (30) days in the aggregate annually.
 
f. 	The failure of Supplier to comply with the requirements of this 
Section, and/or if any Person who fails such Background Check or who has 
falsified Identification Credentials does perform any Service that permits 
such Access, shall each be considered a material breach of this Agreement. 
Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, exceptions for individual Supplier 
Persons may be granted by AT&T on a case-by-case basis.


The terms and conditions of Agreement No. 20071210.103.C in all other

Amendment may be executed in multiple counterparts, each of which shall be 
deemed to constitute an original but all of which together shall constitute 
only one document.


IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties have caused this Amendment to Agreement No. 
20071210.103.C to be executed, as of the date the last Party signs.
