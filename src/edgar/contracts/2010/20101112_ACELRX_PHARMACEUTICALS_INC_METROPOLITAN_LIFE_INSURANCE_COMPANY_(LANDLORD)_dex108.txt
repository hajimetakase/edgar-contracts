------------------------------------------------------------------------


 
(h)       Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this 
Section 4.01, as to each specific category of Operating Expense which one 
or more tenants of the Building either pays directly to third parties or 
specifically reimburses to Landlord (for example, separately contracted 
janitorial services or property taxes directly reimbursed to Landlord), 
then, on a category by category basis, the amount of Operating Expenses for 
the affected period shall be adjusted as follows: (1) all such tenant 
payments with respect to such category of expense and all of Landlords 
costs reimbursed thereby shall be excluded from Operating Expenses and 
Tenants Building Share, Tenants Phase Share or Tenants Project Share, as

by excluding the square footage of all such tenants, and (2) if Tenant pays 
or directly reimburses Landlord for such category of Operating Expense,

(b)       Any Rent Adjustments due in excess of the Rent Adjustment 
Deposits in accordance with Section 4.03.
 
4.03       	STATEMENT OF LANDLORD


Within one hundred twenty (120) days after the end of each calendar year or 
as soon thereafter as reasonably possible, Landlord will furnish Tenant a 
statement (Landlords Statement) showing the following:


(a)       Operating Expenses for the last Adjustment Year showing in 
reasonable detail the actual Operating Expenses categorized among Project 
Operating Expenses, Building Operating Expenses and Phase Operating 
Expenses for such period and Tenants Share of each as described in Section

months preceding any such change pursuant to Landlords Statement.


Tenant shall pay to Landlord within thirty (30) days after receipt of such 
statement any amounts for Rent Adjustments then due in accordance with 
Landlords Statement. Any amounts due from Landlord to Tenant pursuant to 
this Section shall be credited to the Rent Adjustment Deposit next coming 
due, or refunded to Tenant if the Term has already expired provided Tenant 
is not in default hereunder. No interest or penalties shall accrue on any 
amounts which Landlord is obligated to credit or refund to Tenant by reason 
of this Section 4.03. Landlords failure to deliver Landlords Statement or 
to compute the amount of the Rent Adjustments shall not constitute a waiver 
by Landlord of its right to deliver such items nor constitute a waiver or 
release of Tenants obligations to pay such amounts. The Rent Adjustment 
Deposit shall be credited against Rent Adjustments due for the applicable 
Adjustment Year. During the last complete calendar year or during any 
partial calendar year in which the Lease terminates, Landlord may include 
in the Rent Adjustment Deposit its estimate of Rent Adjustments which may 
not be finally determined until after the termination of this Lease. 
Tenants obligation to pay Rent Adjustments survives the expiration or 
termination of the Lease.
 
4.04       	BOOKS AND RECORDS

business in the state in which the Property is located and whose primary 
business is certified public accounting) shall have the right, for a period 
of ninety (90) days following the date upon which Landlords Statement is 
delivered to Tenant, to examine the Landlords books and records with 
respect to the items in the foregoing statement of Operating Expenses and 
Taxes during normal business hours, upon written notice, delivered at least 
three (3) business days in advance. If Tenant does not object in writing to 
Landlords Statement within one hundred twenty (120) days of Tenants 
receipt thereof, specifying the nature of the item in dispute and the 
reasons therefor, then Landlords Statement shall be considered final and 
accepted by Tenant. Any amount due to the Landlord as shown on Landlords 
Statement, whether or not disputed by Tenant as provided herein shall be 
paid by Tenant when due as provided above, without prejudice to any such 
written exception.

4.05       	TENANT OR LEASE SPECIFIC TAXES


In addition to Monthly Base Rent, Rent Adjustments, Rent Adjustment 
Deposits and other charges to be paid by Tenant, Tenant shall pay to 
Landlord, upon demand, any and all taxes payable by Landlord (other than 
federal or state inheritance, general income, gift or estate taxes) whether 
or not now customary or within the contemplation of the parties hereto: (a) 
upon, allocable to, or measured by the Rent payable hereunder, including 
any gross receipts tax or excise tax levied by any governmental or taxing 
body with respect to the receipt of such rent; or (b) upon or with respect 
to the possession, leasing, operation, management, maintenance, alteration, 
repair, use or occupancy by Tenant of the Premises or any portion thereof; 
or (c) upon the measured value of Tenants personal property or trade 
fixtures located in the Premises or in any storeroom or any other place in 
the Premises or the Property, or the areas used in connection with the 
operation of the Property, it being the intention of Landlord and Tenant 
that, to the extent possible, Tenant shall cause such taxes on personal 
property or trade fixtures to be billed to and paid directly by Tenant; (d) 
resulting from Landlord Work, Tenant Work or Tenant Alterations to the 
Premises, whether title thereto is in Landlord or Tenant; or (e) upon this 
transaction. Taxes paid by Tenant pursuant to this Section 4.05 shall not 
be included in any computation of Taxes as part of Operating Expenses.


ARTICLE FIVE
SECURITY


  (a)       Tenant, at Tenants sole cost and expense, shall provide 
Landlord, simultaneously with Tenants execution and delivery of this Lease 
to Landlord, with the Letter of Credit (defined below) and Tenant shall 
pay Landlord in immediately available funds the cash amount of the Security 
specified in Section 1.01 as security (Security) for the full and 
faithful performance by Tenant of each and every term, provision, covenant, 
and condition of this Lease. If Tenant fails timely to perform any of the 
terms, provisions, covenants and conditions of this Lease or any other 
document executed by Tenant in connection with this Lease, including, but 
not limited to, the payment of Rent or the repair of damage to the Premises 
caused by Tenant (excluding normal wear and tear), beyond any applicable 
notice and cure period, then Landlord may use, apply, or retain the whole 
or any part of the Security for the payment of any Rent not paid when due, 
for the cost of repairing such damage, for the cost of cleaning the 
Premises, for the payment of any other sum which Landlord may expend or may 
be required to expend by reason of Tenants failure to perform, and 
otherwise for compensation of Landlord for any other loss or damage to 
Landlord occasioned by Tenants failure to perform, including, but not 
limited to, any loss of future Rent and any damage or deficiency in the 
reletting of the Premises (whether such loss, damages or deficiency accrue 
before or after summary proceedings or other reentry by Landlord) and the 
amount of the unpaid past Rent, future Rent loss, and all other losses, 
costs and damages, that Landlord would be entitled to recover if Landlord 
were to pursue recovery under Section 11.02(b) or (c) of this Lease or 
California Civil Code Section 1951.2 or 1951.4 (and any supplements, 
amendments, replacements and substitutions thereof and therefor from time 
to time). If Landlord so uses, applies or retains all or part of the 
Security, Tenant shall within five (5) business days after demand pay or 
deliver to Landlord in immediately available funds the sum necessary to 
replace the amount used, applied or retained. If Tenant has fully and 
faithfully performed and observed all of Tenants obligations under the 
terms, provisions, covenants and conditions of this Lease, the Security 
(except any amount retained for application by Landlord as provided herein) 
shall be returned or paid over to Tenant no later than ninety (90) days 
after the latest of: (i) the Termination Date; (ii) the removal of Tenant 
from the Premises; (iii) the surrender of the Premises by Tenant to 
Landlord in accordance with this Lease; or (iv) the date Rent Adjustments 
owed pursuant to this Lease have been computed by Landlord and paid by 
Tenant. Provided, however, in no event shall any such return be construed 
as an admission by Landlord that Tenant has performed all of its 
obligations hereunder.


  (b)       The Security, whether in the form of cash, Letter of Credit 
and/or Letter of Credit Proceeds (defined below), shall not be deemed an 
advance rent deposit or an advance payment of any kind, or a measure of 
Landlords damages with respect to Tenants failure to perform, nor shall 
any action or inaction of Landlord with respect to it or its use or 
application be a waiver of, or bar or defense to, enforcement of any right 
or remedy of Landlord. Landlord shall not be required to keep the Security 
separate from its general funds and shall not have any fiduciary duties or 
other duties (except as set forth in this Section) concerning the Security. 
Tenant shall not be entitled to any interest on the Security. In the event 
of any sale, lease or transfer of Landlords interest in the Building, 
Landlord shall have the right to transfer the Security, or balance thereof, 
to the vendee, transferee or lessee and any such transfer shall release 
Landlord from all liability for the return of the Security. Tenant 
thereafter shall look solely to such vendee, transferee or lessee for the 
return or payment of the Security. Tenant shall not assign or encumber or 
attempt to assign or encumber the Security or any interest in it and 
Landlord shall not be bound by any such assignment, encumbrance, attempted 
assignment or attempted encumbrance, and regardless of one or more 
assignments of this Lease, Landlord may return the Security to the original 
Tenant without liability to any assignee. Tenant hereby waives any and all 
rights of Tenant under the provisions of Section 1950.7 of the California 
Civil Code, and any and all rights of Tenant under all provisions of law, 
now or hereafter enacted, regarding security deposits.


  (c)       If Tenant fails timely to perform any obligation under this 
Article Five, such breach shall constitute a Default by Tenant under this 
Lease without any right to or requirement of any further notice or cure 
period under any other Article of this Lease, except such notice and cure 
period expressly provided under this Article Five.


  (d)       As used herein, Letter of Credit shall mean an unconditional, 
irrevocable sight draft letter of credit issued, presentable and payable at 
the San Francisco, San Francisco Peninsula or San Jose office of a major 
national bank satisfactory to Landlord in its sole discretion (the Bank), 
naming Landlord as beneficiary, in an amount equal to One Hundred Fifty 
Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($150,000.00). The Letter of Credit shall 
provide: (i) that Landlord may make partial and multiple draws thereunder, 
up to the face amount thereof, and that Landlord may draw upon the Letter 
of Credit up to the full amount thereof, as determined by Landlord, and the 
Bank will pay to Landlord the amount of such draw upon receipt by the Bank 
of a sight draft signed by Landlord without requirement for any additional 
documents or statements by Landlord; and (ii) that, in the event of 
assignment or other transfer of either Landlords interest in this Lease or 
of any interest in Landlord (including, without limitation, consolidations, 
mergers, reorganizations or other entity changes), the Letter of Credit 
shall be freely transferable by Landlord, without charge and without 
recourse, to the assignee or transferee of such interest and the Bank shall 
confirm the same to Landlord and such assignee or transferee. The Letter of 
Credit shall be in the form attached as Exhibit E hereto. Landlord may (but 
shall not be required to) draw upon the Letter of Credit and use the 
proceeds therefrom (the Letter of Credit Proceeds) or any portion thereof 
in any manner Landlord is permitted to use the Security under this Article 
Five. In the event Landlord draws upon the Letter of Credit and elects not 
to terminate the Lease, but to use the Letter of Credit Proceeds, then 
within ten (10) business days after Landlord gives Tenant written notice 
specifying the amount of the Letter of Credit Proceeds so utilized by 
Landlord, Tenant shall immediately deliver to Landlord an amendment to the 
Letter of Credit or a replacement Letter of Credit in an amount equal to 
one hundred percent (100%) of the then-required amount of the Letter of 
Credit. Tenants failure to deliver such amendment or replacement of the 
Letter of Credit to Landlord within ten (10) business days after Landlords 
notice shall constitute a Default by Tenant under this Lease. The Letter of 
Credit shall have an initial term of no longer than one (1) year, shall be 
evergreen, and shall be extended, reissued or replaced by Tenant, in each 
case at least thirty (30) days prior to its expiration in a manner that 
fully complies with the requirements of this Article Five, so that in all 
events the Letter of Credit required hereunder shall be in full force and 
effect continuously until the date (the L/C Expiration Date) for return 
of the Security described in Subsection (a) above. No more often than once 
per year, Landlord shall have the right to require Tenant to deliver to 
Landlord, on 15 days prior notice, a replacement Letter of Credit on the 
same terms and conditions set forth in this Article Five, in the event that 
Landlord determines, in its good faith judgment, that the issuing Bank is 
no longer satisfactory to remain as the issuer of the Letter of Credit. Any 
advice from the issuer that it intends to withdraw or not extend the Letter 
of Credit prior to any scheduled annual expiration or the L/C Expiration 
Date shall entitle the Landlord to immediately draw upon the Letter of 
Credit.

ARTICLE SIX
UTILITIES & SERVICES
 
6.01       	LANDLORDS GENERAL SERVICES


Landlord shall provide maintenance and services as provided in Article 
Eight.
 
6.02       	TENANT TO OBTAIN & PAY DIRECTLY


  (a)       Tenant shall be responsible for and shall pay promptly all 
charges for gas, electricity, sewer, heat, light, power, telephone, refuse 
pickup (to be performed on a regularly scheduled basis so that accumulated 
refuse does not exceed the capacity of Tenants refuse bins), janitorial 
service and all other utilities, materials and services furnished directly 
to or used by Tenant in, on or about the Premises, together with all taxes 
thereon. Tenant shall contract directly with the providing companies for 
such utilities and services.


  (b)       Notwithstanding any provision of the Lease to the contrary, 
without, in each instance, the prior written consent of Landlord, as more 
particularly provided in Article Nine, Tenant shall not: (i) make any 
alterations or additions to the electric or gas equipment or systems or 
other Building systems. Tenants use of electric current shall at no time 
exceed the capacity of the wiring, feeders and risers providing electric 
current to the Premises or the Building. The consent of Landlord to the 
installation of electric equipment shall not relieve Tenant from the 
obligation to limit usage of electricity to no more than such capacity.
 
6.03       	TELEPHONE SERVICES


All telegraph, telephone, and communication connections which Tenant may 
desire outside the Premises shall be subject to Landlords prior written 
approval, in Landlords sole discretion, and the location of all wires and 
the work in connection therewith shall be performed by contractors approved 
by Landlord and shall be subject to the direction of Landlord, except that 
such approval is not required as to Tenants cabling from the Premises in a 
route designated by Landlord to any telephone cabinet or panel provided for 
Tenants connection to the telephone cable serving the Building, so long as 
Tenants equipment does not require connections different than or 
additional to those to the telephone cabinet or panel provided. As to any 
such connections or work outside the Premises requiring Landlords 
approval, Landlord reserves the right to designate and control the entity 
or entities providing telephone or other communication cable installation, 
removal, repair and maintenance outside the Premises and to restrict and 
control access to telephone cabinets or panels. In the event Landlord 
designates a particular vendor or vendors to provide such cable 
installation, removal, repair and maintenance for the Building, Tenant 
agrees to abide by and participate in such program. Tenant shall be 
responsible for and shall pay all costs incurred in connection with the 
installation of telephone cables and communication wiring in the Premises, 
including any hook-up, access and maintenance fees related to the 
installation of such wires and cables in the Premises and the commencement 
of service therein, and the maintenance thereafter of such wire and cables; 
and there shall be included in Operating Expenses for the Building all 
installation, removal, hook-up or maintenance costs incurred by Landlord in 
connection with telephone cables and communication wiring serving the 
Building which are not allocable to any individual users of such service 
but are allocable to the Building generally. If Tenant fails to maintain 
all telephone cables and communication wiring in the Premises and such 
failure affects or interferes with the operation or maintenance of any 
other telephone cables or communication wiring serving the Building, 
Landlord or any vendor hired by Landlord may enter into and upon the 
Premises forthwith and perform such repairs, restorations or alterations as 
Landlord deems necessary in order to eliminate any such interference (and 
Landlord may recover from Tenant all of Landlords costs in connection 
therewith). No later than the Termination Date, Tenant agrees to remove all 
telephone cables and communication wiring installed by Tenant for and 
during Tenants occupancy, which Landlord shall request Tenant to remove. 
Tenant agrees that neither Landlord nor any of its agents or employees 
shall be liable to Tenant, or any of Tenants employees, agents, customers 
or invitees or anyone claiming through, by or under Tenant, for any 
damages, injuries, losses, expenses, claims or causes of action because of 
any interruption, diminution, delay or discontinuance at any time for any 
reason in the furnishing of any telephone or other communication service to 
the Premises and the Building, except that Landlord shall be responsible 
for repair or replacement of damage or destruction to Tenants telephone 
equipment and wiring to the extent caused by the gross negligence or 
willful and wrongful act of Landlord or its employees or agents, but 
subject to the waivers set forth in Section 16.04.

6.04       	FAILURE OR INTERRUPTION OF UTILITY OR SERVICE


To the extent that any equipment or machinery furnished or maintained by 
Landlord outside the Premises is used in the delivery of utilities directly 
obtained by Tenant pursuant to Section 6.02 and breaks down or ceases to 
function properly, Landlord shall use reasonable diligence to repair same 
promptly. In the event of any failure, stoppage or interruption of, or 
change in, any utilities or services supplied by Landlord which are not 
directly obtained by Tenant, Landlord shall use reasonable diligence to 
have service promptly resumed. In either event covered by the preceding two 
sentences, if the cause of any such failure, stoppage or interruption of, 
or change in, utilities or services is within the control of a public 
utility, other public or quasi-public entity, or utility provider outside 
Landlords control, notification to such utility or entity of such failure, 
stoppage or interruption and request to remedy the same shall constitute 
reasonable diligence by Landlord to have service promptly resumed. In the 
event of any failure, stoppage or interruption of, or change in, any 
utility or other service furnished to the Premises or the Project resulting 
from any cause, including changes in service provider or Landlords 
compliance with any voluntary or similar governmental or business 
guidelines now or hereafter published or any requirements now or hereafter 
established by any governmental agency, board or bureau having jurisdiction 
over the operation of the Property: (a) Landlord shall not be liable for, 
and Tenant shall not be entitled to, any abatement or reduction of Rent; 
(b) no such failure, stoppage, or interruption of any such utility or 
service shall constitute an eviction of Tenant or relieve Tenant of the 
obligation to perform any covenant or agreement of this Lease to be 
performed by Tenant; (c) Landlord shall not be in breach of this Lease nor 
be liable to Tenant for damages or otherwise. Notwithstanding any other 
provision of this Section to the contrary, in the event and to the extent 
that the Premises is rendered untenantable and Tenant is unable to occupy 
the Premises or some portion thereof for five (5) consecutive business days 
after Tenant has given Landlord written notice of such condition (the 
Eligibility Period) as a result of Landlords negligent failure, or 
willful and wrongful failure, to provide or perform utilities, services or 
repairs which Landlord is obligated to provide or perform under this Lease, 
but excluding any period occupancy is prevented to the extent caused by any 
of the following: (i) any negligence or willful misconduct of Tenant, any 
assignee, any subtenant or any other occupant of the Premises, or of any 
employee, agent or invitee of any of them; (ii) request by Tenant or any 
assignee that Landlord make a repair, decoration, alteration, improvement 
or addition; or (iii) Force Majeure, then Monthly Base Rent and Rent 
Adjustments shall be abated for the period Tenant is so prevented from 
occupying the Premises, or on a pro-rated basis if Tenant is so prevented 
from occupying only part of Premises, commencing as of the first day after 
the Eligibility Period and continuing for such time that Tenant is 
prevented from occupying the Premises or such part.
 
6.05       	CHOICE OF SERVICE PROVIDER


Tenant acknowledges that Landlord may, at Landlords sole option, to the 
extent permitted by applicable law, elect to change, from time to time, the 
company or companies which provide services (including electrical service, 
gas service, water, telephone and technical services) to the Property, the 
Premises and/or its occupants. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set 
forth in this Lease, Tenant acknowledges that Landlord has not and does not 
make any representations or warranties concerning the identity or 
identities of the company or companies which provide services to the 
Property and the Premises or its occupants and Tenant acknowledges that the 
choice of service providers and matters concerning the engagement and 
termination thereof shall be solely that of Landlord. The foregoing 
provision is not intended to modify, amend, change or otherwise derogate 
from any provision of this Lease concerning the nature or type of service 
to be provided or any specific information concerning the amount thereof to 
be provided. Tenant agrees to cooperate with Landlord and each of its 
service providers in connection with any change in service or provider.
 
6.06       	SIGNAGE


Tenant shall not install any signage within the Project, the Building or 
the Premises without obtaining the prior written approval of Landlord, and 
Tenant shall be responsible for procurement, installation, maintenance and 
removal of any such signage installed by Tenant, and all costs in 
connection therewith. Any such signage shall comply with Landlords current 
Project signage criteria and all Laws.


ARTICLE SEVEN
POSSESSION, USE AND CONDITION OF PREMISES
 
7.01       	POSSESSION AND USE OF PREMISES


              (a)       Tenant shall occupy and use the Premises only for 
the uses specified in Section 1.01(17) to conduct Tenants business. Tenant 
shall not occupy or use the Premises (or permit the use or occupancy of the 
Premises) for any purpose or in any manner which: (1) is unlawful or in 
violation of any Law or Environmental Law; (2) may be dangerous to persons 
or property or which may invalidate, any policy of insurance carried on the 
Building or Project or covering its operations or which may increase the 
cost of any such insurance or insurance carried by any other occupant of 
the Project unless such increase is paid by Tenant; (3) is contrary to or 
prohibited by the terms and conditions of this Lease or the rules and 
regulations as provided in Article Eighteen; (4) contrary to or prohibited 
by the articles, bylaws or rules of any owners association affecting the 
Project; (5) is improper, immoral, or objectionable; (6) would obstruct or 
interfere with the rights of other tenants or occupants of the Building or 
the Project, or injure or annoy them, or would tend to create or continue a 
nuisance; or (7) would constitute any waste in or upon the Premises or 
Project.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 
(b)       Landlord and Tenant acknowledge that the Americans With 
Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. §12101 et seq.) and regulations and 
guidelines promulgated thereunder, as all of the same may be amended and 
supplemented from time to time (collectively referred to herein as the 
ADA) establish requirements for business operations, accessibility and 
barrier removal, and that such requirements may or may not apply to the 
Premises, the Building and the Project depending on, among other things: 
(1) whether Tenants business is deemed a public accommodation or 
commercial facility, (2) whether such requirements are readily 
achievable, and (3) whether a given alteration affects a primary function 
area or triggers path of travel requirements. The parties hereby agree 
that: (a) Landlord shall be responsible for ADA Title III compliance in the 
Common Areas, except as provided below, (b) Tenant shall be responsible for 
ADA Title III compliance in the Premises, including any leasehold 
improvements or other work to be performed in the Premises under or in 
connection with this Lease, (c) Landlord may perform, or require that 
Tenant perform, and Tenant shall be responsible for the cost of, ADA Title 
III path of travel requirements triggered by Tenant Additions in the 
Premises, and (d) Landlord may perform, or require Tenant to perform, and 
Tenant shall be responsible for the cost of, ADA Title III compliance in 
the Common Areas necessitated by the Building being deemed to be a public 
accommodation instead of a commercial facility as a result of Tenants 
use of the Premises. To the extent Tenant shall occupy the entire Building 
or an entire floor in the Building, all ADA Title III requirements relating 
to the restrooms, elevator lobbies and corridors on such floor shall be the 
responsibility of Tenant. In such event, all matters related to life 
safety on such floor shall also be the responsibility of Tenant. Tenant 
shall be solely responsible for requirements under Title I of the ADA 
relating to Tenants employees.


  (c)       Landlord and Tenant agree to cooperate and use commercially 
reasonable efforts to participate in traffic management programs generally 
applicable to businesses located in or about the area and Tenant shall 
encourage and support van and car pooling by, and staggered and flexible 
working hours for, its office workers and service employees to the extent 
reasonably permitted by the requirements of Tenants business. Neither this 
Section or any other provision of this Lease is intended to or shall create 
any rights or benefits in any other person, firm, company, governmental 
entity or the public.


  (d)       Tenant agrees to cooperate with Landlord and to comply with any 
and all guidelines or controls concerning energy management imposed upon 
Landlord by federal or state governmental organizations or by any energy 
conservation association to which Landlord is a party or which is 
applicable to the Building.
 
7.02       	HAZARDOUS MATERIAL


              (a)       Tenant shall not use, generate, manufacture, 
produce, store, handle, release, discharge, or dispose of, on, under or 
about the Premises or any part of the Project, or transport to or from the 
Premises or any part of the Project, any Hazardous Material or allow any 
Tenant Parties (defined below) to do so, except as expressly permitted 
below, without the prior written consent of Landlord, which may be withheld 
in Landlords sole discretion. For purposes of this Lease, Tenant Parties 
shall mean all occupants or users of the Premises permitted or suffered by 
Tenant, or the employees, servants, agents, contractors, customers or 
invitees of Tenant or of any such occupants or users. Provided that the 
Premises are used only for the uses specified in Section 1.01 and Section 
7.01 above, the foregoing prohibition shall not prohibit Tenant from using 
and storing in, and transporting to and from, the Premises, the types and 
amounts of Hazardous Material as specified on Exhibit D hereto and by this 
reference incorporated herein (Permitted Hazardous Material) and 
insignificant amounts of Hazardous Material typically used in general 
business office applications (to the extent the Premises is used for 
general offices) so long as (i) such substances are used in accordance with 
the manufacturers instructions therefor and all applicable Laws, (ii) such 
substances are not used or disposed of in or about the Building or the 
Project in a manner which would constitute a release or discharge thereof, 
and (iii) all Hazardous Material is removed from the Building and the 
Project by Tenant no later than the Termination Date. If Tenant desires to 
add additional types or quantities of Hazardous Materials to the list of 
Permitted Hazardous Materials specified in Exhibit D, Tenant shall give 
Landlord notice of the Hazardous Materials and quantities thereof that 
Tenant desires to use at the Premises and Landlord shall thereafter have 
the right to approve or disapprove such additional Hazardous Materials in 
Landlords sole discretion within twenty (20) days after receipt of such 
notice. Failure to notify Tenant in writing of its decision within said 
twenty (20) day period shall be deemed disapproval by Landlord. Whether or 
not Landlord approves any such request for changes, Tenant shall pay 
Landlord, within ten (10) days after request by Landlord, the actual fees 
and expenses of any consultants retained by Landlord in connection with 
review of the proposed changes in Permitted Hazardous Material. Tenant 
shall, within fifteen (15) days after demand therefor, deliver to Landlord 
a written list identifying any Hazardous Material then maintained by Tenant 
in the Building, the use of each such Hazardous Material so maintained by 
Tenant together with written certification by Tenant stating, in substance, 
that neither Tenant nor any Tenant Parties has released or discharged any 
Hazardous Material in or about the Building or the Project. Tenant shall, 
within fifteen (15) days after demand therefor, deliver to Landlord a copy 
of: (x) all permits, licenses and other governmental and regulatory 
approvals with respect to the use, generation, manufacture, production, 
storage, handling, release, discharge, removal and disposal by Tenant or 
Any of the Tenant Parties of Hazardous Material at the Project; and (y) 
each hazardous material management plan or similar document (Plan(s)) 
with respect to use, generation, manufacture, production, storage, 
handling, release, discharge, removal or disposal of Hazardous Material by 
Tenant or any of the Tenant Parties necessary to comply with Environmental 
Laws or other Laws prepared by or on behalf of Tenant or any of the Tenant 
Parties (whether or not required to be submitted to a governmental agency). 
Tenant shall comply with all Environmental Laws pertaining to Tenants 
occupancy and use of the Premises and concerning the proper storage, 
handling and disposal of any Hazardous Material introduced to the Premises, 
the Building or the Property by Tenant or any Tenant Parties. Landlord 
shall comply with all Environmental Laws applicable to the Property other 
than those to be complied with by Tenant pursuant to the preceding 
sentence. In the event that Tenant is notified of any investigation or 
violation of any Environmental Law arising from Tenants activities at the 
Premises, Tenant shall immediately deliver to Landlord a copy of such 
notice. In such event or in the event Landlord reasonably believes that a 
violation of Environmental Law exists, Landlord may conduct such tests and 
studies relating to compliance by Tenant with Environmental Laws or the 
alleged presence of Hazardous Material upon the Premises as Landlord deems 
desirable, all of which shall be completed at Tenants expense. To the 
extent permitted by Law, Tenant hereby indemnifies, and agrees to protect, 
defend and hold the Indemnitees harmless, against any and all actions, 
claims, demands, liability, costs and expenses, including attorneys fees 
and expenses for the defense thereof, arising out of any and all of (i) the 
introduction, use, discharge or release of any Hazardous Material into, in 
or about the Project by Tenant or any Tenant Parties, including any injury 
to or death of persons or damage to or destruction of property resulting 
therefrom, and (ii) any failure of Tenant or any Tenant Parties to observe 
the covenants of this Section 7.02. In case of any action or proceeding 
brought against the Indemnitees by reason of any such claim, upon notice 
from Landlord, Tenant covenants to defend such action or proceeding by 
counsel chosen by Landlord, in Landlords sole discretion. Landlord 
reserves the right to settle, compromise or dispose of any and all actions, 
claims and demands related to the foregoing indemnity. If any Hazardous 
Material is released, discharged or disposed of on or about the Property 
and such release, discharge or disposal is not caused by Tenant or any 
Tenant Parties, such release, discharge or disposal shall be deemed 
casualty damage under Article Fourteen to the extent that the Premises are 
affected thereby; in such case, Landlord and Tenant shall have the 
obligations and rights respecting such casualty damage provided under such 
Article.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 
  (b)       The right to use and store in, and transport to and from, the 
Premises the Permitted Hazardous Material is personal to AcelRx 
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and may not be assigned or 
otherwise transferred by AcelRx Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Delaware 
corporation, without the prior written consent of Landlord, which consent 
may be withheld in Landlords sole discretion, except (i) to a Permitted 
Transferee which is an assignee of the Lease and which has satisfied the 
requirements of Sections 10.01 and 10.05 of this Lease; and (ii) AcelRx may 
permit a Permitted Transferee which is a sublessee to use and store in, and 
transport to and from, the Premises the Permitted Hazardous Material to the 
same extent as AcelRx has such right under this Lease, subject to all the 
provisions of this Lease. . Any consent by Landlord pursuant to Article Ten 
to an assignment, transfer, subletting, mortgage, pledge, hypothecation or 
encumbrance of this Lease, and any interest therein or right or privilege 
appurtenant thereto, shall not constitute consent by Landlord to the use or 
storage at, or transportation to, the Premises of any Hazardous Material 
(including a Permitted Hazardous Material) by any such assignee, sublessee 
or transferee unless Landlord expressly agrees otherwise in writing. 
Provided however, at the time Tenant requests approval of any proposed 
assignment or sublease of this Lease by Tenant, and the assignee or 
sublessee desires to use Hazardous Materials, Tenant shall submit to 
Landlord the proposed Permitted Hazardous Material list of the proposed 
assignee or sublessee. Landlord shall have the right, in its sole 
discretion, to approve the proposed assignees or sublessees proposed 
Permitted Hazardous Material list, or to require modifications to said 
list. In the event that Landlord does not approve of the proposed 
assignees or sublessees Permitted Hazardous Material list, or the 
proposed assignee or sublessee cannot or will not modify said list, then it 
shall be reasonable for purposes of Article Ten hereof for Landlord to 
refuse its consent to the proposed assignment or sublease. In the event 
that the proposed Hazardous Material list of the assignee or sublessee 
includes any Hazardous Material different from or in greater quantity than 
Tenants Permitted Hazardous Material, Tenant shall pay Landlord, whether 
or not Landlord consents to the proposed list of Permitted Hazardous 
Material and/or to the proposed assignment or sublease, (i) a processing 
fee of Three Thousand Dollars ($3,000.00) at the time Tenant submits the 
request for approval, and (ii) within ten (10) days after request by 
Landlord, the actual fees and expenses of any consultants retained by 
Landlord in connection with review of the proposed Permitted Hazardous 
Material list and use thereof by the proposed assignee or sublessee. Any 
consent by Landlord to the use or storage at, or transportation to or from 
the Premises, of any Hazardous Material (including a Permitted Hazardous 
Material) by an assignee, sublessee or transferee of Tenant shall not 
constitute a waiver of Landlords right to refuse such consent as to any 
subsequent assignee or transferee.


  (c)       Tenant acknowledges that the sewer piping at the Project is 
made of ABS plastic. Accordingly, without Landlords prior written consent, 
which may be given or withheld in Landlords reasonable discretion, only 
ordinary domestic sewage is permitted to be put into the drains at the 
Premises. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL Tenant EVER DEPOSIT ANY ESTERS OR 
KETONES (USUALLY FOUND IN SOLVENTS TO CLEAN UP PETROLEUM PRODUCTS) IN THE 
DRAINS AT THE PREMISES. If Tenant desires to put any substances other than 
ordinary domestic sewage into the drains, it shall first submit to Landlord 
a complete description of each such substance, including its chemical 
composition, and a sample of such substance suitable for laboratory 
testing. Landlord shall promptly determine whether or not the substance can 
be deposited into the drains and its determination shall be absolutely 
binding on Tenant. Upon demand, Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for 
expenses incurred by Landlord in making such determination. If any 
substances not so approved hereunder are deposited in the drains in 
Tenants Premises, Tenant shall be liable to Landlord for all damages 
resulting therefrom, including but not limited to all costs and expenses 
incurred by Landlord in repairing or replacing the piping so damaged.
 
7.03       	LANDLORD ACCESS TO PREMISES; APPROVALS


  (a)       Tenant shall permit Landlord to erect, use and maintain pipes, 
ducts, wiring and conduits in and through the Premises, so long as Tenants 
use, layout or design of the Premises is not materially affected or 
altered. Landlord or Landlords agents shall have the right to enter upon 
the Premises in the event of an emergency, or to inspect the Premises, to 
perform janitorial and other services (if any), to conduct safety and other 
testing in the Premises and to make such repairs, alterations, improvements 
or additions to the Premises or the Building or other parts of the Property 
as Landlord may deem necessary or desirable (including all alterations, 
improvements and additions in connection with a change in service provider 
or providers). Janitorial and cleaning services (if any) shall be performed 
after normal business hours. Any entry or work by Landlord may be during 
normal business hours and Landlord may use reasonable efforts to ensure 
that any entry or work shall not materially interfere with Tenants 
occupancy of the Premises.


  (b)       If Tenant shall not be personally present to permit an entry 
into the Premises when for any reason an entry therein shall be necessary 
or permissible, Landlord (or Landlords agents), after attempting to notify 
Tenant (unless Landlord believes an emergency situation exists), may enter 
the Premises without rendering Landlord or its agents liable therefor, and 
without relieving Tenant of any obligations under this Lease.
 
13

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 
  (c)       Landlord may enter the Premises for the purpose of conducting 
such inspections, tests and studies as Landlord may deem desirable or 
necessary to confirm Tenants compliance with all Laws and Environmental 
Laws or for other purposes necessary in Landlords reasonable judgment to 
ensure the sound condition of the Property and the systems serving the 
Property. Landlords rights under this Section 7.03 (c) are for Landlords 
own protection only, and Landlord has not, and shall not be deemed to have 
assumed, any responsibility to Tenant or any other party as a result of the 
exercise or non-exercise of such rights, for compliance with Laws or 
Environmental Laws or for the accuracy or sufficiency of any item or the 
quality or suitability of any item for its intended use.


  (d)       Landlord may do any of the foregoing, or undertake any of the 
inspection or work described in the preceding paragraphs without such 
action constituting an actual or constructive eviction of Tenant, in whole 
or in part, or giving rise to an abatement of Rent by reason of loss or 
interruption of business of the Tenant, or otherwise.


  (e)       The review, approval or consent of Landlord with respect to any 
item required or permitted under this Lease is for Landlords own 
protection only, and Landlord has not, and shall not be deemed to have 
assumed, any responsibility to Tenant or any other party, as a result of 
the exercise or non-exercise of such rights, for compliance with Laws or 
Environmental Laws or for the accuracy or sufficiency of any item or the 
quality or suitability of any item for its intended use.
 
7.04       	QUIET ENJOYMENT


Landlord covenants, in lieu of any implied covenant of quiet possession or 
quiet enjoyment, that so long as Tenant is not in Default in compliance 
with the covenants and conditions set forth in this Lease, Tenant shall 
have the right to quiet enjoyment of the Premises without hindrance or 
interference from Landlord or those claiming through Landlord, and subject 
to the covenants and conditions set forth in the Lease and to the rights of 
any Mortgagee or ground lessor.


ARTICLE EIGHT
MAINTENANCE
 
8.01       	LANDLORDS MAINTENANCE


Subject to Article Fourteen and Section 8.02, Landlord shall maintain, in a 
manner compatible with maintenance of comparable properties in the 
immediate vicinity of the Project, the structural portions of the Building, 
the roof, exterior walls and exterior doors, foundation, and underslab 
standard sewer system of the Building in good, clean and safe condition, 
and shall use reasonable efforts, through Landlords program of regularly 
scheduled preventive maintenance, to keep the Buildings standard heating, 
ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) equipment in reasonably good 
order and condition. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Landlord shall have no 
responsibility to repair the Buildings standard heating, ventilation and 
air conditioning equipment, and all such repairs shall be performed by 
Tenant pursuant to the terms of Section 8.02. Landlord shall also (a) 
maintain the landscaping, parking facilities and other Common Areas of the 
Project, and (b) wash the outside of exterior windows at intervals 
determined by Landlord. Except as provided in Section 6.04, Article 
Fourteen and Article Fifteen, there shall be no abatement of rent, no 
allowance to Tenant for diminution of rental value and no liability of 
Landlord by reason of inconvenience, annoyance or any injury to or 
interference with Tenants business arising from the making of or the 
failure to make any repairs, alterations or improvements in or to any 
portion of the Project or in or to any fixtures, appurtenances or equipment 
therein. Tenant waives the right to make repairs at Landlords expense 
under any law, statute or ordinance now or hereafter in effect.
 
8.02       	TENANTS MAINTENANCE


Subject to the provisions of Article Fourteen, Tenant shall, at Tenants 
sole cost and expense, make all repairs to the Premises and fixtures 
therein which Landlord is not required to make pursuant to Section 8.01, 
including repairs to the interior walls, ceilings and windows of the 
Premises, the interior doors, Tenants signage, and the electrical, 
life-safety, plumbing and heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems 
located within or serving the Premises and shall maintain the Premises, the 
fixtures and utilities systems therein, and the area immediately 
surrounding the Premises (including all garbage enclosures), in a good, 
clean and safe condition. Tenant shall deliver to Landlord a copy of any 
maintenance contract entered into by Tenant with respect to the Premises. 
Tenant shall also, at Tenants expense, keep any non-standard heating, 
ventilating and air conditioning equipment and other non-standard equipment 
in the Building in good condition and repair, using contractors approved in 
advance, in writing, by Landlord. Notwithstanding Section 8.01 above, but 
subject to the waivers set forth in Section 16.04, Tenant will pay for any 
repairs to the Building or the Project which are caused by any negligence 
or carelessness, or by any willful and wrongful act, of Tenant or its 
assignees, subtenants or employees, or of the respective agents of any of 
the foregoing persons, or of any other persons permitted in the Building or 
elsewhere in the Project by Tenant or any of them. Tenant will maintain the 
Premises, and will leave the Premises upon termination of this Lease, in a 
safe, clean, neat and sanitary condition.


ARTICLE NINE
ALTERATIONS AND IMPROVEMENTS
 
9.01       	TENANT ALTERATIONS


  (a)       The following provisions shall apply to the completion of any 
Tenant Alterations:


        (1)       Tenant shall not, except as provided herein, without the 
prior written consent of Landlord, which consent shall not be unreasonably 
withheld, make or cause to be made any Tenant Alterations in or to the 
Premises or any Property systems serving the Premises. Prior to making any 
Tenant Alterations, Tenant shall give Landlord ten (10) days prior written 
notice (or such earlier notice as would be necessary pursuant to applicable 
Law) to permit Landlord sufficient time to post appropriate notices of 
non-responsibility. Subject to all other requirements of this Article Nine, 
Tenant may undertake Decoration work without Landlords prior written 
consent. Tenant shall furnish Landlord with the names and addresses of all 
contractors and subcontractors and copies of all contracts. All Tenant 
Alterations shall be completed at such time and in such manner as Landlord 
may from time to time designate, and only by contractors or mechanics 
approved by Landlord, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, 
provided, however, that Landlord may, in its sole discretion, specify the 
engineers and contractors to perform all work relating to the Buildings 
systems (including the mechanical, heating, plumbing, security, 
ventilating, air-conditioning, electrical, communication and the fire and 
life safety systems in the Building). The contractors, mechanics and 
engineers who may be used are further limited to those whose work will not 
cause or threaten to cause disharmony or interference with Landlord or 
other tenants in the Building and their respective agents and contractors 
performing work in or about the Building. Landlord may further condition 
its consent upon Tenant furnishing to Landlord and Landlord approving prior 
to the commencement of any work or delivery of materials to the Premises 
related to the Tenant Alterations such of the following as specified by 
Landlord: architectural plans and specifications, opinions from Landlords 
engineers stating that the Tenant Alterations will not in any way adversely 
affect the Buildings systems, necessary permits and licenses, certificates 
of insurance, and such other documents in such form reasonably requested by 
Landlord. Landlord may, in the exercise of reasonable judgment, request 
that Tenant provide Landlord with appropriate evidence of Tenants ability 
to complete and pay for the completion of the Tenant Alterations such as a 
performance bond or letter of credit. Upon completion of the Tenant 
Alterations, Tenant shall deliver to Landlord an as-built mylar and 
digitized (if available) set of plans and specifications for the Tenant 
Alterations.
 
14

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 
(2)       Tenant shall pay the cost of all Tenant Alterations and the cost 
of decorating the Premises and any work to the Property occasioned thereby. 
Except for the construction administration fee for the Tenant Work (which 
shall be as set forth in Section 8,10 of the Workletter), in connection 
with completion of any Tenant Alterations, Tenant shall pay Landlord a 
construction fee and all elevator and hoisting charges at Landlords then 
standard rate. Upon completion of Tenant Alterations, Tenant shall furnish 
Landlord with contractors affidavits and full and final waivers of lien 
and receipted bills covering all labor and materials expended and used in 
connection therewith and such other documentation reasonably requested by 
Landlord or Mortgagee.


(3)       Tenant agrees to complete all Tenant Alterations (i) in 
accordance with all Laws, Environmental Laws, all requirements of 
applicable insurance companies and in accordance with Landlords standard 
construction rules and regulations, and (ii) in a good and workmanlike 
manner with the use of good grades of materials. Tenant shall notify 
Landlord immediately if Tenant receives any notice of violation of any Law 
in connection with completion of any Tenant Alterations and shall 
immediately take such steps as are necessary to remedy such violation. In 
no event shall such supervision or right to supervise by Landlord nor shall 
any approvals given by Landlord under this Lease constitute any warranty by 
Landlord to Tenant of the adequacy of the design, workmanship or quality of 
such work or materials for Tenants intended use or of compliance with the 
requirements of Section 9.01(a)(3)(i) and (ii) above or impose any 
liability upon Landlord in connection with the performance of such work.


  (b)       All Tenant Additions to the Premises whether installed by 
Landlord or Tenant, shall without compensation or credit to Tenant, become 
part of the Premises and the property of Landlord at the time of their 
installation and shall remain in the Premises, unless pursuant to Article 
Twelve, Tenant may remove them or is required to remove them at Landlords 
request.
 
9.02       	LIENS


Tenant shall not permit any lien or claim for lien of any mechanic, laborer 
or supplier or any other lien to be filed against the Building, the Land, 
the Premises, or any other part of the Property arising out of work 
performed, or alleged to have been performed by, or at the direction of, or 
on behalf of Tenant. If any such lien or claim for lien is filed, Tenant 
shall within ten (10) days of receiving notice of such lien or claim (a) 
have such lien or claim for lien released of record or (b) deliver to 
Landlord a bond in form, content, amount, and issued by surety, 
satisfactory to Landlord, indemnifying, protecting, defending and holding 
harmless the Indemnitees against all costs and liabilities resulting from 
such lien or claim for lien and the foreclosure or attempted foreclosure 
thereof. If Tenant fails to take any of the above actions, Landlord, in 
addition to its rights and remedies under Article Eleven, without 
investigating the validity of such lien or claim for lien, may pay or 
discharge the same and Tenant shall, as payment of additional Rent 
hereunder, reimburse Landlord upon demand for the amount so paid by 
Landlord, including Landlords expenses and attorneys fees.


ARTICLE TEN
ASSIGNMENT AND SUBLETTING
 
10.01       	ASSIGNMENT AND SUBLETTING


  (a)       Without the prior written consent of Landlord, which may be 
withheld in Landlords sole discretion, Tenant may not sublease, assign, 
mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise transfer or permit the transfer 
of this Lease or the encumbering of Tenants interest therein in whole or 
in part, by operation of Law or otherwise or permit the use or occupancy of 
the Premises, or any part thereof, by anyone other than Tenant, provided, 
however, if Landlord chooses not to recapture the space proposed to be 
subleased or assigned as provided in Section 10.02, Landlord shall not 
unreasonably withhold its consent to a subletting or assignment under this 
Section 10.01. Tenant agrees that the provisions governing sublease and 
assignment set forth in this Article Ten shall be deemed to be
 
15

------------------------------------------------------------------------
reasonable. If Tenant desires to enter into any sublease of the Premises or 
assignment of this Lease, Tenant shall deliver written notice thereof to 
Landlord (Tenants Notice), together with the identity of the proposed 
subtenant or assignee and the proposed principal terms thereof and 
financial and other information sufficient for Landlord to make an informed 
judgment with respect to such proposed subtenant or assignee at least sixty 
(60) days prior to the commencement date of the term of the proposed 
sublease or assignment. If Tenant proposes to sublease less than all of the 
Rentable Area of the Premises, the space proposed to be sublet and the 
space retained by Tenant must each be a marketable unit as reasonably 
determined by Landlord and otherwise in compliance with all Laws. Landlord 
shall notify Tenant in writing of its approval or disapproval of the 
proposed sublease or assignment or its decision to exercise its rights 
under Section 10.02 within thirty (30) days after receipt of Tenants 
Notice (and all required information). In no event may Tenant sublease any 
portion of the Premises or assign the Lease to any other tenant of the 
Project. Tenant shall submit for Landlords approval (which approval shall 
not be unreasonably withheld) any advertising which Tenant or its agents 
intend to use with respect to the space proposed to be sublet.


  (b)       With respect to Landlords consent to an assignment or 
sublease, Landlord may take into consideration any factors which Landlord 
may deem relevant, and the reasons for which Landlords denial shall be 
deemed to be reasonable shall include, without limitation, the following:


  (i)       the business reputation or creditworthiness of any proposed 
subtenant or assignee is not acceptable to Landlord; or


  (ii)       in Landlords reasonable judgment the proposed assignee or 
subtenant would diminish the value or reputation of the Building or 
Landlord; or


  (iii)       any proposed assignees or subtenants use of the Premises 
would violate Section 7.01 of the Lease or would violate the provisions of 
any other leases of tenants in the Project;


  (iv)       the proposed assignee or subtenant is either a governmental 
agency, a school or similar operation, or a medical related practice; or


  (v)       the proposed subtenant or assignee is a bona fide prospective 
tenant of Landlord in the Project as demonstrated by a written proposal 
dated within ninety (90) days prior to the date of Tenants request; or


  (vi)       the proposed subtenant or assignee would materially increase 
the estimated pedestrian and vehicular traffic to and from the Premises and 
the Building.


In no event shall Landlord be obligated to consider a consent to any 
proposed assignment of the Lease which would assign less than the entire 
Premises. In the event Landlord wrongfully withholds its consent to any 
proposed sublease of the Premises or assignment of the Lease, Tenants sole 
and exclusive remedy therefor shall be to seek specific performance of 
Landlords obligations to consent to such sublease or assignment.


  (c)       Any sublease or assignment shall be expressly subject to the 
terms and conditions of this Lease. Any subtenant or assignee shall execute 
such documents as Landlord may reasonably require to evidence such 
subtenant or assignees assumption of the obligations and liabilities of 
Tenant under this Lease. Tenant shall deliver to Landlord a copy of all 
agreements executed by Tenant and the proposed subtenant and assignee with 
respect to the Premises. Landlords approval of a sublease, assignment, 
hypothecation, transfer or third party use or occupancy shall not 
constitute a waiver of Tenants obligation to obtain Landlords consent to 
further assignments or subleases, hypothecations, transfers or third party 
use or occupancy.


  (d)       For purposes of this Article Ten, an assignment shall be deemed 
to include a change in the majority control of Tenant, resulting from any 
transfer, sale or assignment of shares of stock of Tenant occurring by 
operation of Law or otherwise, and includes any merger, acquisition, 
consolidation or reorganization. Notwithstanding any provision of this 
Section to the contrary, an assignment for purposes of this Article does 
not include any transfer of control of the stock or membership interests of 
Tenant through: (i) any public offering of shares of stock in Tenant in 
accordance with applicable State and Federal law, rules, regulations and 
orders if thereafter the stock shall be listed and publicly traded through 
the New York Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ national market; or (ii) public 
sale of such stock effected through such exchange or the NASDAQ national 
market. If Tenant is a partnership, any change in the partners of Tenant 
shall be deemed to be an assignment; or (iii) bona-fide, new issuance of 
shares of stock or membership interests of Tenant in a private offering or 
private offerings for fair cash consideration immediately paid to Tenant 
which increases Tenants equity and net worth.


  (e)       Tenant may assign this Lease to a successor to Tenant by 
purchase, merger, consolidation or non-bankruptcy reorganization (an 
Ownership Change) or assign this Lease or sublet all or a portion of the 
Premises to an Affiliate without the consent of Landlord, provided that all 
of the following conditions are satisfied (a Permitted Transfer, and such 
permitted assignee or subtenant is a Permitted Transferee): (i) Tenant is 
not in Default; (ii) in the event of an Ownership Change, Tenants 
successor shall own substantially all of the assets of Tenant and have a 
net worth which is at least equal to Tenants net worth as of the day prior 
to the proposed Ownership Change, or in the event of a Transfer to an 
Affiliate, Tenant continues to have a net worth equal to or greater than 
Tenants net worth at the date of this Lease or the Affiliate has a net 
worth equal to Tenants net worth at the date of this Lease; (iii) Tenant 
shall give Landlord written notice at least 15 business days prior to the 
effective date of the Permitted Transfer; and (iv) Tenant and Tenants 
successor shall sign an assumption of all obligations of the Tenant under 
the Lease, and if requested by Landlord, a form of agreement setting forth 
representations as to the type of Ownership Change and as to the facts that 
satisfy each of conditions (i)  (iii) above. Tenants notice to Landlord 
shall include information and documentation evidencing the Permitted 
Transfer and showing that each of the above conditions has been satisfied.
 
16

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 
  (f)       With respect to any sublease, including any to a Permitted 
Transferee, Tenant hereby irrevocably assigns to Landlord, effective upon 
any such sublease, all rent and other payments due from subtenant under the 
sublease, provided however, that Tenant shall have a license to collect 
such rent and other payments until the occurrence of a default by Tenant 
under any of the provisions of the Lease, and notice to Tenant of such 
default shall not be a prerequisite to Landlords right to collect subrent. 
At any time at Landlords option, Landlord shall have the right to give 
notice to the subtenant of such assignment. Landlord shall credit Tenant 
with any rent received by Landlord under such assignment but the acceptance 
of any payment on account of rent from the subtenant as the result of any 
such default shall in no manner whatsoever serve to release Tenant from any 
liability under the terms, covenants, conditions, provisions or agreement 
under the Lease. No such payment of rent or any other payment by the 
subtenant directly to Landlord and/or acceptance of such payment(s) by 
Landlord, regardless of the circumstances or reasons therefor, shall in any 
manner whatsoever be deemed an attornment by the subtenant to Landlord in 
the absence of a specific written agreement signed by Landlord to such an 
effect. For purposes of this Section, any use or occupancy by a Permitted 
Transferee (unless it is an assignee) without a formal sublease shall for 
the purposes of this Section be deemed to be a sublease at the same rental 
rate as provided in the Lease.
 
10.02       	RECAPTURE


Landlord shall have the option to exclude from the Premises covered by this 
Lease (recapture), the space proposed to be sublet or subject to the 
assignment, so long as (i) the proposed transfer is not to a Permitted 
Transferee in accordance with the provisions of Section 10.01(e), and (ii) 
the proposed sublease is for the remainder of the Term of this Lease and 
Landlord recaptures the entire portion of the Premises subject to the 
proposed sublease. If Landlord elects to recapture, such recapture shall be 
effective as of the commencement date of such sublease or assignment, and 
Tenant shall surrender possession of the recapture space on the day 
immediately before such effective date, such date being the Termination 
Date for such space. Effective as of the date of recapture of any portion 
of the Premises pursuant to this section, the Monthly Base Rent, Rentable 
Area of the Premises and Tenants Share shall be adjusted accordingly.
 
10.03       	EXCESS RENT


Tenant shall pay Landlord on the first day of each month during the term of 
the sublease or assignment, fifty percent (50%) of the amount by which the 
sum of all rent and other consideration (direct or indirect) due from the 
subtenant or assignee for such month exceeds: (i) that portion of the 
Monthly Base Rent and Rent Adjustments due under this Lease for said month 
which is allocable to the space sublet or assigned; and (ii) the following 
costs and expenses for the subletting or assignment of such space: (1) 
brokerage commissions and attorneys fees and expenses, (2) the actual 
costs paid in making any improvements or substitutions in the Premises 
required by any sublease or assignment; and (3) free rent periods, costs 
of any inducements or concessions given to subtenant or assignee, moving 
costs, and other amounts in respect of such subtenants or assignees other 
leases or occupancy arrangements. All such costs and expenses shall be 
amortized over the term of the sublease or assignment pursuant to sound 
accounting principles.
 
10.04       	TENANT LIABILITY


In the event of any sublease or assignment, whether or not with Landlords 
consent, Tenant shall not be released or discharged from any liability, 
whether past, present or future, under this Lease, including any liability 
arising from the exercise of any renewal or expansion option, to the extent 
such exercise is expressly permitted by Landlord. Tenants liability shall 
remain primary, and in the event of default by any subtenant, assignee or 
successor of Tenant in performance or observance of any of the covenants or 
conditions of this Lease, Landlord may proceed directly against Tenant 
without the necessity of exhausting remedies against said subtenant, 
assignee or successor. After any assignment, Landlord may consent to 
subsequent assignments or subletting of this Lease, or amendments or 
modifications of this Lease with assignees of Tenant, without notifying 
Tenant, or any successor of Tenant, and without obtaining its or their 
consent thereto, and such action shall not relieve Tenant or any successor 
of Tenant of liability under this Lease. If Landlord grants consent to such 
sublease or assignment, Tenant shall pay all reasonable attorneys fees and 
expenses incurred by Landlord with respect to any assignment or sublease. 
In addition, if Tenant has any options to extend the term of this Lease or 
to add other space to the Premises, such options shall not be available to 
any subtenant or assignee, directly or indirectly without Landlords 
express written consent, which may be withheld in Landlords sole 
discretion.
 
10.05       	ASSUMPTION AND ATTORNMENT


If Tenant shall assign this Lease as permitted herein, the assignee shall 
expressly assume all of the obligations of Tenant hereunder in a written 
instrument satisfactory to Landlord and furnished to Landlord not later 
than fifteen (15) days prior to the effective date of the assignment. If 
Tenant shall sublease the Premises as permitted herein, Tenant shall, at 
Landlords option, within fifteen (15) days following any request by 
Landlord, obtain and furnish to Landlord the written agreement of such 
subtenant to the effect that the subtenant will attorn to Landlord and will 
pay all subrent directly to Landlord.


ARTICLE ELEVEN
DEFAULT AND REMEDIES
 
11.01       	EVENTS OF DEFAULT


The occurrence or existence of any one or more of the following shall 
constitute a Default by Tenant under this Lease:


  (i)       Tenant fails to pay any installment or other payment of Rent 
including Rent Adjustment Deposits or Rent Adjustments within five (5) 
business days after the date when due;

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 
  (ii)       Tenant fails to observe or perform any of the other covenants, 
conditions or provisions of this Lease or the Workletter and, unless the

is no cure or grace period or no additional period to cure beyond that set 
forth in such other provision of this Lease, fails to cure such default 
within thirty (30) days after written notice thereof to Tenant, provided 
that, if Tenant has exercised reasonable diligence to cure such failure and 
such failure cannot reasonably be cured within such thirty (30) day period, 
then such cure period shall be extended, but not in excess of an additional 
sixty (60) days plus such period during which such cure is prevented due to 
Force Majeure, so long as Tenant diligently and continuously prosecutes the 
cure to completion;


  (iii)       the interest of Tenant in this Lease is levied upon under 
execution or other legal process, and such levy is not dismissed or 
withdrawn within thirty (30) days;


  (iv)       a petition is filed by or against Tenant to declare Tenant 
bankrupt or seeking a plan of reorganization or arrangement under any 
Chapter of the Bankruptcy Act, or any amendment, replacement or 
substitution therefor, or to delay payment of, reduce or modify Tenants 
debts, which in the case of an involuntary action is not dismissed or 
withdrawn within thirty (30) days;

  (v)       Tenant is declared insolvent by Law or any assignment of 
Tenants property is made for the benefit of creditors;


  (vi)       a receiver is appointed for Tenant or Tenants property, which

  (vii)       upon the dissolution of Tenant.
 
11.02 	  LANDLORDS REMEDIES


    (a)       A Default shall constitute a breach of the Lease for which 
Landlord shall have the rights and remedies set forth in this Section 11.02 
and all other rights and remedies set forth in this Lease or now or 
hereafter allowed by Law, whether legal or equitable, and all rights and 
remedies of Landlord shall be cumulative and none shall exclude any other 
right or remedy.


    (b)       With respect to a Default, at any time Landlord may terminate 
Tenants right to possession by written notice to Tenant stating such 
election. Upon the termination of Tenants right to possession pursuant to 
this Section 11.02, Tenants right to possession shall terminate and this 
Lease shall terminate, and Tenant shall remain liable as hereinafter 
provided. Upon such termination, Landlord shall have the right, subject to 
applicable Law, to re-enter the Premises and dispossess Tenant and the 
legal representatives of Tenant and all other occupants of the Premises by 
unlawful detainer or other summary proceedings, or otherwise as permitted 
by Law, regain possession of the Premises and remove their property 
(including their personal property and those trade fixtures or Tenant 
Additions which Tenant is required or permitted to remove under Article 
Twelve), but Landlord shall not be obligated to effect such removal, and 
such property may, at Landlords option, be stored elsewhere, sold or 
otherwise dealt with as permitted by Law, at the risk of, expense of and 
for the account of Tenant, and the proceeds of any sale shall be applied 
pursuant to Law. Landlord shall in no event be responsible for the value, 
preservation or safekeeping of any such property. Tenant hereby waives all 
claims for damages that may be caused by Landlords removing or storing 
Tenants personal property pursuant to this Section or Section 12.01, and 
Tenant hereby indemnifies, and agrees to defend, protect and hold harmless, 
the Indemnitees from any and all loss, claims, demands, actions, expenses, 
liability and cost (including attorneys fees and expenses) arising out of 
or in any way related to such removal or storage. Upon such written 
termination of Tenants right to possession and this Lease, Landlord shall 
have the right to recover damages for Tenants Default as provided herein 
or by Law, including the following damages provided by California Civil 
Code Section 1951.2:


    (1)       the worth at the time of award of the unpaid Rent which had 
been earned at the time of termination;


    (2)       the worth at the time of award of the amount by which the 
unpaid Rent which would have been earned after termination until the time 
of award exceeds the amount of such Rent loss that Tenant proves could 
reasonably have been avoided;


    (3)       the worth at the time of award of the amount by which the 
unpaid Rent for the balance of the term of this Lease after the time of 
award exceeds the amount of such Rent loss that Tenant proves could be 
reasonably avoided; and


            (4)       any other amount necessary to compensate Landlord for 
all the detriment proximately caused by Tenants failure to perform its 
obligations under this Lease or which in the ordinary course of things 
would be likely to result therefrom. The word rent as used in this 
Section 11.02 shall have the same meaning as the defined term Rent in this 
Lease. The worth at the time of award of the amount referred to in 
clauses (1) and (2) above is computed by allowing interest at the Default 
Rate. The worth at the time of award of the amount referred to in clause 
(3) above is computed by discounting such amount at the discount rate of 
the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco at the time of award plus one 
percent (1%). For the purpose of determining unpaid Rent under clause (3) 
above, the monthly Rent reserved in this Lease shall be deemed to be the 
sum of the Monthly Base Rent, and monthly Storage Space Rent, if any,
 
18

------------------------------------------------------------------------
and the amounts last payable by Tenant as Rent Adjustments for the calendar 
year in which Landlord terminated this Lease as provided hereinabove.


  (c)       Even if Tenant is in Default and/or has abandoned the Premises, 
this Lease shall continue in effect for so long as Landlord does not 
terminate Tenants right to possession by written notice as provided in 
Section 11.02(b) above, and Landlord may enforce all its rights and 
remedies under this Lease, including the right to recover Rent as it 
becomes due under this Lease. In such event, Landlord shall have all of the 
rights and remedies of a landlord under California Civil Code Section 
1951.4 (lessor may continue Lease in effect after Tenants Default and 
abandonment and recover Rent as it becomes due, if Tenant has the right to 
sublet or assign, subject only to reasonable limitations), or any successor 
statute. During such time as Tenant is in Default, if Landlord has not 
terminated this Lease by written notice and if Tenant requests Landlords 
consent to an assignment of this Lease or a sublease of the Premises, 
subject to Landlords option to recapture pursuant to Section 10.02, 
Landlord shall not unreasonably withhold its consent to such assignment or 
sublease. Tenant acknowledges and agrees that the provisions of Article Ten 
shall be deemed to constitute reasonable limitations of Tenants right to 
assign or sublet. Tenant acknowledges and agrees that in the absence of 
written notice pursuant to Section 11.02(b) above terminating Tenants 
right to possession, no other act of Landlord shall constitute a 
termination of Tenants right to possession or an acceptance of Tenants 
surrender of the Premises, including acts of maintenance or preservation or 
efforts to relet the Premises or the appointment of a receiver upon 
initiative of Landlord to protect Landlords interest under this Lease or 
the withholding of consent to a subletting or assignment, or terminating a 
subletting or assignment, if in accordance with other provisions of this 
Lease.


  (d)       In the event that Landlord seeks an injunction with respect to 
a breach or threatened breach by Tenant of any of the covenants, conditions 
or provisions of this Lease, Tenant agrees to pay the premium for any bond 
required in connection with such injunction.


  (e)       Tenant hereby waives any and all rights to relief from 
forfeiture, redemption or reinstatement granted by Law (including 
California Civil Code of Procedure Sections 1174 and 1179) in the event of 
Tenant being evicted or dispossessed for any cause or in the event of 
Landlord obtaining possession of the Premises by reason of Tenants Default 
or otherwise;


  (f)       When this Lease requires giving or service of a notice of 
Default or of a failure of Tenant to observe or perform any covenant, 
condition or provision of this Lease which will constitute a Default unless 
Tenant so observes or performs within any applicable cure period, and so 
long as the notice given or served provides Tenant the longer of any 
applicable cure period required by this Lease or by statute, then the 
giving of any equivalent or similar statutory notice, including any 
equivalent or similar notices required by California Code of Civil 
Procedure Section 1161 or any similar or successor statute, shall replace 
and suffice as any notice required under this Lease. When a statute 
requires service of a notice in a particular manner, service of that notice 
(or a similar notice required by this Lease) in the manner required by 
Article Twenty-four shall replace and satisfy the statutory 
serviceofnotice procedures, except that any notice of unlawful detainer 
required by California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1161 or any similar 
or successor statute shall be served as required by Code of Civil Procedure 
Section 1162 or any similar or successor statute, and for purposes of Code 
of Civil Procedure Section 1162 or any similar or successor statute, 
Tenants place of residence and usual place of business shall mean the 
address specified by Tenant for notice pursuant to Section 1.01 of this 
Lease, as changed by Tenant pursuant to Article Twenty-four of this Lease.


  (g)       The voluntary or other surrender or termination of this Lease, 
or a mutual termination or cancellation thereof, shall not work a merger 
and shall terminate all or any existing assignments, subleases, 
subtenancies or occupancies permitted by Tenant, except if and as otherwise 
specified in writing by Landlord.


  (h)       No delay or omission in the exercise of any right or remedy of 
Landlord upon any default by Tenant, and no exercise by Landlord of its 
rights pursuant to Section 26.15 to perform any duty which Tenant fails 
timely to perform, shall impair any right or remedy or be construed as a 
waiver. No provision of this Lease shall be deemed waived by Landlord 
unless such waiver is in a writing signed by Landlord. The waiver by 
Landlord of any breach of any provision of this Lease shall not be deemed a 
waiver of any subsequent breach of the same or any other provision of this 
Lease.
 
11.03       	ATTORNEYS FEES


In the event any party brings any suit or other proceeding with respect to 
the subject matter or enforcement of this Lease, the prevailing party (as 
determined by the court, agency or other authority before which such suit 
or proceeding is commenced) shall, in addition to such other relief as may 
be awarded, be entitled to recover attorneys fees, expenses and costs of 
investigation as actually incurred, including court costs, expert witness 
fees, costs and expenses of investigation, and all attorneys fees, costs 
and expenses in any such suit or proceeding (including in any action or 
participation in or in connection with any case or proceeding under the 
Bankruptcy Code, 11 United States Code Sections 101 et seq., or any 
successor statutes, in establishing or enforcing the right to 
indemnification, in appellate proceedings, or in connection with the 
enforcement or collection of any judgment obtained in any such suit or 
proceeding).
 
11.04       	BANKRUPTCY


The following provisions shall apply in the event of the bankruptcy or 
insolvency of Tenant:


  (a)       In connection with any proceeding under Chapter 7 of the 
Bankruptcy Code where the trustee of Tenant elects to assume this Lease for 
the purposes of assigning it, such election or assignment, may only be made 
upon compliance with the provisions of (b) and (c) below, which conditions 
Landlord and Tenant acknowledge to be
 
19

------------------------------------------------------------------------
commercially reasonable. In the event the trustee elects to reject this 
Lease then Landlord shall immediately be entitled to possession of the 
Premises without further obligation to Tenant or the trustee.


  (b)       Any election to assume this Lease under Chapter 11 or 13 of the 
Bankruptcy Code by Tenant as debtor-in-possession or by Tenants trustee 
(the Electing Party) must provide for:

The Electing Party to cure or provide to Landlord adequate assurance that 
it will cure all monetary defaults under this Lease within fifteen (15) 
days from the date of assumption and it will cure all nonmonetary defaults 
under this Lease within thirty (30) days from the date of assumption. 
Landlord and Tenant acknowledge such condition to be commercially 
reasonable.


  (c)      If the Electing Party has assumed this Lease or elects to assign 
Tenants interest under this Lease to any other person, such interest may 
be assigned only if the intended assignee has provided adequate assurance 
of future performance (as herein defined), of all of the obligations 
imposed on Tenant under this Lease.

For the purposes hereof, adequate assurance of future performance means 
that Landlord has ascertained that each of the following conditions has 
been satisfied:

(i)       The assignee has submitted a current financial statement, 
certified by its chief financial officer, which shows a net worth and 
working capital in amounts sufficient to assure the future performance by 
the assignee of Tenants obligations under this Lease; and

(ii)       Landlord has obtained consents or waivers from any third parties 
which may be required under a lease, mortgage, financing arrangement, or 
other agreement by which Landlord is bound, to enable Landlord to permit 
such assignment.


(d)       Landlords acceptance of rent or any other payment from any 
trustee, receiver, assignee, person, or other entity will not be deemed to 
have waived, or waive, the requirement of Landlords consent, Landlords 
right to terminate this Lease for any transfer of Tenants interest under 
this Lease without such consent, or Landlords claim for any amount of Rent 
due from Tenant.
 
11.05       	LANDLORDS DEFAULT


Landlord shall be in default hereunder in the event Landlord has not begun 
and pursued with reasonable diligence the cure of any failure of Landlord 
to meet its obligations hereunder within thirty (30) days after the receipt 
by Landlord of written notice from Tenant of the alleged failure to 
perform. In no event shall Tenant have the right to terminate or rescind 
this Lease as a result of Landlords default as to any covenant or 
agreement contained in this Lease. Tenant hereby waives such remedies of 
termination and rescission and hereby agrees that Tenants remedies for 
default hereunder and for breach of any promise or inducement shall be 
limited to a suit for damages and/or injunction.


ARTICLE TWELVE
SURRENDER OF PREMISES
 
12.01       	IN GENERAL


Upon the Termination Date, Tenant shall surrender and vacate the Premises 
immediately and deliver possession thereof to Landlord in a clean, good and 
tenantable condition, ordinary wear and tear, and damage caused by Landlord 
excepted. Tenant shall deliver to Landlord all keys to the Premises. Tenant 
shall remove from the Premises all movable personal property of Tenant, 
Tenants trade fixtures, and subject to Section 6.03, cabling. Tenant shall 
be entitled to remove such Tenant Additions which at the time of their 
installation Landlord and Tenant agreed may be removed by Tenant. Tenant 
shall also remove such other Tenant Additions as required by Landlord, 
including any Tenant Additions containing Hazardous Material. Tenant 
immediately shall repair all damage resulting from removal of any of 
Tenants property, furnishings or Tenant Additions, shall close all floor, 
ceiling and roof openings and shall restore the Premises to a tenantable 
condition as reasonably determined by Landlord. If any of the Tenant 
Additions which were installed by Tenant involved the lowering of ceilings, 
raising of floors or the installation of specialized wall or floor 
coverings or lights, then Tenant shall also be obligated to return such 
surfaces to their condition prior to the commencement of this Lease. Tenant 
shall also be required to close any staircases or other openings between 
floors. In the event possession of the Premises is not delivered to 
Landlord when required hereunder, or if Tenant shall fail to remove those 
items described above, Landlord may (but shall not be obligated to), at 
Tenants expense, remove any of such property and store, sell or otherwise 
deal with such property as provided in Section 11.02(b), including the 
waiver and indemnity obligations provided in that Section, and undertake, 
at Tenants expense, such restoration work as Landlord deems necessary or 
advisable.
 
12.02       	LANDLORDS RIGHTS


All property which may be removed from the Premises by Landlord shall be 
conclusively presumed to have been abandoned by Tenant and Landlord may 
deal with such property as provided in Section 11.02(b), including the 
waiver and indemnity obligations provided in that Section. Tenant shall 
also reimburse Landlord for all costs and expenses incurred by Landlord in 
removing any of Tenant Additions and in restoring the Premises to the 
condition required by this Lease at the Termination Date.
 
20

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 
ARTICLE THIRTEEN
HOLDING OVER


Tenant shall pay Landlord the greater of (i) double the monthly Rent 
payable for the month immediately preceding the holding over (including 
increases for Rent Adjustments which Landlord may reasonably estimate) or, 
(ii) double the fair market rental value of the Premises as reasonably 
determined by Landlord for each month or portion thereof that Tenant 
retains possession of the Premises, or any portion thereof, after the 
Termination Date (without reduction for any partial month that Tenant 
retains possession). Tenant shall also pay all damages sustained by 
Landlord by reason of such retention of possession. The provisions of this 
Article shall not constitute a waiver by Landlord of any re-entry rights of 
Landlord and Tenants continued occupancy of the Premises shall be as a 
tenancy in sufferance. If Tenant retains possession of the Premises, or any 
part thereof for thirty (30) days after the Termination Date then at the 
sole option of Landlord expressed by written notice to Tenant, but not 
otherwise, such holding over shall constitute an extension of the Term of 
this Lease for a period of one (1) year on the same terms and conditions 
(including those with respect to the payment of Rent) as provided in this 
Lease, except that the Monthly Base Rent for such period shall be equal to 
the greater of (i) 150% of the Monthly Base Rent payable during the month 
preceding the Termination Date, or (ii) 150% of the monthly base rent then 
being quoted by Landlord for similar space in the Building.


ARTICLE FOURTEEN
DAMAGE BY FIRE OR OTHER CASUALTY
 
14.01       	SUBSTANTIAL UNTENANTABILITY


  (a)       If any fire or other casualty (whether insured or uninsured) 
renders all or a substantial portion of the Premises or the Building 
untenantable, Landlord shall, with reasonable promptness after the 
occurrence of such damage, estimate the length of time that will be 
required to substantially complete the repair and restoration and shall by 
notice advise Tenant of such estimate (Landlords Notice). If Landlord 
estimates that the amount of time required to substantially complete such 
repair and restoration will exceed one hundred eighty (180) days from the 
date such damage occurred, then Landlord, or Tenant if all or a substantial 
portion of the Premises is rendered untenantable, shall have the right to 
terminate this Lease as of the date of such damage upon giving written 
notice to the other at any time within twenty (20) days after delivery of 
Landlords Notice, provided that if Landlord so chooses, Landlords Notice 
may also constitute such notice of termination.


  (b)       In the event that the Building is damaged or destroyed to the 
extent of more than twenty-five percent (25%) of its replacement cost or to 
any extent if no insurance proceeds or insufficient insurance proceeds are 
receivable by Landlord, or if the buildings at the Project shall be damaged 
to the extent of fifty percent (50%) or more of the replacement value or to 
any extent if no insurance proceeds or insufficient insurance proceeds are 
receivable by Landlord, and regardless of whether or not the Premises be 
damaged, Landlord may elect by written notice to Tenant given within thirty 
(30) days after the occurrence of the casualty to terminate this Lease in 
lieu of so restoring the Premises, in which event this Lease shall 
terminate as of the date specified in Landlords notice, which date shall 
be no later than sixty (60) days following the date of Landlords notice.


  (c)       Unless this Lease is terminated as provided in the preceding 
Subsections 14.01 (a) and (b), Landlord shall proceed with reasonable 
promptness to repair and restore the Premises to its condition as existed 
prior to such casualty, subject to reasonable delays for insurance 
adjustments and Force Majeure delays, and also subject to zoning Laws and 
building codes then in effect. Landlord shall have no liability to Tenant, 
and Tenant shall not be entitled to terminate this Lease if such repairs 
and restoration are not in fact completed within the time period estimated 
by Landlord so long as Landlord shall proceed with reasonable diligence to 
complete such repairs and restoration.


  (d)       Tenant acknowledges that Landlord shall be entitled to the full 
proceeds of any insurance coverage, whether carried by Landlord or Tenant, 
for damages to the Premises, except for those proceeds of Tenants 
insurance of its own personal property and equipment which would be 
removable by Tenant at the Termination Date. All such insurance proceeds 
shall be payable to Landlord whether or not the Premises are to be repaired 
and restored, provided, however, if this Lease is not terminated and the 
parties proceed to repair and restore Tenant Additions at Tenants cost, to 
the extent Landlord received proceeds of Tenants insurance covering Tenant 
Additions, such proceeds shall be applied to reimburse Tenant for its cost 
of repairing and restoring Tenant Additions.


  (e)       Notwithstanding anything in this Article Fourteen to the 
contrary: (i) Landlord shall have no duty pursuant to this Section to 
repair or restore any portion of any Tenant Additions or to expend for any 
repair or restoration of the Premises or Building amounts in excess of 
insurance proceeds paid to Landlord and available for repair or 
restoration; (ii) Tenant shall not have the right to terminate this Lease 
pursuant to this Section if any damage or destruction was caused by the 
willful and wrongful act of Tenant, its agent or employees; and (iii) in 
the event that the Premises is located in more than one building of the 
Project and any damage or destruction covered by this Article affects only 
one of the buildings in which the Premises is located, then the 
determination of the extent of damage or destruction shall be made only 
with respect to the building so affected, and Landlord or Tenant shall be 
entitled to terminate this Lease only with respect to the part of the 
Premises in the building so affected, and the Lease shall continue in full 
force and effect to the extent of the remainder, if any, of the Premises. 
Whether or not the Lease is terminated pursuant to this Article Fourteen, 
in no event shall Tenant be entitled to any compensation or damages for 
loss of the use of the whole or any part of the Premises or for any 
inconvenience or annoyance occasioned by any such damage, destruction, 
rebuilding or restoration of the Premises or the Building or access 
thereto.
 
21

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 
  (f)       Any repair or restoration of the Premises performed by Tenant 
shall be in accordance with the provisions of Article Nine hereof.
 
14.02       	INSUBSTANTIAL UNTENANTABILITY


Unless this Lease is terminated as provided in the preceding Subsections 
14.01 (a) and (b), then Landlord shall proceed to repair and restore the 
Building or the Premises other than Tenant Additions, with reasonable 
promptness, unless such damage is to the Premises and occurs during the 
last six (6) months of the Term, in which event either Tenant or Landlord 
shall have the right to terminate this Lease as of the date of such 
casualty by giving written notice thereof to the other within twenty (20) 
days after the date of such casualty. Notwithstanding the foregoing, 
Landlords obligation to repair shall be limited in accordance with the 
provisions of Section 14.01 above.
 
14.03       	RENT ABATEMENT


If all or any part of the Premises are rendered untenantable by fire or 
other casualty and this Lease is not terminated, Monthly Base Rent and Rent 
Adjustments shall abate for that part of the Premises which is untenantable 
on a per diem basis from the date of the casualty until Landlord has 
Substantially Completed the repair and restoration work in the Premises 
which it is required to perform, provided, that as a result of such 
casualty, Tenant does not occupy the portion of the Premises which is 
untenantable during such period. The foregoing rent abatement shall not 
apply in the event the Premises are rendered untenantable by reason of a 
fire or other casualty caused in whole or in part by the negligence or 
willful act of Tenant or its agents, employees, contractors or invitees if 
such abatement would adversely affect Landlords or Tenants ability to 
collect under any of its insurance policies providing coverage for rental 
or business interruptions.
 
14.04       	WAIVER OF STATUTORY REMEDIES


The provisions of this Lease, including this Article Fourteen, constitute 
an express agreement between Landlord and Tenant with respect to any and 
all damage to, or destruction of, the Premises or the Property or any part 
of either, and any Law, including Sections 1932(2), 1933(4), 1941 and 1942 
of the California Civil Code, with respect to any rights or obligations 
concerning damage or destruction shall have no application to this Lease or 
to any damage to or destruction of all or any part of the Premises or the 
Property or any part of either, and are hereby waived.


ARTICLE FIFTEEN
EMINENT DOMAIN


15.01         TAKING OF WHOLE OR SUBSTANTIAL PART


In the event the whole or any substantial part of the Building or of the 
Premises is taken or condemned by any competent authority for any public 
use or purpose (including a deed given in lieu of condemnation) and is 
thereby rendered untenantable, this Lease shall terminate as of the date 
title vests in such authority or any earlier date on which possession is 
required to be surrendered to such authority, and Monthly Base Rent and 
Rent Adjustments shall be apportioned as of the Termination Date. 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein set forth, in the event 
that the Premises is located in more than one building of the Project and 
any taking covered by this Article affects only one of the buildings in 
which the Premises is located, then the determination of the extent of the 
taking shall be made only with respect to the building so affected, and 
Landlord or Tenant shall be entitled to terminate this Lease only with 
respect to the part of the Premises in the building so affected, and the 
Lease shall continue in full force and effect to the extent of the 
remainder, if any, of the Premises. Further, if at least twenty-five 
percent (25%) of the rentable area of the Project is taken or condemned by 
any competent authority for any public use or purpose (including a deed 
given in lieu of condemnation), and regardless of whether or not the 
Premises be so taken or condemned, Landlord may elect by written notice to 
Tenant to terminate this Lease as of the date title vests in such authority 
or any earlier date on which possession is required to be surrendered to 
such authority, and Monthly Base Rent and Rent Adjustments shall be 
apportioned as of the Termination Date. Landlord may, without any 
obligation to Tenant, agree to sell or convey to the taking authority the 
Premises, the Building, Tenants Phase, the Project or any portion thereof 
sought by the taking authority, free from this Lease and the right of 
Tenant hereunder, without first requiring that any action or proceeding be 
instituted or, if instituted, pursued to a judgment. Notwithstanding 
anything to the contrary herein set forth, in the event the taking of the 
Building or Premises is temporary (for less than the remaining term of the 
Lease), Landlord may elect either (i) to terminate this Lease or (ii) 
permit Tenant to receive the entire award attributable to the Premises in 
which case Tenant shall continue to pay Rent and this Lease shall not 
terminate.
 
15.02       	TAKING OF PART


In the event a part of the Building or the Premises is taken or condemned 
by any competent authority (or a deed is delivered in lieu of condemnation) 
and this Lease is not terminated, the Lease shall be amended to reduce or 
increase, as the case may be, the Monthly Base Rent and Tenants Share to 
reflect the Rentable Area of the Premises or Building, as the case may be, 
remaining after any such taking or condemnation. Landlord, upon receipt and 
to the extent of the award in condemnation (or proceeds of sale) shall make 
necessary repairs and restorations to the Premises (exclusive of Tenant 
Additions) and to the Building to the extent necessary to constitute the 
portion of the Building not so taken or condemned as a complete 
architectural and economically efficient unit. Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, if as a result of any taking, or a governmental order that the 
grade of any street or alley adjacent to the Building is to be changed and 
such taking or change of grade makes it necessary or desirable to 
substantially remodel or restore the Building or prevents the economical 
operation of the Building, Landlord shall have the right to terminate this 
Lease upon ninety (90) days prior written notice to Tenant.
 
22

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 
15.03       	COMPENSATION


Landlord shall be entitled to receive the entire award (or sale proceeds) 
from any such taking, condemnation or sale without any payment to Tenant, 
and Tenant hereby assigns to Landlord Tenants interest, if any, in such 
award; provided, however, Tenant shall have the right separately to pursue 
against the condemning authority a separate award in respect of the loss, 
if any, to Tenant Additions paid for by Tenant without any credit or 
allowance from Landlord, for fixtures or personal property of Tenant, or 
for relocation or business interruption expenses, so long as there is no 
diminution of Landlords award as a result.


ARTICLE SIXTEEN
INSURANCE
 
16.01       	TENANTS INSURANCE


Tenant, at Tenants expense, agrees to maintain in force, with a company or 
companies acceptable to Landlord, during the Term: (a) Commercial General 
Liability Insurance on a primary basis and without any right of 
contribution from any insurance carried by Landlord covering the Premises 
on an occurrence basis against all claims for personal injury, bodily 
injury, death and property damage, including contractual liability covering 
the indemnification provisions in this Lease. Such insurance shall be for 
such limits that are reasonably required by Landlord from time to time but 
not less than a combined single limit of Three Million and No/100 Dollars 
($3,000,000.00); (b) Workers Compensation and Employers Liability 
Insurance to the extent required by and in accordance with the Laws of the 
State of California; (c) All Risks property insurance in an amount 
adequate to cover the full replacement cost of all Tenant Additions to the 
Premises, equipment, installations, fixtures and contents of the Premises 
in the event of loss; (d) In the event a motor vehicle is to be used by 
Tenant in connection with its business operation from the Premises, 
Comprehensive Automobile Liability Insurance coverage with limits of not 
less than One Million and No/100 Dollars ($1,000,000.00) combined single 
limit coverage against bodily injury liability and property damage 
liability arising out of the use by or on behalf of Tenant, its agents and 
employees in connection with this Lease, of any owned, non-owned or hired 
motor vehicles; and (e) such other insurance or coverages as Landlord 
reasonably requires.
 
16.02       	FORM OF POLICIES


Each policy referred to in 16.01 shall satisfy the following requirements. 
Each policy shall (i) name Landlord and the Indemnitees as additional 
insureds (except Workers Compensation, Hired/Non-owned Automobile and 
Employers Liability Insurance), (ii) be issued by one or more responsible 
insurance companies licensed to do business in the State of California 
reasonably satisfactory to Landlord, (iii) where applicable, provide for 
deductible amounts satisfactory to Landlord and not permit co-insurance, 
(iv) shall provide that such insurance may not be canceled or amended 
without thirty (30) days prior written notice to the Landlord, and (v) 
each policy of All-Risks property insurance shall provide that the policy 
shall not be invalidated should the insured waive in writing prior to a 
loss, any or all rights of recovery against any other party for losses 
covered by such policies. Tenant shall deliver to Landlord, certificates of 
insurance and at Landlords request, copies of all policies and renewals 
thereof to be maintained by Tenant hereunder, not less than ten (10) days 
prior to the Commencement Date and not less than ten (10) days prior to the 
expiration date of each policy.
 
16.03       	LANDLORDS INSURANCE


Landlord agrees to purchase and keep in full force and effect during the 
Term hereof, including any extensions or renewals thereof, insurance under 
policies issued by insurers of recognized responsibility, qualified to do 
business in the State of California on the Building in amounts not less 
than the greater of eighty (80%) percent of the then full replacement cost 
(without depreciation) of the Building (above foundations and excluding 
Tenant Additions to the Premises) or an amount sufficient to prevent 
Landlord from becoming a co-insurer under the terms of the applicable 
policies, against fire and such other risks as may be included in standard 
forms of all risk coverage insurance reasonably available from time to 
time. Landlord agrees to maintain in force during the Term, Commercial 
General Liability Insurance covering the Building on an occurrence basis 
against all claims for personal injury, bodily injury, death and property 
damage. Such insurance shall be for a combined single limit of Three 
Million and No/100 Dollars ($3,000,000.00). Neither Landlords obligation 
to carry such insurance nor the carrying of such insurance shall be deemed 
to be an indemnity by Landlord with respect to any claim, liability, loss, 
cost or expense due, in whole or in part, to Tenants negligent acts or 
omissions or willful misconduct. Without obligation to do so, Landlord may, 
in its sole discretion from time to time, carry insurance in amounts 
greater and/or for coverage additional to the coverage and amounts set 
forth above.
 
16.04       	WAIVER OF SUBROGATION


              (a)       Landlord agrees that, if obtainable at no, or 
minimal, additional cost, and so long as the same is permitted under the 
laws of the State of California, it will include in its All Risks 
policies appropriate clauses pursuant to which the insurance companies (i) 
waive all right of subrogation against Tenant with respect to losses 
payable under such policies and/or (ii) agree that such policies shall not 
be invalidated should the insured waive in writing prior to a loss any or 
all right of recovery against any party for losses covered by such 
policies.


  (b)       Tenant agrees to include, if obtainable at no, or minimal, 
additional cost, and so long as the same is permitted under the laws of the 
State of California, in its All Risks insurance policy or policies on 
Tenant Additions to the Premises, whether or not removable, and on Tenants 
furniture, furnishings, fixtures and other property removable by Tenant 
under the provisions of this Lease appropriate clauses pursuant to which 
the insurance company or companies (i) waive the right of subrogation 
against Landlord and/or any tenant of space in the Building with respect to 
losses payable under such policy or policies and/or (ii) agree that such 
policy or policies shall not be invalidated should the insured waive in 
writing prior to a loss any or all right of recovery against any party for 
losses covered by such policy or policies. If Tenant is unable to obtain in 
such policy or policies either of the clauses described in the preceding 
sentence, Tenant shall, if legally possible and without necessitating a 
change in insurance carriers, have Landlord named in such policy or 
policies as an additional insured. If Landlord shall be named as an 
additional insured in accordance with the foregoing, Landlord agrees to 
endorse promptly to the order of Tenant, without recourse, any check, 
draft, or order for the payment of money representing the proceeds of any 
such policy or representing any other payment growing out of or connected 
with said policies, and Landlord does hereby irrevocably waive any and all 
rights in and to such proceeds and payments.
 
23

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 
  (c)       Provided that Landlords right of full recovery under its 
policy or policies aforesaid is not adversely affected or prejudiced 
thereby, Landlord hereby waives any and all right of recovery which it 
might otherwise have against Tenant, its servants, agents and employees, 
for loss or damage occurring to the Real Property and the fixtures, 
appurtenances and equipment therein, except Tenant Additions, to the extent 
the same is covered by Landlords insurance, notwithstanding that such loss 
or damage may result from the negligence or fault of Tenant, its servants, 
agents or employees. Provided that Tenants right of full recovery under 
its aforesaid policy or policies is not adversely affected or prejudiced 
thereby, Tenant hereby waives any and all right of recovery which it might 
otherwise have against Landlord, its servants, and employees and against 
every other tenant in the Real Property who shall have executed a similar 
waiver as set forth in this Section 16.04 (c) for loss or damage to Tenant 
Additions, whether or not removable, and to Tenants furniture, 
furnishings, fixtures and other property removable by Tenant under the 
provisions hereof to the extent the same is covered or coverable by 
Tenants insurance required under this Lease, notwithstanding that such 
loss or damage may result from the negligence or fault of Landlord, its 
servants, agents or employees, or such other tenant and the servants, 
agents or employees thereof.


  (d)       Landlord and Tenant hereby agree to advise the other promptly 
if the clauses to be included in their respective insurance policies 
pursuant to subparagraphs (a) and (b) above cannot be obtained on the terms 
hereinbefore provided and thereafter to furnish the other with a 
certificate of insurance or copy of such policies showing the naming of the 
other as an additional insured, as aforesaid. Landlord and Tenant hereby 
also agree to notify the other promptly of any cancellation or change of 
the terms of any such policy which would affect such clauses or naming. All 
such policies which name both Landlord and Tenant as additional insureds 
shall, to the extent obtainable, contain agreements by the insurers to the 
effect that no act or omission of any additional insured will invalidate 
the policy as to the other additional insureds.
 
16.05       	NOTICE OF CASUALTY


Tenant shall give Landlord notice in case of a fire or accident in the 
Premises promptly after Tenant is aware of such event.


ARTICLE SEVENTEEN
WAIVER OF CLAIMS AND INDEMNITY
 
17.01       	WAIVER OF CLAIMS


To the extent permitted by Law, Tenant releases the Indemnitees from, and 
waives all claims for, damage to person or property sustained by the Tenant 
or any occupant of the Premises or the Property resulting directly or 
indirectly from any existing or future condition, defect, matter or thing 
in and about the Premises or the Property, or any part of either, or any 
equipment or appurtenance therein, or resulting from any accident in or 
about the Premises or the Property, or resulting directly or indirectly 
from any act or neglect of any tenant or occupant of the Property or of any 
other person, including Landlords agents and servants, except to the 
extent caused by the willful and wrongful act of any of the Indemnitees. If 
any such damage, whether to the Premises or the Property or any part of 
either, or whether to Landlord or to other tenants in the Property, results 
from any act or neglect of Tenant, its employees, servants, agents, 
contractors, invitees or customers, Tenant shall be liable therefor and 
Landlord may, at Landlords option, repair such damage and Tenant shall, 
upon demand by Landlord, as payment of additional Rent hereunder, reimburse 
Landlord within ten (10) days of demand for the total cost of such repairs, 
in excess of amounts, if any, paid to Landlord under insurance covering 
such damages. Tenant shall not be liable for any such damage caused by its 
acts or neglect if Landlord or a tenant has recovered the full amount of 
the damage from proceeds of insurance policies and the insurance company 
has waived its right of subrogation against Tenant. Notwithstanding any 
provision of the first sentence of this Section to the contrary, Tenants 
release of Landlord with respect to any existing condition shall not 
release Landlord from any liability which Landlord has to the extent that 
any Hazardous Material is in existence on the Premises or the Property 
prior to delivery of possession of the Premises to Tenant, except to the 
extent that the presence of such Hazardous Material is caused by acts or 
omissions of Tenant or any Tenant Parties (as defined in Article Seven) in 
connection with any early entry to the Premises prior to delivery of 
possession to Tenant.
 
17.02       	INDEMNITY BY TENANT


To the extent permitted by Law, Tenant hereby indemnifies, and agrees to 
protect, defend and hold the Indemnitees harmless, against any and all 
actions, claims, demands, liability, costs and expenses, including 
attorneys fees and expenses for the defense thereof, arising from Tenants 
occupancy of the Premises, from the undertaking of any Tenant Additions or 
repairs to the Premises, from the conduct of Tenants business on the 
Premises, or from any breach or default on the part of Tenant in the 
performance of any covenant or agreement on the part of Tenant to be 
performed pursuant to the terms of this Lease, or from any willful act or 
negligence of Tenant, its agents, contractors, servants, employees, 
customers or invitees, in or about the Premises or the Property or any part 
of either. In case of any action or proceeding brought against the 
Indemnitees by reason of any such claim, upon notice from Landlord, Tenant 
covenants to defend such action or proceeding by counsel chosen by 
Landlord, in Landlords sole discretion. Landlord reserves the right to 
settle, compromise or dispose of any and all actions,
 
24

------------------------------------------------------------------------
claims and demands related to the foregoing indemnity. The foregoing 
indemnity shall not operate to relieve an Indemnitee of liability to the 
extent such liability is caused by the gross negligence or the willful and 
wrongful act of such Indemnitee. Further, the foregoing indemnity is 
subject to and shall not diminish any waivers in effect in accordance with 
Section 16.04 by Landlord or its insurers to the extent of amounts, if any, 
paid to Landlord under its All-Risks property insurance.
 
17.03       	WAIVER OF CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES


To the extent permitted by law, Tenant hereby waives and releases the 
Indemnitees from any consequential damages, compensation or claims for 
inconvenience or loss of business, rents or profits as a result of any 
injury or damage, whether or not caused by the willful and wrongful act of 
any of the Indemnitees.

lease as against any other tenant, and the Landlord shall not be liable to 
the Tenant for violation of the same by any other tenant, its servants,

Landlord shall have the following rights exercisable without notice to

Premises for the purpose permitted hereunder; (6) to change the arrangement 
and/or location of entrances or passageways, doors and doorways, corridors, 
elevators, stairs, washrooms or public portions of the Building, and to 
close entrances, doors, corridors, elevators or other facilities, provided

ARTICLE TWENTY-TWO-
REAL ESTATE BROKERS


Tenant represents that in connection with this Lease it is represented by 
Tenants Broker identified in Section 1.01 and, except for Tenants Broker 
and Landlords Broker identified in Section 1.01, Tenant has not dealt with 
any real estate broker, sales person, or finder in connection with this 
Lease, and no such person initiated or participated in the negotiation of 
this Lease. Tenant hereby indemnifies and agrees to protect, defend and 
hold Landlord and Landlords Broker harmless from and against all claims, 
losses, damages, liability, costs and expenses (including, without 
limitation, attorneys fees and expenses) by virtue of any broker, agent or 
other person claiming a commission or other form of compensation by virtue

respect to the subject matter of this Lease, except for Landlords Broker 
and except for a commission payable to Tenants Broker to the extent 
provided for in a separate written agreement between Tenants Broker and 
Landlords Broker. Landlord hereby indemnifies and agrees to protect, 
defend and hold Tenant harmless from and against all claims, losses, 
damages, liability, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, 
attorneys fees and expenses) by virtue of any broker, agent or other 
person claiming a commission or other form of compensation by virtue of 
alleged representation of, or dealings or discussions with, Landlord with 
respect to the subject matter of this Lease, except for Tenants Broker.

Such commission shall include an amount to be shared by Landlords Broker

Lease.


ARTICLE TWENTY-THREE-
MORTGAGEE PROTECTION
 
23.01       	SUBORDINATION AND ATTORNMENT


This Lease is and shall be expressly subject and subordinate at all times 
to (i) any ground or underlying lease of the Real Property, now or 
hereafter existing, and all amendments, extensions, renewals and 
modifications to any such lease, and (ii) the lien of any mortgage or trust 
deed now or hereafter encumbering fee title to the Real Property and/or the 
leasehold estate under any such lease, and all amendments, extensions, 
renewals, replacements and modifications of such mortgage or trust deed 
and/or the obligation secured thereby, unless such ground lease or ground 
lessor, or mortgage, trust deed or Mortgagee, expressly provides or elects 
that the Lease shall be superior to such lease or mortgage or trust deed. 
If any such mortgage or trust deed is foreclosed (including any sale of the 
Real Property pursuant to a power of sale), or if any such lease is 
terminated, upon request of the Mortgagee or ground lessor, as the case may 
be, Tenant shall attorn to the purchaser at the foreclosure sale or to the 
ground lessor under such lease, as the case may be, provided, however, that 
such purchaser or ground lessor shall not be (i) bound by any payment of 
Rent for more than one month in advance except payments in the nature of 
security for the performance by Tenant of its obligations under this Lease; 
(ii) subject to any offset, defense or damages arising out of a default of 
any obligations of any preceding Landlord; or (iii) bound by any amendment 
or modification of this Lease made without the written consent of the 
Mortgagee or ground lessor; or (iv) liable for any security deposits not 
actually received in cash by such purchaser or ground lessor. This 
subordination shall be self-operative and no further certificate or 
instrument of subordination need be required by any such Mortgagee or 
ground lessor. In confirmation of such subordination, however, Tenant shall 
execute promptly any reasonable certificate or instrument that Landlord, 
Mortgagee or ground lessor may request. Tenant hereby constitutes Landlord 
as Tenants attorney-in-fact to execute such certificate or instrument for 
and on behalf of Tenant upon Tenants failure to do so within fifteen (15) 
days of a request to do so. Upon request by such successor in interest, 
Tenant shall execute and deliver reasonable instruments confirming the 
attornment provided for herein.
 
23.02 	MORTGAGEE PROTECTION


Tenant agrees to give any Mortgagee or ground lessor, by registered or 
certified mail, a copy of any notice of default served upon the Landlord by 
Tenant, provided that prior to such notice Tenant has received notice (by 
way of service on Tenant of a copy of an assignment of rents and leases, or 
otherwise) of the address of such Mortgagee or ground lessor. Tenant 
further agrees that if Landlord shall have failed to cure such default 
within the time provided for in this Lease, then the Mortgagee or ground 
lessor shall have an additional thirty (30) days after receipt of notice 
thereof within which to cure such default or if such default cannot be 
cured within that time, then such additional notice time as may be 
necessary, if, within such thirty (30) days, any Mortgagee or ground lessor 
has commenced and is diligently pursuing the remedies necessary to cure 
such default (including commencement of foreclosure proceedings or other 
proceedings to acquire possession of the Real Property, if necessary to 
effect such cure). Such period of time shall be extended by any period 
within which such Mortgagee or ground lessor is
 
26

------------------------------------------------------------------------
prevented from commencing or pursuing such foreclosure proceedings or other 
proceedings to acquire possession of the Real Property by reason of 
Landlords bankruptcy. Until the time allowed as aforesaid for Mortgagee or 
ground lessor to cure such defaults has expired without cure, Tenant shall 
have no right to, and shall not, terminate this Lease on account of 
default. This Lease may not be modified or amended so as to reduce the Rent 
or shorten the Term, or so as to adversely affect in any other respect to 
any material extent the rights of the Landlord, nor shall this Lease be 
canceled or surrendered, without the prior written consent, in each 
instance, of the ground lessor or the Mortgagee.


ARTICLE TWENTY-FOUR-
NOTICES


  (a)       All notices, demands or requests provided for or permitted to

delivered, sent by Federal Express or other reputable overnight courier 
service, or mailed by first class, registered or certified United States 
mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid.


  (b)       All notices, demands or requests to be sent pursuant to this 
Lease shall be deemed to have been properly given or served by delivering 
or sending the same in accordance with this Section, addressed to the 
parties hereto at their respective addresses listed in Sections 1.01(2) and 
(3).


  (c)       Notices, demands or requests sent by mail or overnight courier 
service as described above shall be effective upon deposit in the mail or 
with such courier service. However, the time period in which a response to 
any such notice, demand or request must be given shall commence to run from 
(i) in the case of delivery by mail, the date of receipt on the return 
receipt of the notice, demand or request by the addressee thereof, or (ii) 
in the case of delivery by Federal Express or other overnight courier 
service, the date of acceptance of delivery by an employee, officer, 
director or partner of Landlord or Tenant. Rejection or other refusal to 
accept or the inability to deliver because of changed address of which no 
notice was given, as indicated by advice from Federal Express or other 
overnight courier service or by mail return receipt, shall be deemed to be 
receipt of notice, demand or request sent. Notices may also be served by 
personal service upon any officer, director or partner of Landlord or 
Tenant, and shall be effective upon such service.


  (d)       By giving to the other party at least thirty (30) days written 
notice thereof, either party shall have the right from time to time during 
the term of this Lease to change its respective addresses for notices, 
statements, demands and requests, provided such new address shall be within 
the United States of America.


ARTICLE TWENTY-FIVE
EXERCISE FACILITY


Tenant agrees to inform all employees of Tenant of the following: (i) the 
exercise facility is available for the use of the employees of tenants of 
the Project only and for no other person; (ii) use of the facility is at 
the risk of Tenant or Tenants employees, and all users must sign a 
release; (iii) the facility is unsupervised; and (iv) users of the facility 
must report any needed equipment maintenance or any unsafe conditions to 
the Landlord immediately. Landlord may discontinue providing such facility 
at Landlords sole option at any time without incurring any liability. As a 
condition to the use of the exercise facility, Tenant and each of Tenants 
employees that uses the exercise facility shall first sign a written 
release in form and substance acceptable to Landlord. Landlord may change 
the rules and/or hours of the exercise facility at any time, and Landlord 
reserves the right to deny access to the exercise facility to anyone due to 
misuse of the facility or noncompliance with rules and regulations of the 
facility. To the extent permitted by Law, Tenant hereby indemnifies, and 
agrees to protect, defend and hold the Indemnitees harmless, against any 
and all actions, claims, demands, liability, costs and expenses, including 
attorneys fees and expenses for the defense thereof, arising from use of 
the exercise facility in the Project by Tenant, Tenants employees or 
invitees. In case of any action or proceeding brought against the 
Indemnitees by reason of any such claim, upon notice from Landlord, Tenant 
covenants to defend such action or proceeding by counsel chosen by 
Landlord, in Landlords sole discretion. Landlord reserves the right to 
settle, compromise or dispose of any and all actions, claims and demands 
related to the foregoing indemnity.


ARTICLE TWENTY-SIX-
MISCELLANEOUS
 
26.01       	LATE CHARGES


  (a)       The Monthly Base Rent, Rent Adjustments and Rent Adjustment 
Deposits shall be due when and as specifically provided above. Except for 
such payments and late charges described below, which late charge shall be 
due when provided below (without notice or demand), all other payments 
required hereunder to Landlord shall be paid within ten (10) days after 
Landlords demand therefor. All Rent and charges, except late charges, not 
paid when due shall bear interest from the date due until the date paid at 
the Default Rate in effect on the date such payment was due.


  (b)       In the event Tenant is more than five (5) days late in paying 
any installment of Rent due under this Lease, Tenant shall pay Landlord a 
late charge equal to five percent (5%) of the delinquent installment of 
Rent. The parties agree that (i) such delinquency will cause Landlord to 
incur costs and expenses not contemplated herein, the exact amount of which 
will be difficult to calculate, including the cost and expense that will be 
incurred by Landlord in processing each delinquent payment of rent by 
Tenant, and (ii) the amount of such late charge represents a reasonable 
estimate of such costs and expenses and that such late charge shall be paid 
to Landlord for each delinquent payment in addition to all Rent otherwise 
due hereunder. The parties further agree that the payment of late charges 
and the payment of interest provided for in subparagraph (a) above are 
distinct and separate from one another in that the payment of interest is 
to compensate Landlord for its inability to use the money improperly 
withheld by Tenant, while the payment of late charges is to compensate 
Landlord for its additional administrative expenses in handling and 
processing delinquent payments.
 
27

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 
  (c) Payment of interest at the Default Rate and/or of late charges shall 
not excuse or cure any default by Tenant under this Lease, nor shall the 
foregoing provisions of this Article or any such payments prevent Landlord 
from exercising any right or remedy available to Landlord upon Tenants 
failure to pay Rent when due, including the right to terminate this Lease.
 
26.02       	NO JURY TRIAL; VENUE; JURISDICTION


To the extent permitted by Law, each party hereto (which includes any 
assignee, successor, heir or personal representative of a party) shall not 
seek a jury trial, hereby waives trial by jury, and hereby further waives 
any objection to venue in the County in which the Project is located, and 
agrees and consents to personal jurisdiction of the courts of the State of 
California, in any action or proceeding or counterclaim brought by any 
party hereto against the other on any matter whatsoever arising out of or 
in any way connected with this Lease, the relationship of Landlord and 
Tenant, Tenants use or occupancy of the Premises, or any claim of injury 
or damage, or the enforcement of any remedy under any statute, emergency or 
otherwise, whether any of the foregoing is based on this Lease or on tort 
law. No party will seek to consolidate any such action in which a jury has 
been waived with any other action in which a jury trial cannot or has not 
been waived. It is the intention of the parties that these provisions shall 
be subject to no exceptions. By execution of this Lease the parties agree 
that this provision may be filed by any party hereto with the clerk or 
judge before whom any action is instituted, which filing shall constitute 
the written consent to a waiver of jury trial pursuant to and in accordance 
with Section 631 of the California Code of Civil Procedure. No party has in 
any way agreed with or represented to any other party that the provisions 
of this Section will not be fully enforced in all instances. The provisions 
of this Section shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this 
Lease.
 
26.03       	DEFAULT UNDER OTHER LEASE


It shall be a Default under this Lease if Tenant or any Affiliate holding 
any other lease with Landlord for premises in the Project defaults under 
such lease and as a result thereof such lease is terminated or terminable.
 
26.04       	OPTION


This Lease shall not become effective as a lease or otherwise until 
executed and delivered by both Landlord and Tenant. The submission of the 
Lease to Tenant does not constitute a reservation of or option for the 
Premises, but when executed by Tenant and delivered to Landlord, the Lease 
shall constitute an irrevocable offer by Tenant in effect for fifteen (15) 
days to lease the Premises on the terms and conditions herein contained.
 
26.05       	AUTHORITY


Tenant and Landlord, and each entity and individual executing this Lease on 
behalf of Tenant or Landlord, represents and warrants to Landlord and 
Tenant, respectively, that each has full authority and power to enter into 
this Lease on behalf of Tenant and Landlord, respectively, and that each of 
Tenant and Landlord has full power and authority to perform its obligations 
under this Lease, and that no consent or authorization is necessary from

expense, reinforce the floor as required for such excess loading.


8.5.       Work Stoppages. If any work on the Real Property other than 
Tenant Work is delayed, stopped or otherwise affected by construction of 
Tenant Work, Tenant shall immediately take those actions necessary or 
desirable to eliminate such delay, stoppage or effect on work on the Real 
Property other than Tenant Work.


8.6.       Life Safety. Tenant (or Contractor) shall employ the services of 
a fire and life-safety subcontractor reasonably satisfactory to Landlord

shall have access at reasonable times and upon advance notice and 
coordination with the Building management, to the Premises for the purpose 
of planning Tenant Work. Such access shall not in any manner interfere with

connection with it, shall be subject to and governed by all other 
provisions of the Lease, including, without limitation, Tenants 
indemnification obligations, insurance obligations, etc, except for the

completed but for such access.


8.10.       Fee. Landlord shall receive a fee equal to one percent (1.0%)

RIDER 2
ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS


This Rider 2 (Rider) is attached to and a part of a certain Lease by 
Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, a New York corporation, as Landlord, 
and AcelRx Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Delaware corporation, as Tenant, for 
the Premises as described therein (the Lease).


SECTION 1.       DEFINED TERMS; FORCE AND EFFECT


Capitalized terms used in this Rider shall have the same meanings set forth 
in the Lease except as otherwise specified herein and except for terms 
capitalized in the ordinary course of punctuation. This Rider forms a part 
of the Lease. Should any inconsistency arise between this Rider and any 
other provision of the Lease as to the specific matters which are the 
subject of this Rider, the terms and conditions of this Rider shall 
control.


SECTION 2.       CONDITION OF PREMISES; DELIVERY; CONSTRUCTION PERIOD; 
COMMENCEMENT DATE; TERM


2.1.       Projected Delivery Date; Delivery Date; Commencement Date: 
Tenants Obligations During Construction Period; Term.


(a)       Landlord shall tender to Tenant possession of the Premises in the 
condition specified in the Workletter no later than one (1) business day 
after execution of this Lease by both Tenant and Landlord (the Projected 
Delivery Date). On the date Landlord actually tenders to Tenant possession 
of the Premises (the Delivery Date), all the terms and conditions of the 
Lease shall apply, and Tenant shall observe and perform all terms and 
conditions of the Lease, including all that are specified to apply during 
the Term (for example only, Tenants insurance and indemnification 
obligations), except that during the period (the Construction Period) 
from the Delivery Date until the Commencement Date (defined below), in 
recognition of Tenants construction and installations in, and preparation 
of, the Premises for the use and occupancy permitted by this Lease: (i) 
Tenant shall not be obligated to pay Monthly Base Rent, Rent Adjustment 
Deposits or Rent Adjustments; and (ii) Landlord shall not be obligated to 
provide services or utilities except if and to the extent expressly 
provided in Section 4 of the Workletter. The Term of this Lease shall be as 
shown in Section 1.01(5) of the Basic Lease Provisions and the Commencement 
Date of the Term shall be the date which is the earlier to occur of (i) the 
date Tenant commences its business operations in the Premises, or (ii) 
ninety (90) days after the Delivery Date.


(b)       Upon request by Landlord, Tenant and Landlord shall enter into an 
agreement (the form of which is attached to this Lease as Rider 1) 
confirming the Commencement Date and the Expiration Date. If Tenant fails 
to enter into such agreement, then the Commencement Date and the Expiration 
Date shall be the dates designated by Landlord in such agreement.


2.2       Failure to Deliver Possession. If Landlord shall be unable to 
give possession of the Premises on the Projected Delivery Date by reason of 
the following: (i) the holding over or retention of possession of any 
tenant, tenants or occupants, or (ii) the Landlord Work, if any, is not 
Substantially Complete, or (iii) for any other reason, then Landlord shall 
not be subject to any liability for the failure to give possession on said 
date so long as Landlord has used and continues to use reasonable efforts 
to deliver possession to Tenant as soon as possible. Under such 
circumstances, by operation of Section 2.1 above and/or the definition of 
the Commencement Date, the Delivery Date and Commencement Date are 
automatically adjusted and determined in relation to the date Landlord 
actually tenders possession of the Premises to Tenant. No such failure to 
deliver possession on the originally scheduled Projected Delivery Date 
shall affect the validity of this Lease or the obligations of the Tenant 
hereunder.


SECTION 3.       MONUMENT SIGNAGE.


3.1       Grant of Right. Notwithstanding any provision of Section 6.06 of 
the Lease to the contrary, so long as Tenant is in continuous operation at 
and occupancy of at least fifty percent (50%) of the entire Premises, 
Tenant shall have the right, to place Tenant identification on one line of 
one existing, exterior monument sign for the Building, subject to the terms 
and conditions of this Section (Exterior Sign Right).


3.2       General Conditions & Requirements. The size, type, style, 
materials, color, method of installation and exact location of the sign, 
and the contractor for and all work in connection with the sign, 
contemplated by this Section shall (i) be subject to Tenants compliance 
with all applicable laws, regulations and ordinances and with any 
covenants, conditions and restrictions of record which affect the Property; 
(ii) be subject to Tenants compliance with all requirements of Landlords 
current Project signage criteria at the time of installation; (iii) be 
consistent with the design of the Building and the Project; (iv) be further 
subject to Landlords prior written consent. Tenant shall, at its sole cost 
and expense, procure, install, maintain and remove such sign.


3.3       Removal & Restoration. Upon the expiration or termination of the 
Exterior Sign Right, but in no event later than the expiration of the Term 
or earlier termination of the Lease, Tenant shall, at its sole cost and 
expense, remove such sign and shall repair and restore the area in which 
the sign was located to its condition prior to installation of such sign.


3.4       Right Personal. The Exterior Sign Right under this Section is 
personal to AcelRx Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and may 
not be used by, and shall not be transferable or assignable (voluntarily or 
involuntarily) to any person or entity other than an assignee of the Lease 
which has satisfied the requirements of Article Ten of the Lease.
