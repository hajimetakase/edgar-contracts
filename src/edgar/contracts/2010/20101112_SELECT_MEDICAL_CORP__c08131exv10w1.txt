  Agreement dated August 10, 2005 (as amended by the First Addendum dated

  square feet of space in the building located at 4720 Gettysburg Rd.,
  Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania for Suites 103,104, and 202. All capitalized
  terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to
  them in the Lease.
