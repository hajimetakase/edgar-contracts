(c)  
Transfer of Technology to External Manufacturing Source.  If the Parties 
mutually agree to secure external manufacturing sources other than the 
Yokkaichi Facility through joint investment, Flash Forward and Toshiba, as 
applicable, will jointly transfer the applicable manufacturing technology 
and know-how to such source.  Flash Forward, Flash Alliance and Flash 
Partners will conduct all negotiations with the external manufacturing 
source; provided, however, the terms and conditions of any agreement shall 
be subject to prior consultation with and the approval of Toshiba.  In 
connection with any technology transfer to such external source, Toshiba 
will be reimbursed its mutually agreed transfer costs for assisting in the 
transfer of manufacturing technology and know-how.  If the new capacity 
secured at such external manufacturing source is requested by only one of 
the Parties, such Party will pay the transfer costs and be entitled to 
purchase the full output of Flash Forward products purchased by Flash 
Alliance, Flash Partners or Flash Forward, as applicable, from such 
external manufacturing source.  If both Parties request such new external 
capacity, then Flash Alliance, Flash Partners or Flash Forward, as 
applicable, will pay the transfer costs to Toshiba.  Unless otherwise 
agreed by the Parties in writing, neither Party shall have the right to 
grant manufacturing licenses to such external manufacturing source or to 
disclose or transfer to any such external manufacturing source, 
manufacturing know-how related to the manufacture of Flash Forward 
products, except through Flash Alliance, Flash Partners or Flash Forward.

Exhibit 10.1
FOIA Confidential Treatment Requested
Execution Version
 
6.6  
Capacity Sharing Arrangement.
 
(a)  
Equal right to Joint Venture capacity.  Each of the Parties will have the 
right and obligation, through Flash Forward, to utilize fifty percent (50%) 
of the JV Space products, on an Equivalent Lot basis.  The actual monthly 
NAND Flash Memory Product lot output from the Y5 Facility shall be 
allocated between Toshiba and SanDisk, as applicable, based on the Y5 NAND 
Capacity Ratio.
 
(b)  
Alternative use of allotted capacity.
 
(i)  
If a Party is unable to utilize its allotted manufacturing capacity for JV 
Y5 NAND Flash Memory Products (such Party, an “Excess Capacity” or “EC 
Party”), it may do any of the following:
 
(A)  
An EC Party may request the other Party to negotiate the terms of transfer 
of its capacity shortfall to the other Party, which may choose whether to 
accept such additional capacity and on what terms in its sole discretion.
 
(B)  
An EC Party may use its capacity for Embedded NAND Products, as defined in 
and subject to Section ‎6.6(c).
 
(C)  
An EC Party may use its capacity for Proprietary NAND Flash Memory Products 
and non-Proprietary NAND Flash Memory Products, in accordance with and 
subject to Sections ‎6.6(d) and ‎(e).
 
(D)  
An EC Party may produce less than one hundred percent (100%) of its total 
Equivalent Lot capacity, provided its allocation of costs in this case will 
be done in accordance with Section 7.4(a)(i) (“EC Compensation”).
 
(ii)  
If both Parties are EC Parties because demand for both Parties’ JV Y5 NAND 
Flash Memory Products are significantly below expectations, the Parties 
will discuss in good faith whether to permit products which are not JV Y5 
NAND Flash Memory Products to be produced in the JV Space; provided that 
(A) the inability of the Parties to so agree shall not constitute a 
Deadlock (as defined in the FF Operating Agreement) and (B) the foregoing 
shall not limit either Party’s rights in the remainder of this Section ‎
6.6.
 
(c)  
Either Party shall have the right to use a portion of its total allocated 
capacity with respect to the JV Space to run a memory product which is not 
a JV Y5 NAND Flash Memory Product (solely because the NAND flash memory 
array area is equal to or less than **** of the total die area (“Embedded 
NAND Product”)) so long as such Embedded NAND Product ****.  If a Party 
exercises its option to run Embedded NAND Products, it must ****.  No such 
products may be run if doing so ****.  The conditions stated in Sections ‎
6.6(d) and ‎(e) do not apply to Embedded NAND Products.

(d)  
Each Party may use a portion of its total allocated capacity from the JV 
Space to cause to be manufactured NAND Flash Memory Products which are 
proprietary to that Party (“Proprietary NAND Flash Memory Products”) and 
which need not be shared with the other Party.  Proprietary NAND Flash 
Memory Products may be produced in the JV Space so long as such products 
****.  If a Party exercises such option, it must ****.  No such Proprietary 
NAND Flash Memory Products may be run if doing so ****.  Each Party shall 
give the other Party at least ninety (90) days’ advance written notice of 
its intention to use a portion of its allocated capacity to manufacture 
Proprietary NAND Flash Memory Products and the Parties shall refer the 
matter to the Board of Executive Officers (as defined in the FF Operating 
Agreement) for consultation and planning, with the intention to minimize 
the impact of such allocation.  Such notifying Party will limit the output 
volume of such Proprietary NAND Flash Memory Products to **** unless it 
receives the consent of the other Party to an increase in such output 
volume above such limit.
 
(e)  
Each Party (the “Originating Party”) shall inform the other (the “
Non-Originating Party”) of the development plans by the Originating Party 
to develop NAND Flash Memory Products, and the Originating Party and the 
Non-Originating Party shall each refer such matter to the Coordinating 
Committee (as defined in the Product Development Agreement).  If the 
Coordinating Committee unanimously decides that such planned development 
shall be undertaken jointly, then the cost of such joint development shall 
be borne by each Party in accordance with the Product Development Agreement 
or JMDY Agreement, as applicable, and the NAND Flash Memory Products 
manufactured following such joint development shall be considered 
non-Proprietary NAND Flash Memory Products for purposes of Section ‎6.6(d)
; provided, however, the NAND Flash Memory Products set forth in Exhibit A 
to the Product Development Agreement shall be deemed to be non-Proprietary 
NAND Flash Memory Products without any action by the Coordinating 
Committee.  Subject to the foregoing, if the Coordinating Committee does 
not unanimously decide that such planned development shall be undertaken 
jointly, then the Originating Party may, at its sole discretion, either (i) 
transfer to the Non-Originating Party the technology, including the items 
in Exhibit C to the Product Development Agreement relating to such 
technology, used to manufacture such NAND Flash Memory Products on a 
royalty-free basis, whereupon such NAND Flash Memory Products shall be 
considered non-Proprietary NAND Flash Memory Products, or (ii) treat such 
NAND Flash Memory Products as Proprietary NAND Flash Memory Products for 
purposes of Section ‎6.6(d).  In the event the Originating Party elects to 
treat any NAND Flash Memory Products as Proprietary NAND Flash Memory 
Products in accordance with the preceding sentence, but thereafter the 
Coordinating Committee unanimously determines that such Proprietary NAND 
Flash Memory Products should be developed jointly, the Originating Party 
shall transfer to the other Party the technology used to manufacture such 
NAND Flash Memory Products on reasonable terms and conditions to be 
mutually agreed upon by the Parties, whereupon such Proprietary NAND Flash 
Memory Products shall be treated as non-Proprietary NAND Flash Memory 
Products.

Financing.
 
(a)  
****.
 
(b)  
The Parties currently intend, but are not obligated, to structure the 
financing for equipment purchases by Flash Forward necessary to effect the 
ramp-up as follows:
 
(i)  
Flash Forward will enter into equipment lease or loan agreements and pledge 
the financed equipment as collateral;
 
(ii)  
Flash Forward will secure external financing for approximately **** of the 
initial purchase price of its tools and each Party will provide equity 
capital contributions and loans (on a subordinated basis) for the remaining 
cash requirements of Flash Forward necessary to effect the ramp-up;
 
(iii)  
each Party will severally and not jointly and through separate arrangements 
guarantee as close as possible to fifty percent (50%) of Flash Forward’s 
obligations under such lease or loan agreements (any financing separately 
guaranteed or provided by Toshiba for Flash Forward or otherwise for 
investment in the Y5 Facility, “Toshiba Financing”, any such financing 
separately guaranteed or provided by SanDisk for Flash Forward or otherwise 
for investment in the Y5 Facility “SanDisk Financing” and the Toshiba 
Financing and SanDisk Financing, each a “Financing”); and
 
(iv)  
the Parties will attempt to obtain the foregoing financing from the same 
financial institution, but under separate agreements that expressly 
disclaim any joint and several liability of the Parties.
 
(c)  
With respect to any Toshiba Financing or SanDisk Financing, the following 
shall apply:
 
(i)  
****.
 
(ii)  
Unless otherwise expressly agreed by both Parties in writing in each case, 
all Toshiba Financing and all SanDisk Financing shall create only several 
obligations of the Parties and no joint and several obligations or 
liability.  Toshiba (with respect to Toshiba Financing) and SanDisk (with 
respect to SanDisk Financing) hereby indemnifies and holds harmless the 
other Party and its Indemnified Parties from any claims by any financial 
institution or other Person that the other Party has any liabilities or 
obligations with respect to, respectively, any Toshiba Financing or SanDisk 
Financing (unless joint liability has been agreed pursuant to the first 
sentence of this Section ‎6.12(c)(ii)).
 
(iii)  
Flash Forward will use commercially reasonable efforts to comply with the 
requirements of any financing sources.  Flash Forward will make available 
to each Party one-half of its assets (with as near as practicable cost, 
collateral value and type) to secure such Party’s Financing (whether 
external or loans from a Party or its Affiliates).
 
(d)  
If the lender under the Financing for either Party (as the “Defaulting 
Party”) takes significant actions to enforce its right in the collateral, 
then the other Party (as the “Non-Defaulting Party”) shall have the right, 
but not the obligation, to cure the default giving rise to the lender’s 
enforcement action.  If the Non-Defaulting Party exercises such cure right, 
then the Non-Defaulting Party’s rights in any subject collateral shall be 
superior to the Defaulting Party’s and the Non-Defaulting Party may 
exercise one of the following options:
 
(i)  
the Non-Defaulting Party (A) shall have a claim against the Defaulting 
Party for reimbursement of any payments made by the Non-Defaulting Party on 
the Defaulting Party’s behalf (which will be subordinate to the lender’s 
claims and bear interest at a rate 500 basis points in excess of the rate 
being charged by the lender to the Defaulting Party) and (B) shall have the 
right, until and unless the Defaulting Party pays in full the obligation to 
the Non-Defaulting Party under foregoing clause (A), to take over the 
increment of production of the Y5 Facility represented by the collateral 
with respect to which the lender took significant actions to enforce its 
rights; or
 
(ii)  
the Non-Defaulting Party shall have the right to terminate the Operating 
Agreement pursuant to Section 11.6 thereof (foreclosure default).

signed by each party hereto.  Any failure of a party to comply with any 
obligation, covenant, agreement or condition contained in this Agreement 
may be waived by the party entitled to the benefits thereof only by a 
written instrument duly executed and delivered by the party granting such 
waiver, but such waiver or failure to insist upon strict compliance with 
such obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a 
waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure of 
compliance.
 
2.2 Severability.  If any provision of this Agreement or the application of 
any such provision is invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any 
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not 
affect any other provision of this Agreement (except as may be expressly 
provided in this Agreement) or invalidate or render unenforceable such 
provision in any other jurisdiction.  To the extent permitted by applicable 
law, the parties hereto waive any provision of law that renders any 
provision of this Agreement invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any 
respect.  The parties hereto shall, to the extent lawful and practicable,

2.14 Non Disclosure Obligations.  Each party hereto agrees as follows:
 
(a) In this Agreement, “Confidential Information” means information

Information disclosed by one Party (the “Disclosing Party”) hereunder, the 
receiving Party (the “Receiving Party”) agrees to safeguard the 
Confidential Information and to keep it in confidence and to use reasonable 
efforts, consistent with those used in the protection of its own 
confidential information, to prevent its disclosure to third parties,
