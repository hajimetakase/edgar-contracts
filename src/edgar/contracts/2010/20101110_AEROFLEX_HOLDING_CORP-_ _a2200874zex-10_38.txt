NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as follows, effective as of the 
date hereof:
 
        1.             The last sentence of Section 6 of the Agreement is
        hereby amended and restated, which shall read in its entirety as
        follows:

        accordance with the normal payroll practices of the Company.
         
        2.             Section 8(e)(iii) is hereby amended and restated,
        which shall read in its entirety as follows:
         
        (iii)  In the event of Termination Without Cause, the Employee

        3.             A new Section 8(k) of the Agreement is hereby added,
        which shall read in its entirety as follows:
         
        (k) Payments; Compliance with Section 409A of the Code. 
        Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if (i) the
        Employee is to receive payments or benefits under Section 8 by
        reason of his separation from service (as such term is defined in
        Section 409A of the Code) other than as a result of his death, (ii)
        the Employee is a specified employee within the meaning of Code
        Section 409A for the period in which the payment or benefits would
        otherwise commence, and (iii) such payment or benefit would
        otherwise subject the Employee to any tax, interest or penalty
        imposed under Section 409A of the Code (or any regulation
        promulgated thereunder) if the payment or benefit would commence
        within six months of a termination of the Employees employment,
        then such payment or benefit required under Section 8 shall not
        commence until the first day which is at least six months after the
        termination of the Employees employment.  Such payments or
        benefits, which would have otherwise been required to be made over
        such six month period, shall be paid to the Employee in one lump
        sum payment or otherwise provided to the Employee as soon as
        administratively feasible after the first day which is at least six
        months after the termination of the Employees employment. 
        Thereafter, the payments and benefits shall continue, if
        applicable, for the relevant period set forth in Section 8.  For
        purposes of this Agreement, all references to termination of
        employment and other similar language shall be deemed to refer to
        the Employees separation from service as defined in Treasury
        Regulation Section 1.409A-1(h).
         
4.             Except as specifically provided in and modified by this 
Amendment, the Agreement is in all other respects hereby ratified and 
confirmed and references to the Agreement shall be deemed to refer to the 
Agreement as modified by this Amendment.
 
5.             This Amendment may be executed in two or more counterparts, 
each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which taken together 
shall constitute one and the same instrument.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned have executed this Amendment as of the 
day and year first above written.
