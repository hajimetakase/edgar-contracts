  EXHIBIT 10.3

  INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT

  INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT (this Agreement), made and executed as of
  September 27, 2010, by and between Oasis Petroleum Inc., a Delaware
  corporation (the Company) and Nickolas J. Lorentzatos, an individual
  resident of the State of Texas (the Indemnitee).

  WITNESSETH:

  WHEREAS, the Company is aware that, to induce and to retain highly
  competent persons to serve the Company as directors or officers or in
  other capacities, the Company must provide such persons with adequate
  protection through insurance and indemnification against inordinate risks
  of claims and actions against them arising out of their service to and
  activities on behalf of the Company;

  WHEREAS, the Company recognizes the substantial increase in corporate
  litigation in general, subjecting directors and officers to expensive
  litigation risks at the same time as the availability and coverage of
  liability insurance has been severely limited;

  WHEREAS, the Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company (the Bylaws)
  contain indemnification provisions which entitle the members of the Board
  of Directors and officers of the Company to indemnification protection to
  the fullest extent permitted by applicable law; and

  WHEREAS, it is reasonable, prudent and necessary for the Company to
  obligate itself contractually to indemnify such persons to the fullest
  extent permitted by applicable law and to provide an express process and
  procedure for seeking indemnification so that they will continue to serve
  the Company free from undue concern.

  AGREEMENT:

  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual promises
  and covenants contained herein, and for other good and valuable
  consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
  acknowledged, the Company and the Indemnitee do hereby agree as follows:

  1. DEFINITIONS. For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall
  have the meanings set forth below:

  (a) Disinterested Director shall mean a director of the Company who is
  not or was not a party to the Proceeding in respect of which
  indemnification is being sought.

  (b) Expenses shall include all reasonable attorneys fees, accountants
  fees, retainers, court costs, transcript costs, fees of experts, witness
  fees, travel expenses, duplicating costs, printing and binding costs,
  telephone charges, postage, delivery service fees, and all other
  disbursements or expenses incurred in connection with prosecuting,
  defending, preparing to prosecute or defend, investigating or being or
  preparing to be a witness in any Proceeding or establishing the
  Indemnitees right of entitlement to indemnification for any of the
  foregoing.

  (c) Independent Counsel shall mean a law firm of at least 50 attorneys
  or a member of a law firm of at least 50 attorneys that is experienced in
  matters of corporate law and that neither is presently nor in the past
  five years has been retained to represent (i) the Company or the
  Indemnitee or any affiliate thereof in any matter material to either such
  party or (ii) any other party to the Proceeding giving rise to a claim
  for indemnification hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term
  Independent Counsel shall not include any person who, under the
  applicable standards of professional conduct then prevailing, would have
  a conflict of interest in representing either the Company or the
  Indemnitee in an action to determine the Indemnitees right to
  indemnification under this Agreement.

   

   

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

  (d) Proceeding shall mean any threatened, pending or completed action,
  suit, arbitration, investigation, inquiry, alternate dispute resolution
  mechanism, administrative or legislative hearing, or any other proceeding
  (including, without limitation, any securities laws action, suit,
  arbitration, investigation, inquiry, alternative dispute resolution
  mechanism, hearing or procedure) whether civil, criminal, administrative,
  arbitrative or investigative and whether or not based upon events
  occurring, or actions taken, before the date hereof, and any appeal in or
  related to any such action, suit, arbitration, investigation, inquiry,
  alternate dispute resolution mechanism, hearing or proceeding and any
  inquiry or investigation (including discovery), whether conducted by or
  in the right of the Company or any other person, that the Indemnitee in
  good faith believes could lead to any such action, suit, arbitration,
  investigation, inquiry, alternative dispute resolution mechanism, hearing
  or other proceeding or appeal thereof.

  2. SERVICE BY THE INDEMNITEE. The Indemnitee agrees to serve or to
  continue to serve as a director or officer of the Company and will
  discharge his/her duties and responsibilities to the best of his/her
  ability so long as the Indemnitee is duly elected or appointed in
  accordance with the provisions of the Companys Amended and Restated
  Certificate of Incorporation (the Certificate), the Bylaws, and the
  Delaware General Corporation Law, as amended (the DGCL), or until
  his/her earlier death, retirement, resignation or removal, or also in the
  case of a director, until his/her successor shall have been duly elected
  and qualified. The Indemnitee may at any time and for any reason resign
  from such position (subject to any other obligation, whether contractual
  or imposed by operation of law), in which event this Agreement shall
  continue in full force and effect after such resignation. Additionally,
  this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect after the death,
  retirement or removal of the Indemnitee, or also in the case of a
  director, until his/her successor shall have been duly elected and
  qualified. Notwithstanding the forgoing, this Agreement may be terminated
  in accordance with Section 22 hereof. Nothing in this Agreement shall
  confer upon the Indemnitee the right to continue in the employ of the
  Company or as a director of the Company, or affect the right of the
  Company to terminate, in the Companys sole discretion (with or without
  cause) and at any time, the Indemnitees employment or position as a
  director, in each case, subject to any contractual rights of the
  Indemnitee existing otherwise than under this Agreement.

  3. INDEMNIFICATION. The Company shall indemnify the Indemnitee and
  advance Expenses to the Indemnitee as provided in this Agreement to the
  fullest extent permitted by the Certificate, the Bylaws in effect as of
  the date hereof and the DGCL or other applicable law in effect on the
  date hereof and to any greater extent that the Bylaws, the DGCL, or
  applicable law may in the future from time to time permit. Without
  diminishing the scope of the indemnification provided by this Section 3,
  the rights of indemnification of the Indemnitee provided hereunder shall
  include, but shall not be limited to, those rights hereinafter set forth,
  except that no indemnification shall be paid hereunder to the Indemnitee:

  (a) on account of conduct of the Indemnitee which is adjudged in a final
  adjudication by a court of competent jurisdiction from which there is no
  further right of appeal or in a final adjudication of an arbitration
  pursuant to Section 12 hereof, if the Indemnitee elects to seek such
  arbitration, to have been knowingly fraudulent or to constitute conduct
  not in good faith, or in the case of a criminal matter, to have been
  knowingly unlawful;

   

   

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

  (b) in any circumstance where such indemnification is expressly
  prohibited by applicable law in effect as of the date of this Agreement
  or subsequently determined to be expressly prohibited by applicable law;

  (c) with respect to liability for which payment is actually made to the
  Indemnitee under an insurance policy or under an indemnity clause, Bylaws
  provision or other agreement (other than this Agreement), except in
  respect of any liability in excess of payment under such insurance,
  clause, Bylaws provision or other agreement; or

  (d) if a final decision by a court having jurisdiction in the matter
  shall determine that such indemnification is not lawful.

  4. ACTIONS OR PROCEEDINGS OTHER THAN AN ACTION BY OR IN THE RIGHT OF THE
  COMPANY. The Indemnitee shall be entitled to the indemnification rights
  provided in this Agreement if the Indemnitee was or is a party or is
  threatened to be made a party to any Proceeding, other than a Proceeding
  by or in the right of the Company, by reason of the fact that the
  Indemnitee is or was a director, officer, employee, agent or fiduciary of
  the Company or any of the Companys direct or indirect wholly-owned
  subsidiaries, or is or was serving at the request of the Company or any
  of the Companys direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries as a
  director, officer, employee, agent or fiduciary of any other entity,
  including, but not limited to, another corporation, partnership, limited
  liability company, employee benefit plan, joint venture, trust or other
  enterprise, or by reason of any act or omission by him/her in such
  capacity. Pursuant to this Section 4, the Indemnitee shall be indemnified
  against all judgments, penalties (including, but not limited to, excise
  and similar taxes) and fines against the Indemnitee, and all Expenses,
  liabilities and amounts paid in settlement which were actually and
  reasonably incurred by, or in the case of retainers, to be incurred by,
  the Indemnitee or on the Indemnitees behalf in connection with such
  Proceeding (including, but not limited to, the investigation, defense or
  appeal thereof).

  5. ACTIONS BY OR IN THE RIGHT OF THE COMPANY. The Indemnitee shall be
  entitled to the indemnification rights provided in this Agreement if the
  Indemnitee was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any
  Proceeding brought by or in the right of the Company to procure a
  judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that the Indemnitee is or was
  a director, officer, employee, agent or fiduciary of the Company or any
  of the Companys direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries, or is or
  was serving at the request of the Company or any of the Companys direct
  or indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries as a director, officer, employee,
  agent or fiduciary of another entity, including, but not limited to,
  another corporation, partnership, limited liability company, employee
  benefit plan, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or by reason of
  any act or omission by him/her in any such capacity. Pursuant to this
  Section 5, the Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all Expenses
  actually and reasonably incurred by, or in the case of retainers, to be
  incurred by, him/her in connection with such Proceeding (including, but
  not limited to the investigation, defense or appeal thereof); provided,
  however, that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim,
  issue or matter as to which the Indemnitee shall have been  adjudged to
  be liable to the Company in a final adjudication by a court of competent
  jurisdiction from which there is no further right of appeal or in a final
  adjudication of an arbitration pursuant to Section 12 hereof, if the
  Indemnitee elects to seek such arbitration, unless and to the extent that
  the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or the court in which
  such Proceeding shall have been brought or is pending, shall determine
  that such indemnification may be made.

   

   

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

  6. GOOD FAITH DEFINITION. For purposes of this Agreement, the Indemnitee
  shall be deemed to have acted in good faith and in a manner the
  Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best
  interests of the Company, or, with respect to any criminal Proceeding, to
  have had no reasonable cause to believe the Indemnitees conduct was
  unlawful, if such action was based on any of the following: (a) the
  records or books of the account of the Company or other enterprise,
  including financial statements; (b) information supplied to the
  Indemnitee by the officers of the Company or any of the Companys direct
  or indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries or any entity at which the
  Indemnitee is or was serving as a director, officer, employee, agent or
  fiduciary at the request of the Company or any of the Companys direct or
  indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries (each such entity, a Subject
  Enterprise) in the course of his/her duties; (c) the advice of legal
  counsel for the Company or Subject Enterprise; or (d) information or
  records given in reports made to the Company or Subject Enterprise by an
  independent certified public accountant or by an appraiser or other
  expert selected with reasonable care by the Company or other enterprise.
  The provisions of this Section 6 shall not be deemed to be exclusive or
  to limit in any way the other circumstances in which the Indemnitee may
  be deemed to have met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in
  this Agreement.

  7. INDEMNIFICATION FOR EXPENSES OF WITNESS. Notwithstanding the other
  provisions of this Agreement, to the extent that the Indemnitee has
  served on behalf of the Company or any of the Companys direct or
  indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries, or is or was serving at the request
  of the Company or any of the Companys direct or indirect wholly-owned
  subsidiaries, as a witness or other similar participant in any
  Proceeding, the Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all Expenses
  actually and reasonably incurred by, or in the case of retainers, to be
  incurred by, the Indemnitee in connection therewith to be paid by the
  Company within seven days of receipt by the Company of a statement from
  the Indemnitee requesting such payment and detailing such Expenses.

  8. PARTIAL INDEMNIFICATION. If the Indemnitee is entitled under any
  provision of this Agreement to indemnification by the Company for some or
  a portion of the judgments, penalties and fines and Expenses and amounts
  paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by, or in the case of
  retainers to be incurred by, the Indemnitee in connection with the
  investigation, defense, appeal or settlement of such Proceeding described
  in Sections 4 and 5 hereof, but is not entitled to indemnification for
  the total amount thereof, the Company shall nevertheless indemnify the
  Indemnitee for the portion of such judgments, penalties and fines and
  Expenses and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred
  by, or in the case of retainers, to be incurred by, the Indemnitee for
  which the Indemnitee is entitled to be indemnified. For purposes of this
  Section 8 and without limitation, the termination of any claim, issue, or
  matter in such a Proceeding described herein (a) by dismissal, summary
  judgment, judgment on the pleading, or final judgment, with or without
  prejudice, or (b) by agreement without payment or assumption or admission
  of liability by the Indemnitee, shall be deemed to be a successful
  determination or result as to such claim, issue or matter.

  9. PROCEDURE FOR DETERMINATION OF ENTITLEMENT TO INDEMNIFICATION.

  (a) To obtain indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnitee shall
  submit to the Company a written request, including documentation and
  information which is reasonably available to the Indemnitee and is
  reasonably necessary to determine whether the Indemnitee is entitled to
  indemnification. The Secretary of the Company shall, promptly upon
  receipt of a request for indemnification, advise the Board of Directors
  that the Indemnitee has requested indemnification. Any Expenses incurred
  by, or in the case of retainers, to be incurred by, the Indemnitee in
  connection with the Indemnitees request for indemnification hereunder
  shall be borne by the Company.

   

   

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

  (b) Upon written request by the Indemnitee for indemnification pursuant
  to Sections 4 and 5 hereof, the entitlement of the Indemnitee to
  indemnification pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be
  determined by the following person or persons, who shall be empowered to
  make such determination: (i) if requested by the Indemnitee, by
  Independent Counsel in a written opinion to the Board of Directors, a
  copy of which shall be delivered to the Indemnitee; or (ii) if not so
  requested, (A) by the Board of Directors of the Company, by a majority
  vote of a quorum (determined in accordance with the Bylaws) consisting of
  Disinterested Directors, or (B) if a quorum consisting of Disinterested
  Directors is not obtainable or if a majority vote of a quorum consisting
  of Disinterested Directors so directs, by Independent Counsel in a
  written opinion to the Board of Directors, a copy of which shall be
  delivered to the Indemnitee. The Independent Counsel shall be selected by
  the Board of Directors of the Company unless there shall have occurred
  within two years prior to the date of the commencement of the Proceeding
  for which indemnification is claimed a Change of Control as defined in
  the Companys 2010 Long Term Incentive Plan in which case the Independent
  Counsel shall be selected by the claimant unless the claimant shall
  request that such selection be made by the Board of Directors. Such
  determination of entitlement to indemnification shall be made not later
  than 45 days after receipt by the Company of a written request for
  indemnification. If it is so determined that the Indemnitee is entitled
  to indemnification, payment to the Indemnitee shall be made within 15
  days after such determination.

  (c) The Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification hereunder without
  a separate determination by or on behalf of the Company pursuant to
  Section 9(b) hereof with respect to any Proceeding and/or any claim,
  issue, or matter with respect thereto: (i) which is resolved by agreement
  without any payment or assumption or admission of liability by the
  Indemnitee; or (ii) as to which a final decision on the merits has been
  made by the court or other body with jurisdiction over that Proceeding,
  in which the Indemnitee was not determined to be liable with respect to
  such claim, issue, or matter asserted against the Indemnitee in the
  Proceeding; or (iii) as to which a court or arbitrator determines upon
  application that, despite such a determination of liability on the part
  of the Indemnitee, but in view of all the circumstances of the Proceeding
  and of the Indemnitees conduct with respect thereto, the Indemnitee is
  fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnification for such judgments,
  penalties, fines, amounts paid in settlement, and Expenses as such court
  or arbitrator shall deem proper; provided, however, such decision shall
  have been rendered in or with respect to the Proceeding for which the
  Indemnitee seeks indemnification under this Agreement.

  10. PRESUMPTIONS AND EFFECT OF CERTAIN PROCEEDINGS.

  (a) In making a determination with respect to entitlement to
  indemnification, the Indemnitee shall be presumed to be entitled to full
  indemnification hereunder, and the Company shall have the burden of proof
  in the making of any determination contrary to such presumption. Neither
  the failure of the Board of Directors (or such other person or persons
  empowered to make the determination of whether the Indemnitee is entitled
  to indemnification) to have made a determination prior to the
  commencement of any action pursuant to this Agreement that
  indemnification is proper in the circumstances because the Indemnitee has
  met the applicable standard of conduct, nor any determination thereby
  that the Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct,
  shall be a defense or admissible as evidence in any Proceeding for any
  purpose or create a presumption that the Indemnitee has acted in bad
  faith or failed to meet any other applicable standard of conduct.

  (b) If the Board of Directors or the Independent Counsel, as applicable,
  shall have failed to make a determination as to entitlement to
  indemnification within 45 days after receipt by the Company of such
  request, the requisite determination of entitlement to indemnification
  shall be deemed to have been made and the Indemnitee shall be absolutely
  entitled to such indemnification, absent actual and material fraud in the
  request for indemnification, a prohibition of indemnification under
  applicable law in effect as of the date of this Agreement, or a
  subsequent determination that such indemnification is prohibited by
  applicable law. The termination of any Proceeding described in Sections 4
  or 5 hereof by judgment, order, settlement or conviction, or upon a plea
  of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself: (i) create a
  presumption that the Indemnitee acted in bad faith or in a manner which
  he/she reasonably believed to be opposed to the best interests of the
  Company, or, with respect to any criminal Proceeding, that the Indemnitee
  has reasonable cause to believe that the Indemnitees conduct was
  unlawful; or (ii) otherwise adversely affect the rights of the Indemnitee
  to indemnification, except as may be provided herein.

   

   

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

  11. ADVANCEMENT OF EXPENSES. Subject to applicable law, all reasonable
  Expenses actually incurred by, or in the case of retainers, to be
  incurred by, the Indemnitee in connection with any Proceeding shall be
  paid by the Company in advance of the final disposition of such
  Proceeding, if so requested by the Indemnitee, within seven days after
  the receipt by the Company of a statement or statements from the
  Indemnitee requesting such advance or advances. The Indemnitee may submit
  such statements from time to time. The Indemnitees entitlement to such
  Expenses shall include those incurred, or in the case of retainers, to be
  incurred, in connection with any Proceeding by the Indemnitee seeking an
  adjudication or award in arbitration pursuant to this Agreement. Such
  statement or statements shall reasonably evidence the Expenses incurred
  by, or in the case of retainers, to be incurred by, the Indemnitee in
  connection therewith and shall include or be accompanied by a written
  affirmation by the Indemnitee of the Indemnitees good faith belief that
  the Indemnitee has met the standard of conduct necessary for
  indemnification under this Agreement and an undertaking by or on behalf
  of the Indemnitee to repay such amount if it is ultimately determined
  that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified against such
  Expenses by the Company pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise. The form
  of Written Affirmation is attached as Exhibit A hereto. Each written
  undertaking to pay amounts advanced must be an unlimited general
  obligation but need not be secured, and shall be accepted without
  reference to financial ability to make repayment.

  12. REMEDIES OF THE INDEMNITEE IN CASES OF DETERMINATION NOT TO INDEMNIFY
  OR FAILURE TO ADVANCE EXPENSES. In the event that a determination is made
  that the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification hereunder or if
  the payment has not been timely made following a determination of
  entitlement to indemnification pursuant to Sections 9 and 10 hereof, or
  if Expenses are not advanced pursuant to Section 11 hereof, the
  Indemnitee shall be entitled to seek a final adjudication in an
  appropriate court of the State of Delaware or any other court of
  competent jurisdiction of the Indemnitees entitlement to such
  indemnification or advance. Alternatively, the Indemnitee may, at the
  Indemnitees option, seek an award in arbitration to be conducted by a
  single arbitrator chosen by the Indemnitee and approved by the Company,
  which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. If the
  Indemnitee and the Company do not agree upon an arbitrator within 30 days
  following notice to the Company by the Indemnitee that it seeks an award
  in arbitration, the arbitrator will be chosen pursuant to the rules of
  the American Arbitration Association (the AAA). The arbitration will be
  conducted pursuant to the rules of the AAA, and an award shall be made
  within 60 days following the filing of the demand for arbitration. The
  arbitration shall be held in Houston, Texas. The Company shall not oppose
  the Indemnitees right to seek any such adjudication or award in
  arbitration or any other claim. Such judicial proceeding or arbitration
  shall be made de novo, and the Indemnitee shall not be prejudiced by
  reason of a determination (if so made) that the Indemnitee is not
  entitled to indemnification. If a determination is made or deemed to have
  been made pursuant to the terms of Section 9 or Section 10 hereof that
  the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, the Company shall be bound
  by such determination and shall be precluded from asserting that such
  determination has not been made or that the procedure by which such
  determination was made is not valid, binding and enforceable. The Company
  further agrees to stipulate in any such court or before any such
  arbitrator that the Company is bound by all the provisions of this
  Agreement and is precluded from making any assertions to the contrary. If
  the court or arbitrator shall determine that the Indemnitee is entitled
  to any indemnification hereunder, the Company shall pay all reasonable
  Expenses actually incurred by, or in the case of retainers to be incurred
  by, the Indemnitee in connection with such adjudication or award in
  arbitration (including, but not limited to, any appellate Proceedings).

   

   

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

  13. NOTIFICATION AND DEFENSE OF CLAIM. Promptly after receipt by the
  Indemnitee of notice of the commencement of any Proceeding, the
  Indemnitee will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the
  Company under this Agreement, notify the Company in writing of the
  commencement thereof. The omission or delay by the Indemnitee to so
  notify the Company will not relieve the Company from any liability that
  it may have to the Indemnitee under this Agreement or otherwise, except
  to the extent that the Company may suffer material prejudice by reason of
  such failure or delay. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
  Agreement, with respect to any such Proceeding as to which the Indemnitee
  gives notice to the Company of the commencement thereof:

  (a) The Company will be entitled to participate therein at its own
  expense.

  (b) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 13(b), to the extent
  that it may wish, the Company, jointly with any other indemnifying party
  similarly notified, shall be entitled to assume the defense thereof with
  counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee. After prior written
  notice from the Company to the Indemnitee of its election to so assume
  the defense thereof, the Company shall not be liable to the Indemnitee
  under this Agreement for any legal or other Expenses subsequently
  incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with the defense thereof other
  than reasonable costs of investigation or as otherwise provided below.
  The Indemnitee shall have the right to employ the Indemnitees own
  counsel in such Proceeding, but the fees and Expenses of such counsel
  incurred after such notice from the Company of its assumption of the
  defense thereof shall be at the expense of the Indemnitee unless (i) the
  employment of counsel by the Indemnitee has been authorized by the
  Company; (ii) the Indemnitee shall have reasonably concluded that there
  may be a conflict of interest between the Company and the Indemnitee in
  the conduct of the defense of such Proceeding, and such determination by
  the Indemnitee shall be supported by an opinion of counsel, which opinion
  shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company; or (iii) the Company shall
  not in fact have employed counsel to assume the defense of the
  Proceeding, in each of which cases the fees and Expenses of counsel shall
  be at the expense of the Company. The Company shall not be entitled to
  assume the defense of any Proceeding brought by or on behalf of the
  Company or as to which the Indemnitee shall have reached the conclusion
  provided for in clause (ii) above.

  (c) The Company shall not be liable to indemnify the Indemnitee under
  this Agreement for any amounts paid in settlement of any Proceeding
  without its prior written consent, which consent shall not be
  unreasonably withheld. The Company shall not be required to obtain the
  consent of the Indemnitee to settle any Proceeding which the Company has
  undertaken to defend if the Company assumes full and sole responsibility
  for such settlement and such settlement grants the Indemnitee a complete
  and unqualified release in respect of any potential liability. The
  Company shall have no obligation to indemnify the Indemnitee under this
  Agreement with regard to any judicial award issued in a Proceeding, or
  any related Expenses of the Indemnitee, if the Company was not given a
  reasonable and timely opportunity, at its expense, to participate in the
  defense of such Proceeding, except to the extent the Company was not
  materially prejudiced thereby.

  (d) If, at the time of the receipt of a notice of a claim pursuant to
  this Section 13, the Company has director and officer liability insurance
  in effect, the Company shall give prompt notice of the commencement of
  the Proceeding for which indemnification is sought to the insurers in
  accordance with the procedures set forth in the respective policies.

  The Company shall thereafter take all necessary or desirable action to
  cause such insurers to pay, on behalf of the Indemnitee, all amounts
  payable as a result of such Proceeding in accordance with the terms of
  the policies.

   

   

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

  14. OTHER RIGHTS TO INDEMNIFICATION. The indemnification and advancement
  of Expenses provided by this Agreement are cumulative, and not exclusive,
  and are in addition to any other rights to which the Indemnitee may now
  or in the future be entitled under any provision of the Bylaws or
  Certificate of the Company, or other governing documents of any direct or
  indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, any vote of the
  stockholders of the Company or Disinterested Directors, any provision of
  law or otherwise. Except as required by applicable law, the Company shall
  not adopt any amendment to its Bylaws or Certificate the effect of which
  would be to deny, diminish or encumber the Indemnitees right to
  indemnification under this Agreement.

  15. NO IMPUTATION. The knowledge or actions, or failure to act, of any
  director, officer, agent or employee of the Company or the Company itself
  shall not be imputed to the Indemnitee for purposes of determining the
  right to indemnification under this Agreement.

  16. DIRECTOR AND OFFICER LIABILITY INSURANCE. The Company shall, from
  time to time, make the good faith determination whether it is practicable
  for the Company to obtain and maintain a policy or policies of insurance
  with reputable insurance companies providing the officers and directors
  of the Company and any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the
  Company with coverage for losses from wrongful acts or to ensure the
  Companys performance of its indemnification obligations under this
  Agreement. Among other considerations, the Company will weigh the costs
  of obtaining such insurance coverage against the protection afforded by
  such coverage. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall have no
  obligation to obtain or maintain such insurance if the Company determines
  in good faith that such insurance is not necessary or is not reasonably
  available, if the premium costs for such insurance are disproportionate
  to the amount of coverage provided, if the coverage provided by such
  insurance is limited by exclusions so as to provide an insufficient
  benefit or if the Indemnitee is covered by similar insurance maintained
  by a direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. However,
  the Companys decision whether or not to adopt and maintain such
  insurance shall not affect in any way its obligations to indemnify the
  Indemnitee under this Agreement or otherwise. In all policies of director
  and officer liability insurance, the Indemnitee shall be named as an
  insured in such a manner as to provide the Indemnitee the same rights and
  benefits as are accorded to the most favorably insured of the Companys
  directors, if the Indemnitee is a director; or of the Companys officers,
  if the Indemnitee is not a director of the Company but is an officer. The
  Company agrees that the provisions of this Agreement shall remain in
  effect regardless of whether liability or other insurance coverage is at
  any time obtained or retained by the Company; except that any payments
  made to, or on behalf of, the Indemnitee under an insurance policy shall
  reduce the obligations of the Company hereunder with respect to the
  amount of such payment in accordance with Section 3(c) hereof.

  17. INTENT. This Agreement is intended to be broader than any statutory
  indemnification rights applicable in the State of Delaware and shall be
  in addition to and supplemental to any other rights the Indemnitee may
  have under the Certificate, the Bylaws, applicable law or otherwise. To
  the extent that a change in applicable law (whether by statute or
  judicial decision) permits greater indemnification by agreement than
  would be afforded currently under the Certificate, the Bylaws, applicable
  law or this Agreement, it is the intent of the parties that the
  Indemnitee enjoy by this Agreement the greater benefits so afforded by
  such change. To the extent there is any conflict between this Agreement
  and the Bylaws with respect to any right or obligation of any party
  hereto, the terms of this Agreement shall control; provided, however, the
  foregoing shall not apply to a reduction of any right of the Indemnitee.

  18. ATTORNEYS FEES AND OTHER EXPENSES TO ENFORCE AGREEMENT. In the event
  that the Indemnitee is subject to or intervenes in any Proceeding in
  which the validity or enforceability of this Agreement is at issue or
  seeks an adjudication or award in arbitration to enforce the Indemnitees
  rights under, or to recover damages for breach of, this Agreement the
  Indemnitee, if he/she prevails in whole or in part in such action, shall
  be entitled to recover from the Company and shall be indemnified by the
  Company against any actual expenses for attorneys fees and disbursements
  reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee.

   

   

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

  19. SUBROGATION. In the event of payment under this Agreement, the
  Company shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the
  rights of recovery of the Indemnitee, who shall execute all documents
  required and shall do all acts that may be necessary to secure such
  rights and to enable the Company effectively to bring suit to enforce
  such rights.

  20. EFFECTIVE DATE. The provisions of this Agreement shall cover claims
  or Proceedings whether now pending or hereafter commenced and shall be
  retroactive to cover acts or omissions or alleged acts or omissions which
  heretofore have taken place. The Company shall be liable under this
  Agreement, pursuant to Sections 4 and 5 hereof, for all acts of the
  Indemnitee while serving as a director and/or officer, notwithstanding
  the termination of the Indemnitees service, if such act was performed or
  omitted to be performed during the term of the Indemnitees service to
  the Company.

  21. GROSS-UP FOR TAXES. In the event any payment of indemnity to the
  Indemnitee under this Agreement shall be deemed to be income for federal,
  state or local income, excise or other tax purposes, then the Company
  shall pay to the Indemnitee, in addition to any amount for
  indemnification provided for herein, an amount equal to the amount of
  taxes for which the Indemnitee shall become liable (with offset for any
  deductions which the Indemnitee may have that are related to the
  indemnification amount but without offset for any other deductions which
  the Indemnitee may have that are not related to the indemnification
  amount), promptly upon receipt from the Indemnitee of a request for
  reimbursement of such taxes together with a copy of the Indemnitees tax
  return, which shall be maintained in strictest confidence by the Company.
  Any such tax gross-up payment shall be paid to the Indemnitee within 60
  days following receipt by the Company of the Indemnitees request and tax
  return, which shall be received by the Company no later than the end of
  the calendar year next following the calendar year in which the
  Indemnitee remits the related taxes; provided, however, that in the event
  the Indemnitee is audited by the Internal Revenue Service, the deadline
  for receipt by the Company of the Indemnitees request and tax return
  shall be extended to the end of three calendar years (plus the time
  length of any audit extensions requested by the Internal Revenue Service)
  next following the calendar year in which the Indemnitee remits the
  related taxes.

  22. DURATION OF AGREEMENT. This Agreement shall continue until and
  terminate upon the later of: (a) ten years after the Indemnitee has
  ceased to occupy any of the positions or have any relationships described
  in Sections 4 and 5 of this Agreement; (b) the final termination of all
  Proceedings to which the Indemnitee may be subject by reason of the fact
  that he/she is or was a director, officer, employee, agent or fiduciary
  of the Company or any of the Companys direct or indirect wholly-owned
  subsidiaries, or is or was serving at the request of the Company or any
  of the Companys direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries as a
  director, officer, employee, agent or fiduciary of any other entity,
  including, but not limited to, another corporation, partnership, limited
  liability company, employee benefit plan, joint venture, trust or other
  enterprise, or by reason of any act or omission by the Indemnitee in any
  such capacity; or (c) the expiration of all statutes of limitation
  applicable to possible Proceedings to which the Indemnitee may be subject
  arising out of the Indemnitees positions or relationships described in
  Sections 4 and 5 of this Agreement. The indemnification provided under
  this Agreement shall continue as to the Indemnitee even though he/she may
  have ceased to be a director or officer of the Company or any of the
  Companys direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries. This Agreement
  shall be binding upon the Company and its successors and assigns,
  including, without limitation, any corporation or other entity which may
  have acquired all or substantially all of the Companys assets or
  business or into which the Company may be consolidated or merged, and
  shall inure to the benefit of the Indemnitee and his/her spouse,
  successors, assigns, heirs, devisees, executors, administrators or other
  legal representations. The Company shall require any successor or
  assignee (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation
  or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets
  of the Company, by written agreement in form and substance reasonably
  satisfactory to the Company, expressly to assume and agree to perform
  this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company
  would be required to perform if no such succession or assignment had
  taken place.

   

   

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

  23. DISCLOSURE OF PAYMENTS. Except as required by any federal securities
  laws or other federal or state law, neither party hereto shall disclose
  any payments under this Agreement unless prior approval of the other
  party is obtained.

  24. CONTRIBUTION. To the fullest extent permissible under applicable law,
  if the indemnification provided for in this Agreement is unavailable to
  the Indemnitee for any reason whatsoever, the Company, in lieu of
  indemnifying the Indemnitee, shall contribute to the amount incurred by
  the Indemnitee, whether for judgments, fines, penalties, excise taxes,
  amounts paid or to be paid in settlement, and/or for Expenses, in
  connection with any claim relating a Proceeding under this Agreement, in
  such proportion as is deemed fair and reasonable in light of all of the
  circumstances of such Proceeding in order to reflect (i) the relative
  benefits received by the Company and the Indemnitee as a result of the
  event(s) and/or transaction(s) giving rise to such Proceeding; and/or
  (ii) the relative fault of the Company (and its directors, officers,
  employees, and agents) and the Indemnitee in connection with such
  event(s) and/or transaction(s). If such contribution constitutes deferred
  compensation subject to Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of
  1986, as amended, and the Treasury Regulations and other guidance
  thereunder (Section 409A), as determined by the Company, such
  contribution shall be paid to the Indemnitee (or the Indemnitees estate
  in the event of death) upon the earlier of (a) the Indemnitees
  separation from service (as defined by the Company in accordance with
  Section 409A); (b) the Indemnitees death; (c) the Indemnitees becoming
  disabled (as defined in Section 409A); (d) the occurrence of an
  unforeseeable emergency (as defined in Section 409A); or (e) a change
  in the ownership or effective control of the Company or in the ownership
  of a substantial portion of the assets of the Company (as defined in
  Section 409A).

  25. IRC SECTION 409A. This Agreement is intended to comply with Section
  409A (as defined in Section 23 of this Agreement) and any ambiguous
  provisions will be construed in a manner that is compliant with the
  application of Section 409A. If (a) the Indemnitee is a specified
  employee (as such term is defined by the Company in accordance with
  Section 409A) and (b) any payment payable upon separation from service
  (as such term is defined by the Company in accordance with Section 409A)
  under this Agreement is subject to Section 409A and is required to be
  delayed under Section 409A because the Indemnitee is a specified
  employee, that payment shall be payable on the earlier of (i) the first
  business day that is six months after the Indemnitees separation from
  service; (ii) the date of the Indemnitees death; or (iii) the date that
  otherwise complies with the requirements of Section 409A. This Section 25
  shall be applied by accumulating all payments that otherwise would have
  been paid within six months of the Indemnitees separation from service
  and paying such accumulated amounts on the earliest business day which
  complies with the requirements of Section 409A. For purposes of Section
  409A, each payment or amount due under this Agreement shall be considered
  a separate payment, and the Indemnitees entitlement to a series of
  payments under this Agreement is to be treated as an entitlement to a
  series of separate payments.

  26. SEVERABILITY. If any provision or provisions of this Agreement shall
  be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever, (a)
  the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of
  this Agreement (including, but not limited to, all portions of any
  Sections of this Agreement containing any such provision held to be
  invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall not in any way be affected or
  impaired thereby and (b) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions
  of this Agreement (including, but not limited to, all portions of any
  paragraph of this Agreement containing any such provision held to be
  invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that are not themselves invalid,
  illegal or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to the
  intent manifested by the provision held invalid, illegal or
  unenforceable.

   

   

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

  27. COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed by one or more
  counterparts, each of which shall for all purposes be deemed to be an
  original but all of which together shall constitute one and the same
  agreement. Only one such counterpart signed by the party against whom
  enforceability is sought shall be required to be produced to evidence the
  existence of this Agreement.

  28. CAPTIONS. The captions and headings used in this Agreement are
  inserted for convenience only and shall not be deemed to constitute part
  of this Agreement or to affect the construction thereof.

  29. ENTIRE AGREEMENT, MODIFICATION AND WAIVER. This Agreement, along with
  any employment agreement addressing the subject matter hereof and the
  Certificate and the Bylaws, interpreted as described in Section 17
  hereof, constitutes the entire agreement and understanding of the parties
  hereto regarding the subject matter hereof, and no supplement,
  modification or amendment of this Agreement shall be binding unless
  executed in writing by all parties hereto. No waiver of any of the
  provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall constitute a waiver
  of any other provisions hereof (whether or not similar) nor shall such
  waiver constitute a continuing waiver. No supplement, modification or
  amendment to this Agreement shall limit or restrict any right of the
  Indemnitee under this Agreement in respect of any act or omission of the
  Indemnitee prior to the effective date of such supplement, modification
  or amendment unless expressly provided therein.

  30. NOTICES. All notices, requests, demands or other communications
  hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given
  if (a) delivered by hand with receipt acknowledged by the party to whom
  said notice or other communication shall have been directed, (b) mailed
  by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested with postage
  prepaid, on the date shown on the return receipt or (c) delivered by

  EXHIBIT A

  [DATE]

  The Board of Directors of Oasis Petroleum Inc.
  1001 Fannin Street
  Houston, TX 77002

  Ladies and Gentlemen:

  Pursuant to Section 11 (Advancement of Expenses) of that certain
  Indemnification Agreement, dated _____, 2010, by and among Oasis
  Petroleum Inc., a Delaware corporation (the Company) and me (the
  Indemnification Agreement), I request that the Company pay in advance
  the reasonable expenses incurred by me in the defense of a Proceeding (as
  such term is defined in the Indemnification Agreement). I also request
  that the Company pay in advance the reasonable Expenses incurred by me in
  the defense of any other Proceeding, as such terms are defined in the
  Indemnification Agreement, arising from substantially the same matters
  that are in the original Proceeding in which I am named as a defendant by
  reason of the fact that I am or was an officer or member of the Board of
  Directors of the Company or its affiliates.

  In relation to the request made above, I believe, in good faith, that I
  have met the standard of conduct necessary for indemnification under the
  Indemnification Agreement, and I hereby undertake to repay to the
  Company, immediately and upon demand, any expenses (including attorneys
  fees) paid by it to me or on my behalf in advance of the final
  disposition of the above-described Proceedings, if it shall ultimately be
  determined that I am not entitled to be indemnified by the Company
  pursuant to the Indemnification Agreement or otherwise.
    	  	  	  	 
   
    	Sincerely, 	  	 
   
    	  	  	 
   
    	Printed Name:
