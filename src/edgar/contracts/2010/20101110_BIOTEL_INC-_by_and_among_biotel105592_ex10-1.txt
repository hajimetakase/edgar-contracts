W I T N E S S E T H :

          WHEREAS, the parties previously entered into a Merger Agreement, 
dated as of April 1, 2009 (the Prior Agreement).

          WHEREAS, the merger transaction contemplated by the Prior 
Agreement has not been consummated, and the parties have been engaged in 
litigation with respect thereto.

          WHEREAS, the parties have entered into a Settlement Agreement, of 
even date herewith (the Settlement Agreement), pursuant to which the 
parties have agreed, among other things, (i) to terminate the Prior 
Agreement, (ii) to settle the litigation with respect thereto and (iii) to 
enter into this Agreement, in each case in accordance with the terms and 
conditions set forth in the Settlement Agreement.

          WHEREAS the parties intend that Merger Sub be merged with and 
into the Company (the Merger), with the Company surviving the Merger as a 
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.

          WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has unanimously 
(i) determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its 
shareholders, and declared it advisable to enter into this Agreement, (ii) 
approved the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, the 
Plan of Merger attached hereto as Exhibit A (the Plan) and the 
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including 
the Merger, and (iii) resolved to recommend to the shareholders of the

representations, warranties, covenants and

- 1 -

------------------------------------------------------------------------

agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby, 
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

THE MERGER

          Section 1.1     The Merger. On the Closing Date (as hereinafter 
defined), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company on the terms 
and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and the Plan and 
in accordance with the Minnesota Business Corporation Act (the MBCA).

          Section 1.2     Closing. The closing of the Merger (the Closing
) shall take place at the Philadelphia office of Morgan, Lewis & Bockius 
LLP at 10:00 a.m., local time, on a date to be specified by the parties 
(the Closing Date) which shall be no later than the second business day 
after the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by applicable Law 
(as hereinafter defined)) of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other 
than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the 
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions), or 
at such other place, date and time as the Company and Parent may agree in 
writing.

          Section 1.3     Effective Date. The effective date of the Merger 
(the Effective Date) shall be the Closing Date or such later date as may 
be agreed by the Company and Merger Sub in writing and specified in the 
Articles of Merger in accordance with the MBCA.

          Section 1.4     Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have the 
effects set forth in this Agreement, the Plan and the applicable provisions 
of the MBCA. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject 
thereto, from and after the Effective Date, all property, rights, 
privileges, immunities, powers, franchises, licenses and authority of the 
Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all 
debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions and duties of each of the 
Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities, obligations, 
restrictions and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

ARTICLE II

CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

          Section 2.1     Effect on Capital Stock. As set forth in the 
Plan, at the Effective Date, by virtue of the Merger and without any action 
on the part of the Company, Merger Sub or the holders of any securities of 
the Company or Merger Sub:

                    (a)         Conversion of Company Common Stock. At the 
Effective Date, each share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of 
the Company (such shares, collectively, Company Common Stock, and each, a 
Share) outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Date other than 
Dissenting Shares (as hereinafter defined), shall be converted 
automatically into, and shall thereafter represent the right to receive a 
per Share amount equal to:

 

 

 

 



$11,000,000, plus or minus (as the case may be)

- 2 -

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

 

 

 



the amount by which the Companys consolidated working capital (current 
assets (excluding deferred tax assets) minus current liabilities (excluding 
deferred tax liabilities), determined in accordance with GAAP) immediately 
prior to the Closing is greater than, or less than, $3,600,000 (only as 
agreed by the parties at the Closing), minus

 

 

 

 



the aggregate Option Consideration, divided by

 

 

 

 



the number of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior 
to the Closing

(the Merger Consideration). All outstanding Shares that have been 
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in 
this Section 2.1(a) shall be automatically cancelled and shall cease to 
exist, and the holders of certificates which immediately prior to the 
Effective Date represented such Shares shall cease to have any rights with 
respect to such Shares other than the right to receive the Merger 
Consideration.

                    (b)         Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock. Each 
share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and 
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Date shall be converted into 
and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common 
stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation with the same 
rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall 
constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving 
Corporation. From and after the Effective Date, all certificates 
representing the common stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed for all 
purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving 
Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with the 
immediately preceding sentence.

                    (c)         Dissenters Rights. As set forth in the 
Plan, and notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, 
if required by the MBCA (but only to the extent required thereby), Shares 
that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Date and 
that are held by holders of such Shares who have not voted in favor of the 
approval of the Plan or consented thereto in writing and who have properly 
exercised appraisal rights with respect thereto in accordance with, and who 
have complied with, Section 302A.473 of the MBCA (the Dissenting Shares) 
will not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, 
and holders of such Dissenting Shares will be entitled to receive payment 
of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the 
provisions of such Section 302A.473 unless and until any such holder fails 
to perfect or effectively waives, withdraws or loses his, her or its rights 
to appraisal and payment under the MBCA. If, after the Effective Date, any 
such holder fails to perfect or effectively waives, withdraws or loses such 
right, such Dissenting Shares will thereupon be treated as if they had been 
converted into and have become exchangeable for, at the Effective Date, the 
right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, 
and the Surviving Corporation shall remain liable for payment of the Merger 
Consideration for such Shares. At the Effective Date, any holder of 
Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect to the 
Company, except the rights provided in Section 302A.473 of the MBCA and as 
provided in the previous sentence. The Company will give Parent (i) notice 
of any demands received by the Company for appraisals of Shares and (ii) 
the

- 3 -

------------------------------------------------------------------------

opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings 
with respect to such notices and demands. The Company shall not, except 
with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to 
any demands for appraisal or settle any such demands.

                    (d)         Adjustments. If at any time during the 
period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Date, any 
change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company shall 
occur as a result of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split 
(including a reverse stock split) or combination, exchange or readjustment 
of shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution is declared with a 
record date during such period, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably 
adjusted to reflect such change.

          Section 2.2     Exchange of Certificates.

                    (a)         Paying Agent. At or prior to the Effective 
Date, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited (including by 
requesting the Company to deposit unrestricted cash at Closing 
substantially as contemplated by Parents financing plan previously 
provided to the Company, which the Company hereby agrees to do to the 
extent legally permitted), with a U.S. bank or trust company that shall be 
appointed by Parent to act as a paying agent hereunder (the Paying Agent
), in trust for the benefit of holders of the Shares cash in U.S. dollars 
sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration in exchange for all of 
the outstanding Shares immediately prior to the Effective Date, payable 
upon due surrender of the certificates that immediately prior to the 
Effective Date represented Shares (Certificates) (or effective affidavits 
of loss in lieu thereof), pursuant to the provisions of this Article II 
(such cash referred to herein being hereinafter referred to as the 
Exchange Fund).

                    (b)         Payment Procedures.

 

 

 

                         (i)         As soon as reasonably practicable 
after the Effective Date, Parent shall instruct the Paying Agent to mail to 
each holder of record of Shares whose Shares were converted into the Merger 
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1, (A) a letter of transmittal (which 
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title 
to Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of Certificates (or 
effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent and shall 
be in such form and have such other customary provisions as Parent and the 
Company may mutually agree), and (B) instructions for effecting the 
surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) 
in exchange for the Merger Consideration.

 

 

 

                         (ii)         Upon surrender of Certificates (or 
effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent together 
with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in 
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may 
reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificates 
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a check in an amount 
equal to the product of (x) the number of Shares represented by such 
holders properly surrendered Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss 
in lieu thereof) multiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration. No interest 
will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of 
Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that

- 4 -

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

 

 

is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a check for any 
cash to be paid upon due surrender of the Certificate may be paid to such a 
transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such Shares is 
presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to 
evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock 
transfer Taxes (as hereinafter defined) have been paid or are not 
applicable.

                    (c)         Closing of Transfer Books. At the Effective 
Date, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there 
shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books 
of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding 
immediately prior to the Effective Date. If, after the Effective Date, 
Certificates are presented or delivered to the Surviving Corporation or 
Parent for transfer, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for a check in 
the proper amount pursuant to this Article II.

                    (d)         Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion 
of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof) 
that remains undistributed to the former holders of Shares one year after 
the Effective Date shall be delivered to the Parent upon demand, and any 
former holders of Shares who have not surrendered their Shares in 
accordance with this Section 2.2 shall thereafter look only to the Parent 
for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration, without any 
interest thereon, upon due surrender of their Shares.

                    (e)         No Liability. Notwithstanding anything 
herein to the contrary, none of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the 
Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or any other person shall be liable 
to any former holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a 
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or 
similar Law.

                    (f)         Investment of Exchange Fund. The Paying 
Agent shall invest all cash included in the Exchange Fund as reasonably 
directed by Parent. Any interest and other income resulting from such 
investments shall be paid to the Parent upon demand.

                    (g)         Withholding Rights. Parent, the Surviving 
Corporation or the Paying Agent, as appropriate, shall be entitled to 
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to 
this Agreement (including any payments made in respect of the Dissenting 
Shares) to any holder of Certificates such amounts as may be required to be 
deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the 
Internal Revenue Service Code, as amended (the Code) or under any 
provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts 
are so withheld, (i) such withheld amounts shall be treated for all 
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the 
Certificates in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made 
and (ii) Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as 
appropriate, shall provide to the holders of such Certificates written

ARTICLE III

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

          Except as disclosed in the Company SEC Documents (as hereinafter 
defined) filed at least ten (10) business days prior to the date hereof, to 
the extent the relevance of the disclosure is readily apparent and 
excluding any disclosures included in any such Company SEC Document that 
are predictive or cautionary in nature, or in the disclosure schedule 
delivered by the Company to Parent immediately prior to the execution of 
this Agreement (the Company Disclosure Schedule), the Company represents 
and warrants, on behalf of itself and each of its Subsidiaries, to Parent 
and Merger Sub as follows:

          Section 3.1     Qualification, Organization, Subsidiaries, etc.

                    (a)         Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is 
a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under 
the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization and has all 
requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease and 
operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as presently 
conducted and is qualified to do business and is in good standing as a 
foreign corporation in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or 
operation of its assets or properties or conduct of its business requires 
such qualification, all of which are listed in Section 3.1(a) of the 
Company Disclosure Schedule, except where the failure to be so organized, 
validly existing, qualified or in good standing, or to have such power or 
authority, would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company 
Material Adverse Effect. As used in this Agreement, any reference to any 
facts, circumstances, events or changes having a Company Material Adverse 
Effect means such facts, circumstances, events or changes that are or are 
reasonably likely to be materially adverse to (A) the business, financial 
condition, assets, liabilities or continuing operations of the Company and 
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole or (B) the Companys ability to perform 
its obligations under this Agreement or consummate the Merger prior to the 
End Date (regardless of whether or not such adverse effect or change can be 
or has been cured at any time or whether the Parent has knowledge of such 
effect or change on the date hereof), but that are not a result of the 
announcement or consummation of the transactions contemplated by the 
Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, neither the loss of business, 
business prospects or suppliers of the Company as a result of the 
announcement or consummation of the transactions contemplated by the 
Agreement, nor the Companys failure to meet internal or published 
projections, forecasts or

- 6 -

------------------------------------------------------------------------

revenue or earnings predictions for any period shall in and of itself 
constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect, but the underlying causes of 
such failure shall, to the extent applicable, be considered in determining 
whether there is a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has 
provided to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement a true and complete 
copy of (i) the Companys amended and restated articles of incorporation 
and by-laws, each as amended through the date hereof and (ii) the minutes 
(or, in the case of draft minutes, the most recent drafts thereof) of all 
meetings of the Companys stockholders, the Company Board and each 
committee of the Company Board of Directors held since January 1, 2004 
through the date hereof (except, in each case, minutes related to the 
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or other alternative strategic 
transactions considered).

                    (b)         Section 3.1(b) of the Company Disclosure 
Schedule sets forth a true and complete list of all the Subsidiaries of the 
Company (identifying its jurisdiction of incorporation, each jurisdiction 
in which it is qualified or licensed to do business, and the number of 
shares owned and percentage ownership represented by such share ownership). 
The Company owns, directly or indirectly, all of the outstanding shares of 
the capital stock or other equity interest of each of the Companys 
Subsidiaries free and clear of any Lien. Neither the Company nor any of its 
Subsidiaries owns, directly or indirectly, any capital stock, equity or 
other ownership interest in any other person.

                    (c)         The copies of the organizational documents 
of each Subsidiary, in each case as amended to date and provided to 
Parents and Merger Subs counsel, are true and complete copies thereof, 
and no amendments thereto are pending. None of the Companys Subsidiaries 
is in default in the performance, observation or fulfillment of its 
obligations under its respective organizational documents. The Company has 
provided to Parent prior to the date hereof (i) complete and correct copies 
of by-laws or similar governing documents of each of its Subsidiaries and 
(ii) the minutes (or, in the case of draft minutes, the most recent drafts 
thereof) of all meetings of its Subsidiaries stockholders, boards of 
directors and each committee of such Boards of Directors held since 
inception through the date hereof (except, in each case, minutes related to 
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or other alternative 
strategic transactions considered).

                    (b)         As used herein, Environmental Law means 
any Law (including common law) relating to (x) the protection, preservation 
or restoration of the environment (including air, water vapor, surface 
water, groundwater, drinking water supply, surface land, subsurface land, 
plant and animal life or any other natural resource), or (y) the exposure 
to, or the use, storage, recycling, treatment, generation, transportation, 
processing, handling, labeling, production, release or disposal of, 
Hazardous Substances, in each case as in effect at the date hereof.

                    (c)         As used herein, Hazardous Substance means 
any chemicals, materials or substances which are now defined as or included 
in the definition of hazardous substances, hazardous wastes, hazardous 
materials, extremely hazardous wastes, restricted hazardous wastes,

                    (d)         All references in this Section 3.8 to the 
Company and its Subsidiaries shall include all predecessors and 
predecessors in business of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries, as 
applicable.

          Section 3.9     Employee Benefit Plans.

                    (a)         Section 3.9(a)(i) of the Company Disclosure 
Schedule lists all Company Benefit Plans. Company Benefit Plans means all 
benefit plans, programs, policies, agreements or other arrangements, 
including any employee welfare plan within the meaning of Section 3(1) of 
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA), 
any employee pension benefit plan within the meaning of Section 3(2) of 
ERISA (whether or not such plan is subject to ERISA), any employment,

salary continuation, health or life insurance or fringe benefit plan, 
program or agreement, in each case that are sponsored, maintained or 
contributed to by the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of its ERISA 
Affiliates (as hereinafter defined) for the benefit of current or former 
employees, directors or consultants of the Company, its Subsidiaries or any 
of its ERISA Affiliates or to which the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of 
its ERISA Affiliates has any obligation or liability (contingent or 
otherwise).

                    (b)         The Company has heretofore provided to 
Parent true and complete copies of each of the Company Benefit Plans and 
certain related documents, including, but not limited to, (i) each writing 
constituting a part of such Company Benefit Plan, including all amendments 
thereto; (ii) the three most recent Annual Reports (Form 5500 Series) or 
other annual report, as applicable, and accompanying schedules, if any; 
(iii) the most recent determination letter from the U.S. Internal Revenue 
Service (IRS) (if applicable) for such Company Benefit Plan; (iv) the 
most recent actuarial report, if any; (v) the most recent summary plan 
descriptions; and (vi) written summaries of all non-written Company Benefit 
Plans.

                    (c)         Each Company Benefit Plan has been 
maintained and administered in compliance in all material respects with its 
terms and with applicable Law, including ERISA and the Code, to the extent 
applicable thereto. Each of the Company Benefit Plans intended to be 
qualified within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code is so 
qualified, and there are no existing circumstances or any events that have 
occurred that could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the 
qualified status of any such plan. With respect to each Company Benefit 
Plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA, the present value of the accrued 
benefits under such Company Benefit Plan, based upon the actuarial 
assumptions used for funding purposes in the most recent actuarial report 
prepared for such Company Benefit Plans actuary with respect to such 
Company Benefit Plan, did not, as of its latest valuation date, materially 
exceed the then current value of the assets of such Company Benefit Plan 
allocable to such accrued benefits. No Company Benefit Plan provides a 
material amount of health benefit coverage (whether or not insured), with 
respect to current or former employees or directors of the Company, its 
Subsidiaries or any of its ERISA Affiliates beyond their retirement or 
other termination of service, other than coverage mandated by applicable 
Law and at the expense of the employee or the employees beneficiary. No 
liability under Title IV of ERISA has been incurred by the Company, its 
Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate of the Company that has not been 
satisfied in full (other than with respect to amounts not yet due), and no 
condition exists that presents a risk to the Company, its Subsidiaries or 
any ERISA Affiliate of the Company of incurring a liability thereunder. No 
Company Benefit Plan is a multiemployer pension plan (as such term is 
defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA) or a plan that has two or more 
contributing sponsors, at least two of whom are not under common control, 
within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA. All contributions or other 
amounts payable by the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of its ERISA 
Affiliates as of the date hereof with respect to each Company Benefit Plan 
in respect of current or prior plan years have been timely paid or accrued 
in accordance with GAAP and no material accumulated funding deficiencies 
exist with respect to any of the Company Benefit Plans subject to Title IV 
of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. Neither the Company nor its 
Subsidiaries or ERISA Affiliates has engaged in a transaction in connection 
with which the Company, its Subsidiaries or its ERISA Affiliates reasonably 
could be subject to either a civil penalty assessed pursuant to Section 409 
or 502(i) of ERISA or a Tax imposed pursuant to Section 4975 or 4976

------------------------------------------------------------------------

of the Code. There are no pending, threatened or anticipated claims (other 
than routine claims for benefits) by, on behalf of or against any of the 
Company Benefit Plans, or any trusts related thereto (including claims by 
any Governmental Entity), which could reasonably be expected to result in 
liability to the Company, its Subsidiaries and its ERISA Affiliates taken 
as a whole. ERISA Affiliate means, with respect to any entity, trade or 
business, any other entity, trade or business (whether or not incorporated) 
that is a member of a group described in Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of 
the Code or Section 4001(b)(1) of ERISA that includes the first entity, 
trade or business, or that is a member of the same controlled group as 
the first entity, trade or business pursuant to Section 4001(a)(14) of 
ERISA.

                    (d)         The consummation of the transactions 
contemplated by this Agreement will not, either alone or in combination 
with another event, (i) entitle any current or former employee, consultant 
or officer of the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of its ERISA Affiliates 
to severance pay, unemployment compensation or any other payment, except as 
expressly provided in this Agreement or as required by applicable Law, or 
(ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase the amount of 
compensation due any such employee, consultant or officer, except as 
expressly provided in this Agreement. No payments or benefits under a 
Company Benefit Plan or other agreement of the Company, its Subsidiaries or 
any ERISA Affiliate of the Company will be considered an excess parachute 
payment under Section 280G of the Code. No Company Benefit Plan triggers 
the imposition of penalty taxes under Section 409A of the Code. Since 
January 1, 2009, each Company Benefit Plan that is subject to Section 409A 
of the Code has complied with Section 409A of the Code and the final 
regulations issued thereunder. No payments or benefits under a Company 
Benefit Plan or other agreement of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or 
any of its ERISA Affiliates are, or are expected to be, subject to the 
disallowance of a deduction under Section 162(m) of the Code. Neither the 
Company, any of its Subsidiaries nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has 
declared or paid any bonus compensation in contemplation of the 
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

                    (e)         Neither the Company, any of its 
Subsidiaries, nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has made a plan or 
commitment, whether or not legally binding, to create any additional 
Company Benefit Plan or to modify or change any existing Company Benefit 
Plan. No statement, either written or oral, has been made by the Company, 
any of its Subsidiaries or any of its ERISA Affiliates to any person with 
regard to any Company Benefit Plan that was not in accordance with the 
terms of an existing Company Benefit Plan and that could have an material 
adverse economic consequence to the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any 
of its ERISA Affiliates. All Company Benefit Plans may be amended or 
terminated without penalty by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any 
of its ERISA Affiliates at any time on or after the Closing.

          Section 3.10    Absence of Certain Changes or Events.

                    (a)         Since June 30, 2008, except as otherwise 
contemplated or required by this Agreement or the Prior Agreement, the 
businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries have been conducted, in all 
material respects, in the ordinary course of business consistent with past 
practice, and there has not been any event, development or state of 
circumstances that has had, individually or in the aggregate, a Company 
Material Adverse Effect.

Effective Date without the prior written consent of Parent would violate 
such provision.

eminent domain proceeding or any damage, destruction or casualty loss 
affecting any assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries, whether or not 
covered by insurance, has occurred which would have, individually or in the 
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

                    (d)         Except as set forth in Section 3.10(d) of 
the Company Disclosure Schedule, since June 30, 2008, no termination of 
employment (whether voluntary or involuntary) of any officer or key 
employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries has occurred.

                    (e)         Since June 30, 2008, no material Tax 
election has been made with respect to the Company, there has been no 
material change in any of its methods of Tax accounting and no settlement 
of any claim for Taxes with respect to the Company has been made.

          Section 3.11    Investigations; Litigation. Except as set forth 
in Section 3.11 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, as of the date hereof, 
there is no action, suit, proceeding, arbitration or, to the knowledge of 
the Company, investigation pending or threatened (a) against the Company or 
any of its Subsidiaries at Law or in equity or before any Governmental 
Entity or (b) that seeks restraint, prohibition, damages or other 
extraordinary relief in connection with this Agreement or the consummation 
of the transactions contemplated hereby. There are no unsatisfied judgments 
or outstanding orders, injunctions, decrees, writs, stipulations or awards 
by any Governmental Entity against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

          Section 3.12    Proxy Statement; Other Information. The proxy 
statement (including the letter to shareholders, notice of meeting and form 
of proxy, the Proxy Statement) to be filed by the Company with the SEC in 
connection with seeking the approval of this Agreement and the Plan and 
related matters by the shareholders of the Company will not, at the time it 
is filed with the SEC, or at the time it is first mailed to the 
shareholders of the Company or at the time of the Company Meeting, contain 
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact 
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements 
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not 
misleading. The Company will cause the Proxy Statement to comply as to form 
in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act 
applicable thereto as of the date of such filing.

          Section 3.13    Regulatory Compliance.

or any of its Subsidiaries is authorized to use any third partys

Companys or its Subsidiaries business (excluding off-the-shelf computer 
programs), and (ii) by which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries 
licenses or otherwise authorizes a third party to use any Company 
Intellectual Property owned by Company or its Subsidiaries. With respect to 
all intellectual property licensed from third parties, the right to use 
such intellectual property is free and clear of all Liens, and subject only 
to the restrictions and limitations set forth in the applicable written 
license agreements.

                    (d)         There are no actions that must be taken 
within 120 days of the Closing, including payment of any registration, 
maintenance or renewal fees or the filing of any documents, applications or

renewing any Company Intellectual Property described in Section 3.16(b) of 
the Company Disclosure Schedule.

                    (e)         Except as set forth is Section 3.16(e) of 
the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company has not received any notice of 
any conflict with or violation or infringement of or any claims of conflict 
with, any rights of any other person with respect to the Company 
Intellectual Property owned by the Company, nor, to the knowledge of the 
Company, does any third party have any valid grounds for any bona fide 
claims against the use by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any 
Company Intellectual Property owned by the Company. All granted and issued 
patents, all registered trademarks, registered service marks and registered 
copyrights described in Section 3.16(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule

there has not been and there is not any unauthorized use, infringement or

Property owned by the Company.

                    (f)         The Company and its Subsidiaries have used 
commercially reasonable efforts to safeguard and maintain the rights of the 
Company in the Company Intellectual Property, and the secrecy and 
confidentiality of the material trade secrets and the source code of any 
proprietary software owned, used or licensed by the Company in the 
operation of the Company and its Subsidiaries. To the knowledge of the 
Company, there has not been, and there is not, any unauthorized disclosure 
or misappropriation of any such trade secrets. Without limiting the 
foregoing, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries has and enforces a 
policy requiring each employee and contractor to execute a proprietary 
information/nondisclosure agreement substantially in the form(s) provided 
to Parent and all employees and contractors of the Company and its 
Subsidiaries have executed such an agreement.

                    (g)         The Company and Subsidiaries have not 
entered into any contracts with any Governmental Entity pursuant to which 
any of the Company, Subsidiaries or any employees or consultants of the 
Company or Subsidiaries are required to assign any rights in the Company 
Intellectual Property in favor of the United States or foreign governments 
(or any of their respective agencies).

          Section 3.17    Opinion of Financial Advisor. The Company has 
received the opinion of Oak Ridge Financial Services Group, Inc., dated the

and subject to the limitations and assumptions set forth therein, the

Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of Company 
Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement is fair, from a financial point of 
view, to such holders.

          Section 3.18    Required Vote of the Company Shareholders. The 
affirmative vote of the holders of outstanding shares of Company Common 
Stock representing at least a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast 
thereupon by holders of Company Common Stock is the only vote of holders of 
securities of the Company which is required to approve this Agreement and 
the Plan (the Company Shareholder Approval). No fair price, 
moratorium, control share acquisition or other similar anti-takeover 
statute or regulation enacted under state or federal Laws in the United 
States applicable to the Company is applicable to the Merger or the other 
transactions contemplated hereby. The action of the Board of Directors of 
the Company in approving this Agreement is sufficient to render 
inapplicable to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby the 
restrictions on control share acquisitions and business combinations 
(as each such term is defined in the MBCA).

          Section 3.19    Material Contracts.

                    (a)         Except as set forth in Section 3.19 of the

Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by (i) any material contract (as such 
term is defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the Exchange Act) 
or (ii) any of the following: (A) contract that purports to limit, curtail 
or restrict the ability of the Company or any of its existing or future 
Subsidiaries or affiliates to compete in any geographic area or line of 
business or restrict the persons to whom the Company or any of its existing 
or future Subsidiaries or affiliates may sell products or deliver services, 
(B) loan or credit agreement, mortgage, indenture, note or other contract 
or instrument evidencing indebtedness for borrowed money by the Company or 
any of its Subsidiaries or any contract or instrument pursuant to which 
indebtedness for borrowed money may be incurred or is guaranteed by the 
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (C) mortgage, pledge, security 
agreement, deed of trust or other contract granting a Lien on any property 
or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (D) (x) customer or 
client contract, or (y) any supplier contract that is reasonably likely to 
involve annual purchases by the Company and its Subsidiaries in excess of 
$20,000 (in the aggregate) in any of fiscal years 2011, 2012 or 2013, (E) 
contract (other than customer, client or supply contracts) that involve 
consideration (whether or not measured in cash) of greater than $20,000, 
(F) contract that restricts or otherwise limits the payment of dividends or 
other distributions on equity securities, (G) to the extent material to the 
business or financial condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken 
as a whole, (1) product or intellectual property design or development 
contract, (2) license or royalty contract or (3) contract granting a right 
of first refusal or first negotiation or most favored nation status, (H) 
investment banker engagement or similar agreement pursuant to which any 
person would be entitled to payment in connection with the Merger, (I) 
contract which would prohibit or delay the consummation of any of the 
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (J) commitment or 
agreement to enter into any of the foregoing (all contracts of the type 
described in this Section 3.19(a) being referred to herein as Company 
Material Contracts). Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a 
party to, or otherwise bound by or subject to, any agreement, contract, 
commitment or understanding, oral or written, regarding the sale, license 
or other transfer of rights or interests in any of the products

listed in Section 3.19(a)(1) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. The 
Company has provided to Parent correct and complete copies of each Company 
Material Contract in existence as of the date hereof, together with any and 
all amendments and supplements thereto, side letters and similar 
documentation relating thereto.

                    (b)         Each Company Material Contract to which any 
of the Company or its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them is 
bound is in full force and effect and constitutes the valid and binding 
obligation of the Company or such Subsidiary, as the case may be, and, to 
the knowledge of the Company, constitutes the valid and binding obligation 
of the other parties thereto. To the knowledge of the Company, no other 
party to any Company Material Contract is in breach of or default under the 
terms of any Company Material Contract. Section 3.19(b)(i) of the Company 
Disclosure Schedule sets forth a correct and complete list, as of the date 
hereof, of each current customer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries 
that has provided notice of an intention (A) to terminate its contract(s)

announcement or consummation of the transactions contemplated by the 
Agreement.

          Section 3.20    Insurance. Section 3.20 of the Company Disclosure 
Schedule sets forth a correct and complete list of all insurance policies 
(including information on the premiums payable in connection therewith and 
the scope and amount of the coverage provided thereunder) maintained by the 
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the Policies). The Policies (i) have 
been issued by insurers which are reputable and (ii) are in full force and 
effect. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in material 
breach or default, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries have 
taken any action or failed to take any action which, with notice or the 
lapse of time, would constitute such a material breach or default, or 
permit termination or material modification, of any of the Policies. No 
notice of cancellation or termination has been received by the Company with 
respect to any of the Policies. The consummation of the Merger will not, in 
and of itself, cause the revocation, cancellation or termination of any 
Policy.

          Section 3.21    Title To and Sufficiency of Property; Liens; 
Leases.

                    (a)         Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries 
has good, valid and marketable title to, or, in the case of leased 
properties and assets, valid leasehold interests in, all of its real 
property and its tangible properties and assets, in each case subject to no 
Liens, except for: (i) Liens reflected in the consolidated balance sheet of 
the Company as of December 31, 2008; (ii) Liens consisting of zoning or 
planning restrictions, easements, Permits and other restrictions or

or matters that would be disclosed by an accurate survey of the real 
property, and (iii) Liens for current Taxes, assessments or governmental 
charges or levies on property not yet due or which are being contested in 
good faith. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is in compliance with 
the terms of all leases of tangible properties to which it is a party and 
under which it is in occupancy, and all such leases are in full force and 
effect and each of the Company and its Subsidiaries enjoys peaceful and 
undisturbed possession under all such leases.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

                    (b)         All tangible assets owned or used by the 
Company and its Subsidiaries in the operation of their respective 
businesses (including all assets held by the Company and its Subsidiaries 
under leases and licenses) are in good operating condition and repair for 
assets of like type and age, subject to ordinary wear and tear, and are 
adequate for the conduct of such businesses as currently conducted.

                    (c)         Section 3.21(c) of the Company Disclosure 
Schedule sets forth the address or other description of each parcel of real

collaterally assigned or granted any security interest in such Owned Real 
Property.

                    (d)         Each lease (a Real Property Lease) of 
real property used by the Company or its Subsidiaries in the conduct of 
their business as currently conducted is listed in Section 3.21(d) of the 
Company Disclosure Schedule (Leased Real Property).

 

 

 

                        (i)     Each Real Property Lease relating to a 
Leased Real Property has been duly authorized and executed by the Company 
or such Subsidiary, as applicable.

 

 

 

                        (ii)    Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is 
in default in any material respect under any Real Property Lease relating 
to a Leased Real Property, nor has any event occurred which, with notice or 
the passage of time, or both, would give rise to such a default in any 
material respect by the Company or such Subsidiary, as applicable.

 

 

 

                        (iii)   To the knowledge of the Company, no other 
party to any Real Property Lease relating to a Leased Real Property is in 
default in any material respect under any such lease.

 

 

 

                        (iv)   Neither the Company nor any of its 
Subsidiaries has assigned, transferred, conveyed, mortgaged, deeded in 
trust or encumbered any interest in any Real Property Lease relating to a 
Leased Real Property.

                    (e)         No assessment for public improvement, which 
is due and remaining unpaid, has been made against any Owned Real Property 
or Leased Real Property, and, to the Companys knowledge, there are no 
currently proposed or pending assessments for public improvements against 
the Owned Real Property or Leased Real Property to which the Company or any 
of its Subsidiaries will be responsible. Since January 1, 2004, there has 
been no condemnation or eminent domain proceeding filed, or to the 
knowledge of the Company, threatened, which has had, or would reasonably be 
expected to have, an adverse effect on a portion of, or the Company or any 
Subsidiarys use of a portion of, the Owned Real Property or Leased Real 
Property.

          Section 3.22     Finders or Brokers. Except for fees relating to 
the opinion described in Section 3.17, neither the Company nor any of its 
Subsidiaries has employed any investment banker, broker or finder in 
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement who might 
be entitled to any fee or any commission in connection with or upon 
consummation of the Merger.

ARTICLE IV

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB

          Except as disclosed in forms, documents and reports required to 
be filed or furnished prior to the date hereof by Parent with the SEC (such 
documents and reports, together with any reports filed by Parent with the 
SEC on a voluntary basis on Form 8-K, the Parent SEC Documents), to the 
extent the relevance of the disclosure is readily apparent and excluding 
any disclosures included in any such Parent SEC Document that are 
predictive or cautionary in nature, or in the disclosure schedule delivered 
by Parent to the Company immediately prior to the execution of this 
Agreement (the Parent Disclosure Schedule), Parent and Merger Sub jointly 
and severally represent and warrant to the Company as follows:

          Section 4.1     Qualification; Organization, Subsidiaries, etc. 
Each of Parent and Merger Sub is a legal entity duly organized, validly 
existing and in good standing under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction 
of organization and has all requisite corporate or similar power and 
authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry 
on its business as presently conducted and is qualified to do business and 
is in good standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction where the 
ownership, leasing or operation of its assets or properties or conduct of 
its business requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so 
organized, validly existing, qualified or in good standing, or to have such 
power or authority, would not, individually or in the aggregate, prevent or 
materially delay or materially impair the

- 26 -

------------------------------------------------------------------------

ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Merger and the other 
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (a Parent Material Adverse 
Effect). Parent has made available to the Company prior to the date of

incorporation and by-laws or other equivalent organizational documents of 
Parent and Merger Sub, each as amended through the date hereof.

          Section 4.2     Corporate Authority Relative to This Agreement;

                    (a)         Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all 
requisite corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement and to 
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Plan). The 
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the 
transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized by 
the Boards of Directors of Parent and Merger Sub and by Parent, as the sole 
shareholder of Merger Sub, and, except for the filing of the Articles of 
Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Minnesota, no other 
corporate proceedings on the part of Parent or Merger Sub are necessary to 
authorize the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. This 
Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by Parent and 
Merger Sub and, assuming this Agreement constitutes the valid and binding 
agreement of the Company, this Agreement constitutes the valid and binding 
agreement of Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against each of Parent and 
Merger Sub in accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and 
Equity Exception.

                    (b)         The execution, delivery and performance by 
Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger

similar Laws of any foreign jurisdiction, (iii) compliance with the

Disclosure Schedule (collectively, clauses (i) through (v), collectively, 
the Parent Approvals), and other than any other consent, approval, 
authorization, permit, action, filing or notification the failure of which 
to make or obtain would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a 
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

                    (c)         The execution, delivery and performance by 
Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement and the consummation by Parent and 
Merger Sub of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby do 
not and will not (i) contravene or conflict with the organizational or 
governing documents of Parent or Merger Sub, (ii) assuming compliance with 
the matters referenced in Section 4.2(b), contravene or conflict with or 
constitute a violation of any provision of any Law binding upon or 
applicable to Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective properties or 
assets, or (iii) result in any violation of, or default (with or without 
notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of 
termination, cancellation or acceleration of any material obligation or to 
the loss of a material benefit under any loan, guarantee of indebtedness or 
credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease, agreement, 
contract, instrument, permit, concession, franchise, right or license 
binding upon Parent or Merger Sub or result in the creation of any Lien 
(other than Parent Permitted Liens) upon any of the properties

------------------------------------------------------------------------

or assets of Parent or Merger Sub, other than, in the case of clauses (ii) 
and (iii), any such violation, conflict, default, termination, 
cancellation, acceleration, right, loss or Lien that would not have,

Parent Permitted Lien means any Lien (A) for Taxes or governmental 
assessments, charges or claims of payment not yet due or being contested in 
good faith, provided adequate accruals or reserves have been established in

issued and outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub is, and at the Effective 
Date will be, owned by Parent or a direct or indirect wholly owned 
Subsidiary of Parent. Merger Sub has outstanding no option, warrant, right,

party, as the case may be), Merger Sub (a) has not conducted any business 
prior to the date hereof and (b) has, and prior to the Effective Date will 
have, no assets, liabilities or obligations of any nature other than those

          Section 4.5     No Vote of Parent Stockholders. No vote of the 
stockholders of Parent or the holders of any other securities of Parent 
(equity or otherwise) is required by any applicable Law, the certificate of

Common Stock. There are no voting trusts or other agreements or 
understandings to which

the capital stock or other equity interest of the Company or any of its 
Subsidiaries.

agreements with respect to any acquisitions, mergers, consolidations or 
business combinations) which would reasonably be expected to result in, 
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

          Section 5.2     Investigation.

                    (a)         The Company shall afford to Parent and to 
its officers, employees, accountants, consultants, legal counsel, financial 
advisors and agents and other representatives (collectively, Parent 
Representatives) reasonable access, throughout the period prior to the 
earlier of the Effective Date and the Termination Date, to its and its 
Subsidiaries management, employees, properties, contracts, commitments, 
books and records and any report, schedule or other document filed or 
received by it pursuant to the requirements of applicable Laws. Such 
reasonable access shall include, without limitation, access to properties

                    (b)         Parent hereby agrees that all information 
provided to it or Parent Representatives in connection with this Agreement 
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall be

accordance with, the Mutual Nondisclosure Agreement, dated as of September 
24,

- 32 -

------------------------------------------------------------------------

2010, between the Company and Parent (the Nondisclosure Agreement), the 
terms of which are hereby specifically incorporated into this Agreement.

          Section 5.3     No Solicitation.

                    (a)         The Company shall and shall cause its 
Subsidiaries to, and shall use their best efforts to cause its and their 
respective officers, employees, accountants, consultants, legal counsel, 
financial advisor and agents and other representatives (collectively, 
Company Representatives) to, (x) immediately cease and cause to be 
terminated any discussions or negotiations with any person conducted 
heretofore with respect to an Alternative Proposal or potential Alternative 
Proposal and (y) immediately request the prompt return from all such 
persons, or the destruction by such persons, of all copies of confidential 
information previously provided to such persons by the Company, its 
Subsidiaries or their respective Company Representatives and shall deny 
access to any virtual data room containing any such information to any 
person (other than Parent and Parent Representatives). The Company agrees 
that neither it nor any Subsidiary of the Company shall, and that it shall 
use its best efforts to cause its and their respective Company 
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, 
cause or knowingly encourage directly or indirectly (including by way of 
furnishing information) any inquiry with respect to, or the making, 
submission or announcement of, any Alternative Proposal (as hereinafter 
defined), (ii) participate in any negotiations regarding an Alternative 
Proposal with, or furnish any information regarding the Company or any 
Alternative Proposal to, any person that has made or, to the Companys 
knowledge, is considering making an Alternative Proposal, or (iii) engage 
in discussions regarding an Alternative Proposal with any person that has 
made or, to the Companys knowledge, is considering making an Alternative 
Proposal, except to notify such person as to the existence of the 
provisions of this Section 5.3. Without limiting the foregoing, it is 
understood that any action taken by Company Representatives that would be a 
violation of the restrictions set forth in Section 5.3 if taken by the 
Company shall be deemed to be a breach of Section 5.3 by the Company.

                    (b)         Notwithstanding the limitations set forth 
in this Section 5.3, prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval 
(but in no event after obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval), if (A) 
the Company receives a bona fide written Alternative Proposal made after 
the date hereof which the Board of Directors of the Company determines in 
good faith, by resolution duly adopted (i) constitutes a Superior Proposal 
or (ii) is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal, and (B) the 
Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after 
consultation with its outside counsel, that the failure to do so would be 
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties 
under applicable Law, the Company may take the following actions (only 
after providing Parent concurrent notice of its intention to take such 
actions and after receiving from the third party an executed agreement 
containing confidentiality provisions that are no less favorable to the 
Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement): (x) furnish 
information to the person (including such persons representatives) making 
such Alternative Proposal, and (y) engage in discussions or negotiations 
with such person (including such persons representatives) with respect to 
the Alternative Proposal. The Company shall provide Parent with a correct 
and complete copy of any confidentiality agreement entered into pursuant to 
this paragraph within 24 hours after the execution thereof and shall 
provide to Parent a correct and complete copy of any information

- 33 -

------------------------------------------------------------------------

provided or made available to any person pursuant to this paragraph at the 
same time such information is provided or made available to such other 
person.

                    (c)         The Company will promptly notify Parent 
(within 24 hours) of the receipt of any Alternative Proposal and shall, in 
any such notice to Parent, indicate the identity of the person making such 
proposal and the material terms and conditions of such proposal, shall 
include with such notice a copy of such proposal, and thereafter shall 
promptly keep Parent reasonably informed of all material developments 
affecting the status and terms of such proposal (and the Company shall 
provide Parent promptly (within 24 hours) with copies of any additional 
written materials received that relate to such proposal).

                    (d)         Except as expressly permitted by this 
Section 5.3(d), neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any 
committee thereof shall (i)(A) withdraw or modify, or propose publicly to 
withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the approval of this 
Agreement and the Plan or the recommendation by such Board of Directors or 
committee that shareholders of the Company approve this Agreement and the 
Plan, (B) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or 
recommend, any Alternative Proposal or (C) in the event of a tender offer 
or exchange offer for any outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, fail 
to recommend against acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer by 
the Companys shareholders within fifteen (15) business days of the 
commencement thereof (for the avoidance of doubt, the taking of no position 
or a neutral position by the Board of Directors of the Company in respect 
of the acceptance of any tender offer or exchange offer by its shareholders 
shall constitute a failure to recommend against any such offer) (any action 
described in this clause (i) being referred to as a Change of 
Recommendation) or (ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to 
approve or recommend, or cause or authorize the Company or any of its 
Subsidiaries to enter into, any letter of intent, agreement in principle, 
memorandum of understanding, merger, acquisition, purchase or joint venture 
agreement or other agreement related to any Alternative Proposal (other 
than a confidentiality agreement in accordance with Section 5.3(b)) (each a 
Company Acquisition Agreement). Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any 
time prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval and subject to 
this Section 5.3(d), the Board of Directors of the Company may (1) make a 
Change of Recommendation if the Board of Directors of the Company 
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel, that 
the failure to do so would be reasonably like to be inconsistent with the 
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law or (2) in response to a 
Superior Proposal, cause the Company to terminate this Agreement and 
concurrently with such termination enter into a Company Acquisition 
Agreement, subject to satisfaction of its obligations under Section 7.2; 
provided, however, that the Board of Directors of the Company shall not be 
entitled to exercise its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to 
Section 7.1(f) until immediately after the third business day following 
Parents receipt of written notice (a Superior Proposal Termination Notice
) from the Company advising Parent that the Board of Directors of the 
Company intends to take such action and specifying the reasons therefor, 
including a description of the material terms of the Superior Proposal that 
is the basis for the proposed action of the Board of Directors of the 
Company (it being understood and agreed that, in the event of an amendment 
to the financial terms or other material terms of such Superior Proposal, 
the Board of Directors of the Company shall not be entitled to exercise 
such right based on such Superior Proposal, as so amended, until 
immediately after the third business day following Parents receipt of a 
Superior Proposal Termination Notice with respect to such

- 34 -

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Superior Proposal as so amended). In connection with any Superior Proposal 
Termination Notice, the Company agrees that, until immediately after the 
third business day following Parents receipt of such Superior Proposal 
Termination Notice, the Company and its Representatives shall (if Parent so 
requests) negotiate in good faith with Parent and its Representatives 
regarding any revisions to the terms of the transactions contemplated by 
this Agreement proposed by Parent. In determining whether to make a Change 
of Recommendation or terminate this Agreement in response to a Superior 
Proposal, the Board of Directors of the Company shall take into account any 
amendment to this Agreement entered into, or to which Parent irrevocably 
covenants to enter into and for which all internal approvals of Parent have 
been obtained, since receipt of the applicable Superior Proposal 
Termination Notice, and shall not make a Change of Recommendation or 
terminate this Agreement unless, prior to the effectiveness of such Change 
of Recommendation or termination, the Board of Directors of the Company 
shall have determined in good faith, after considering the results of any 
such negotiations and any revised proposals made by Parent, that the 
Superior Proposal giving rise to such notice continues to be a Superior 
Proposal.

                    (e)         Nothing contained in this Agreement shall 
prohibit the Company or its Board of Directors from issuing a stop, look 
and listen statement pending disclosure of its position, in accordance 
with the provisions of Section 5.3(d), contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act.

                    (f)         As used in this Agreement, Alternative 
Proposal shall mean any bona fide inquiry, proposal or offer made by any 
person or group (as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) prior 
to the receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval (other than a proposal 
or offer by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries) regarding (i) a merger, 
reorganization, share exchange, consolidation, business combination, 
recapitalization, dissolution, liquidation or similar transaction involving 
the Company, (ii) the acquisition by any person or group of fifteen percent 
(15%) or more of the fair market value of the assets of the Company and its 
Subsidiaries or (iii) the acquisition by any person or group of fifteen 
percent (15%) or more of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock.

                    (g)         As used in this Agreement Superior 
Proposal shall mean a bona fide, written offer made by a third party to 
acquire, directly or indirectly, more than 66 2/3% of the equity securities 
of the Company or of the fair market value of the assets of the Company and 
its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, which the Board of Directors of 
the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys 
financial and legal advisors, and considering such factors as the Companys 
Board of Directors considers to be appropriate (including the timing and 
likelihood of consummation of such proposal), are more favorable to the 
Company and its shareholders from a financial point of view than the 
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

          Section 5.4     Proxy Statement; Company Meeting.

                    (a)         As soon as practicable following the date 
of this Agreement, and in no case more than thirty (30) days following the 
date of this Agreement, the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC the 
Proxy Statement, which shall, include the Recommendation. The

- 35 -

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Company shall use its best efforts to (i) respond to any comments on the 
Proxy Statement or requests for additional information from the SEC as soon 
as practicable after receipt of any such comments or requests, (ii) obtain 
clearance from the SEC to mail the Proxy Statement as soon as practicable, 
and (iii) cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the shareholders of the 
Company promptly upon such clearance. The Company shall promptly (A) notify 
Parent upon the receipt of any such comments or requests and (B) provide 
Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company and Company 
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC and its staff, on the other 
hand. Prior to responding to any such comments or requests or the filing or 
mailing of the Proxy Statement, the Company shall provide Parent with a 
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any drafts of the Proxy 
Statement and related correspondence and filings. If at any time prior to 
the Effective Date any event shall occur, or fact or information shall be 
discovered, that should be set forth in an amendment of or a supplement to 
the Proxy Statement, the Company shall, in accordance with the procedures 
set forth in this Section 5.4(a), prepare and file with the SEC such 
amendment or supplement as soon thereafter as is reasonably practicable and 
to the extent required by applicable Law, cause such amendment or 
supplement to be distributed to the shareholders of the Company. Parent and 
Merger Sub shall provide to the Company, in a timely manner, with such 
information as is required to be included in the Proxy Statement under the 
Exchange Act with respect to it or them and the rules promulgated 
thereunder and such other information as the Company may reasonably request 
for inclusion in the Proxy Statement.

                    (b)         The Company shall (i) take all action 
necessary in accordance with the MBCA and its articles of incorporation and 
by-laws to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its 
shareholders as promptly as reasonably practicable following the mailing of 
the Proxy Statement for the purposes of (A) obtaining the Company 
Shareholder Approval and (B) in the event such meeting is also the 
Companys annual meeting of shareholders, the election of directors and 
such other purposes as the Company may determine (the Company Meeting), 
and (ii) use all reasonable efforts to solicit from its shareholders 
proxies in favor of the approval of this Agreement and the Plan. Without 
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Companys obligations 
pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 5.4(b) shall not be affected 
by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to 
the Company of any Alternative Proposal.

          Section 5.5     Reasonable Best Efforts.

                    (a)         Subject to the terms and conditions set 
forth in this Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall use its 
reasonable best efforts (subject to, and in accordance with, applicable 
Law) to take promptly, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do 
promptly, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other 
parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under 
applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other 
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) the obtaining of 
all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, clearances, consents and 
approvals, including the Company Approvals and the Parent Approvals, from 
Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary registrations and 
filings and the taking of all steps as may be necessary to obtain an 
approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any 
Governmental Entity, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary consents, 
approvals or waivers from third parties, and (iii) the execution and

- 36 -

------------------------------------------------------------------------

delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the 
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that in no 
event shall any party hereto be required to pay prior to the Effective Date 
any fee, penalty or other consideration to any third party for any consent 
or approval required for the consummation of the transactions contemplated 
by this Agreement under any contract or agreement.

                    (b)         Without limiting the foregoing, the Company 
and Parent shall (i) use reasonable best efforts to cooperate with each 
other in (x) determining whether any filings are required to be made with, 
or consents, permits, authorizations, waivers, clearances or approvals are 
required to be obtained from, any third parties or other Governmental 
Entities in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement 
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and (y) timely 
making all such filings and timely seeking all such consents, permits, 
authorizations, clearances or approvals, (ii) use reasonable best efforts 
to take, or cause to be taken, all other actions and do, or cause to be 
done, all other things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and 
make effective the transactions contemplated hereby, including taking all 
such further action as may be necessary to resolve such objections, if any, 
as the United States Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of 
the United States Department of Justice, state antitrust enforcement 
authorities or competition authorities of any other nation or other 
jurisdiction or any other person may assert under Regulatory Law (as 
hereinafter defined) with respect to the Merger and the other transactions 
contemplated hereby, and (iii) subject to applicable legal limitations and 
the instructions of any Governmental Entity, keep each other apprised of 
the status of matters relating to the completion of the transactions 
contemplated thereby, including promptly furnishing the other with copies 
of notices or other communications received by the Company or Parent, as 
the case may be, or any of their respective Subsidiaries, from any third 
party and/or any Governmental Entity with respect to such transactions. The 
Company and Parent shall permit counsel for the other party reasonable 
opportunity to review in advance, and consider in good faith the views of 
the other party in connection with, any proposed written communication to 
any Governmental Entity. Each of the Company and Parent agrees not to 
participate in any substantive meeting or discussion, either in person or 
by telephone, with any Governmental Entity in connection with the proposed 
transactions unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to the 
extent not prohibited by such Governmental Entity, gives the other party 
the opportunity to attend and participate. Notwithstanding anything in this 
Section 5.5 to the contrary, in no event will Parent or Merger Sub be 
obligated to, and the Company and its Subsidiaries will not, propose or 
agree to accept any undertaking or condition, to enter into any consent 
decree or hold separate order, to make any divestiture, to accept any 
operational restriction or limitation, or to take any other action that 
would (i) involve assets or operations of Parent or any of its affiliates 
or (ii) reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse 
Effect; provided, that for solely the purposes of this Section 5.5(b), a 
Company Material Adverse Effect shall include, without limitation, the 
divestiture of businesses, product lines or assets that accounted for 15% 
or more of the Companys and its Subsidiaries consolidated fiscal year

                    (c)         In furtherance and not in limitation of the 
covenants of the parties contained in this Section 5.5, if any 
administrative or judicial action or proceeding, including any proceeding 
by a private party, is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) 
challenging any transaction contemplated by this Agreement as violative of 
any Regulatory Law, each of the Company and Parent shall cooperate in all 
respects with each other and shall use their respective reasonable best 
efforts to contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have 
vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or 
other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect

statute or regulation shall be or become applicable to the transactions 
contemplated hereby, each of the Company and Parent and the members of 
their respective Boards of Directors shall grant such approvals and take 
such actions as are reasonably necessary so that the transactions 
contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the 
terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the

communication received by such party from any Governmental Entity in 
connection with this Agreement or from any person alleging that the consent 
of such person is or may be required in connection with the Merger or the 
transactions contemplated hereby, if the subject matter of such 
communication or the failure of such party to obtain such consent could be 
material to the Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, (ii) any 
actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to such 
partys knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or 
otherwise affecting such party or any of its Subsidiaries which relate to 
the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby, and (iii) the discovery 
of any fact or circumstance that, or the occurrence or non-occurrence of 
any event the occurrence or non-occurrence of which, would cause the 
failure of any condition to consummation of the Merger; provided, however, 
that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.9 shall not (A) 
cure any breach of, or non-compliance with, any other provision of this 
Agreement or (B) limit the remedies available to the party receiving such 
notice.

                       (i)     effective as of the Effective Date, the 
vesting of each unvested Company Stock Option shall be accelerated so that 
all Company Stock Options shall be fully vested as of the Effective Date;

 

 

 

                       (ii)    effective as of the Effective Date, each 
Company Stock Option (whether vested or not) outstanding immediately prior

exercise price per share of such Company Stock Option, multiplied by (B) 
the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company 
Stock Option (such product referred to herein as Option Consideration); 
and

 

 

 

                       (iii)   effective as of the Effective Date, each

the Surviving Corporation or any other equity interest therein.

anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement may be 
terminated and abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Date, whether 
before or after any approval of the matters presented in connection with 
the Merger by the shareholders of the Company:

                    (a)         by the mutual written consent of the 
Company and Parent;

                    (b)         by either the Company or Parent if (i) the 
Effective Date shall not have occurred on or before March 31, 2011 (the 
End Date), and (ii) the party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant 
to this Section 7.1(b) shall not have breached in any material respect its

caused the failure to consummate the Merger on or before such date;

                    (c)         by either the Company or Parent if an 
injunction shall have been entered permanently restraining, enjoining or 
otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Merger and such injunction 
shall have become final and non-appealable, provided that the party seeking 
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(c) shall have used 
its reasonable efforts to remove such injunction;

                    (d)         by either the Company or Parent if the 
Company Meeting (including any adjournments or postponements thereof) shall 
have concluded and the Company Shareholder Approval contemplated by this 
Agreement shall not have been obtained or by Parent if the Company Meeting 
shall not have concluded prior to the close of business on the day prior to 
the End Date;

                    (e)         by the Company, if Parent shall have

however, that the Company shall have complied with the provisions of 
Section 5.3;

breached or failed to perform in any material respect any of its 
representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in 
this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) would result in a 
failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.1 or 6.3 and (ii) cannot be 
cured by the End Date, provided that Parent shall have given the Company 
written notice, delivered at least thirty (30) days prior to such

- 42 -

------------------------------------------------------------------------

termination, stating Parents intention to terminate this Agreement 
pursuant to this Section 7.1(g) and the basis for such termination;

                    (h)         by Parent, prior to the Company Shareholder 
Approval, if the Board of Directors of the Company has failed to make the 
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement or has made a Change of 
Recommendation; and

                    (i)         by Parent if holders of five percent (5%) 
or more of the Shares have exercised dissenters rights in accordance with 
Section 302A.471 et seq. of the MBCA.

          Section 7.2     Effect of Termination.

                    (a)         In the event that (i) this Agreement is 
terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(h), (ii) this Agreement is 
terminated after December 31, 2010 by the Company pursuant to Section 
7.1(f) or (iii) (A) an Alternative Proposal shall have been made to the 
Company or shall have been made directly to the shareholders of the Company 
generally or shall have otherwise become publicly known or any person shall 
have publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make 
an Alternative Proposal, (B) thereafter this Agreement is terminated (I) by 
Company pursuant to Section 7.1(b) or (II) by either Parent or the Company 
pursuant to Section 7.1(d) and (C) within 12 months after such termination, 
the Company enters into a definitive agreement to consummate, or 
consummates, the transactions contemplated by any Alternative Proposal 
(regardless of whether such Alternative Proposal is made before or after 
termination of this Agreement), then the Company shall pay Parent a fee 
equal to $330,000 (the Termination Fee) plus Expenses of up to $100,000, 
by wire transfer of same-day funds on the first business day following (x) 
in the case of a payment required by clause (i) or (ii) above, the date of 
termination of this Agreement and (y) in the case of a payment required by 
clause (iii) above, the date of the first to occur of the events referred 
to in clause (iii)(C) above. Expenses shall mean the cash amount 
necessary to reimburse Parent, Merger Sub and each of their respective 
affiliates for all out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred (whether or not 
billed) at any time (whether before or after the date of this Agreement) 
prior to the termination of this Agreement by any of them or on their 
behalf in connection with the Merger, this Agreement, their due diligence 
investigation of the Company and the transactions contemplated by this 
Agreement (including the fees and expenses of counsel, investment banking 
firms or financial advisors and their respective counsel and 
representatives).

                    (b)         The Company and Parent acknowledge and 
agree that the agreements contained in Section 7.2(a) are an integral part 
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these 
agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the 
Company fails promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to Section 7.2(a), 
and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit that results 
in a judgment against the Company for the Termination Fee and/or Expenses, 
the Company shall pay to Parent its costs and expenses (including 
attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with 
interest on the amount of the Termination Fee and/or Expenses, as the case 
may be, from the date such payment was required to be made until the date 
of payment at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A., in effect on the date such 
payment was required to be made.

- 43 -

------------------------------------------------------------------------

                    (c)         In the event of the termination of this 
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1, this Agreement shall become void and 
have no effect, without any liability or obligation on the part of Parent, 
Merger Sub or the Company under this Agreement, other than the provisions 
of Sections 5.2(b), 7.2, 8.2, 8.4, 8.5, 8.6 and 8.10, which provisions 
shall survive such termination; provided, however, that no such termination 
shall relieve any party hereto from any liability or damages resulting from 
the willful and material breach by a party of any of its representations, 
warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement.

ARTICLE VIII

or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or 
from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of 
notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of 
judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (c) to the fullest extent 
permitted by the applicable law, any claim that (i) the suit, action or 
proceeding in such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the

given, and such notice shall be deemed to have been delivered as of the

Agreement may notify any other party of any changes to the address or any

          Section 8.8     Assignment; Binding Effect. Neither this 
Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall

Agreement which is invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as 
to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or 
unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining 
terms and provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any 
provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, such 
provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable. Upon

parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner, to the end that the 
transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

Effective Date, any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived 
if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and signed, in the 
case of an amendment, by the Company, Parent and Merger Sub, or in the case 
of a waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective; 
provided, however, that after receipt of Company Shareholder Approval, if 
any such amendment or waiver shall by applicable Law require further 
approval of the shareholders of the Company, the effectiveness of such 
amendment or waiver shall be subject to the approval of the shareholders of 
the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the 
Company or Parent in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a 
waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude 
any other or further exercise of any other right hereunder.

OF

GARDEN MERGER SUB, INC.

INTO

          PLAN OF MERGER (hereinafter referred to as the Plan), dated 
__________ __, 20__, for the merger of Garden Merger Sub, Inc., a Minnesota 
corporation (the Merged Corporation), into Biotel Inc., a Minnesota 
corporation (the Surviving Corporation). (The Merged and Surviving 
Corporations may be collectively referred to as Constituent Corporations

RECITALS

          A.          The Constituent Corporations are corporations duly 
organized and existing under the laws of the State of Minnesota.

          B.          The Constituent Corporations are parties to a Merger 
Agreement, dated as of November 5, 2010, and the merger effected pursuant 
to this Plan of Merger is being consummated pursuant to such Merger 
Agreement.

          NOW, THEREFORE, the Constituent Corporations shall be merged into 
a single corporation, Biotel Inc. a Minnesota corporation, and one of the 
Constituent Corporations, which shall continue its corporate existence and 
be the corporation surviving the merger. The terms and conditions of this

Effective Date of the Merger

          The Effective Date shall be the close of business on __________

Minnesota corporation.

ARTICLE II
Governing Laws; Articles of
Incorporation; Authorized Shares

- 1 -

------------------------------------------------------------------------

          The Articles of Incorporation of the Merged Corporation shall be 
the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation as of the 
Effective Date of the Merger; provided, however, that ARTICLE 1 of the 
Merged Corporations Articles of Incorporation shall be amended to read as 
follows: The name of this corporation is Biotel Inc.

ARTICLE III
Bylaws; Registered Office

          The Bylaws of the Merged Corporation shall be the Bylaws of the 
Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Date of the Merger. The 
registered office of the Surviving Corporation after the Merger shall be at 
___________________________.

ARTICLE IV
Directors and Officers

          The directors of the Merged Corporation as of the Effective Date 
shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation and shall hold 
office until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, or 
their earlier death, resignation or removal. The officers of the Merged 
Corporation as of the Effective Date shall be the initial officers of the 
Surviving Corporation and shall hold office until their respective 
successors are duly elected and qualified, or their earlier death, 
resignation or removal. The directors and officers of the Surviving 
Corporation holding office on the Effective Date shall be deemed to have 
resigned effective as of the Effective Date.

ARTICLE V
Conversion of Shares in the Merger

          The manner of carrying the Merger into effect, and the manner and 
basis of converting the shares of the Constituent Corporations into shares 
of the Surviving Corporation are as follows:

 

 



Conversion of Surviving Corporation Common Stock. At the Effective Date, 
each share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Surviving 
Corporation (such shares, collectively, Surviving Corporation Common Stock
, and each, a Share) outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Date 
other than Dissenting Shares (as hereinafter defined), shall be converted 
automatically into, and shall thereafter represent the right to receive, 
$____ in cash (the Merger Consideration). All outstanding Shares that 
have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as 
provided in this section shall be automatically cancelled and shall cease 
to exist, and the holders of certificates which immediately prior to the 
Effective Date represented such Shares shall cease to have any rights with 
respect to such Shares other than the right to receive the Merger 
Consideration.

- 2 -

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

 



Conversion of Merged Corporation Common Stock. Each share of common stock, 
par value $.01 per share, of the Merged Corporation issued and outstanding 
immediately prior to the Effective Date shall be converted into and become 
one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par 
value $.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, 
powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the 
only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. From 
and after the Effective Date, all certificates representing the common 
stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the 
number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which 
they were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

 

 



Dissenters Rights. If required by the MBCA (but only to the extent 
required thereby), Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior 
to the Effective Date and that are held by holders of such Shares who have 
not voted in favor of the approval and adoption of this Plan of Merger or 
consented thereto in writing and who have properly exercised appraisal 
rights with respect thereto in accordance with, and who have complied with, 
Section 302A.473 of the MBCA (the Dissenting Shares) will not be 
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and holders 
of such Dissenting Shares will be entitled to receive payment of the fair 
value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of such 
Section 302A.473 unless and until any such holder fails to perfect or 
effectively waives, withdraws or loses his, her or its rights to appraisal 
and payment under the MBCA. If, after the Effective Date, any such holder 
fails to perfect or effectively waives, withdraws or loses such right, such 
Dissenting Shares will thereupon be treated as if they had been converted 
into and have become exchangeable for, at the Effective Date, the right to 
receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, and the 
Surviving Corporation shall remain liable for payment of the Merger 
Consideration for such Shares. At the Effective Date, any holder of 
Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect to the 
Surviving Corporation, except the rights provided in Section 302A.473 of 
the MBCA and as provided in the previous sentence.

ARTICLE VI
Effect of the Merger

          At the Effective Date of the Merger, the Surviving Corporation 
shall succeed to and shall possess and enjoy all the rights, privileges, 
immunities, powers and franchises, both of a public and private nature, of 
the Constituent Corporations, and all property, real, personal, and mixed, 
including patents, trademarks, tradenames, and all debts due to either of 
the Constituent Corporations on whatever account, for stock subscriptions 
as well as for all other things in action or all other rights belonging to 
either of said corporations; and all said property, rights, privileges, 
immunities, powers and franchises, and all and every other interest shall 
be thereafter the property of the Surviving Corporation as effectively as 
they were of the respective Constituent Corporations, and the title of any 
real estate vested by deed or otherwise in either of said Constituent 
Corporations shall not revert or be in any way impaired by reason of the 
Merger; provided, however, that all rights of creditors and all liens upon 
any property of either of

- 3 -

------------------------------------------------------------------------

said Constituent Corporations shall be preserved unimpaired, limited in 
lien to the property affected by such liens prior to the Effective Date of 
the Merger, and all debts, liabilities, and duties of said Constituent 
Corporations, respectively, shall thenceforth attach to the Surviving 
Corporation and may be enforced against it to the same extent as if said 
debts, liabilities, and duties had been incurred or contracted in the first 
instance by the Surviving Corporation.

ARTICLE VII
Filing of Plan of Merger

          Upon adoption and approval of the Plan of Merger by the Boards of 
Directors and shareholders of the Constituent of Corporations in accordance 
with Section 302A.613 of the Minnesota Business Corporation Act, Articles 
of Merger in accordance with Section 302A.615 of the Minnesota Business 
Corporation Act shall be executed and delivered to the Secretary of State 
of the State of Minnesota for filing as provided by the Minnesota Business 
Corporation Act. The Constituent Corporations shall also cause to be 
performed all necessary acts within the State of Minnesota and elsewhere to 
effectuate the Merger.

Exhibit B
 
VOTING AGREEMENT

                VOTING AGREEMENT, dated as of November 5, 2010 (this “
Agreement”), by and among CARDIONET, INC., a Delaware corporation (“Parent
”), and ____________________________ (“Shareholder”), a shareholder of 
BIOTEL INC., a Minnesota corporation (the “Company”). 

                WHEREAS, concurrently herewith, Parent, GARDEN MERGER SUB., 
INC., a Minnesota corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (“
Merger Sub”), and the Company are entering into an Agreement and Plan of 
Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), pursuant to which (and subject to the 
terms and conditions set forth therein) Merger Sub will merge with and into 
the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation and a 
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (the “Merger”); and

                WHEREAS, in order to induce Parent and Merger Sub to enter 
into the Merger Agreement and to proceed with the transactions contemplated 
thereby, including the Merger, Parent and Shareholder are entering into 
this Agreement; and

                WHEREAS, Shareholder acknowledges that Parent and Merger 
Sub are entering into the Merger Agreement in reliance on the 
representations, warranties, covenants and other agreements of Shareholder 
set forth in this Agreement and would not enter into the Merger Agreement 
if Shareholder did not enter into this Agreement. 

                NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the 
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements herein contained, and 
intending to be legally bound hereby, Parent and Shareholder hereby 
represent, warrant, covenant and agree as follows:  

                1.  Shareholder represents and warrants that:  

                                    a.  Shareholder owns of record and
    beneficially good and valid title to all of the shares of the capital
    stock of the Company, and options to acquire shares of capital stock of
    the Company, shown on Exhibit A attached hereto, free and clear of any
    and all mortgages, liens, encumbrances, charges, claims, restrictions,
    pledges, security interests, voting trusts or agreements, or
    impositions, except as otherwise disclosed on Exhibit A, and such
    shares represent all of the shares, or rights to acquire shares, of
    capital stock of the Company owned by Shareholder.  For purposes
    hereof, the capital stock of the Company and the options to acquire
    capital stock of the Company set forth on Exhibit A attached hereto
    shall be referred to herein as the “Stock”. 

                                    b.  The execution and delivery of this
    Agreement by Shareholder does not, and the performance by Shareholder
    of its obligations hereunder will not, constitute a violation of,
    conflict with, result in a default (or an event which, with notice or
    lapse of time or both, would result in default) under, or result in the
    creation of any lien on any such Stock under, (i) any contract,
    commitment or agreement, to which Shareholder is a party or by which
    Shareholder is bound, (ii) any judgment, order or ruling applicable to
    Shareholder, or (iii) the organizational documents of Shareholder, if
    applicable. 

                                    c.  Shareholder has full power and
    authority to execute, deliver and perform this Agreement, to vote the
    Stock as required herein and to consummate the transactions
    contemplated hereby.  The execution, delivery and performance of this
    Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
    have been duly and validly authorized and no other actions on the part
    of the Shareholder are required in order to consummate the transaction
    contemplated hereby.  This Agreement has been duly and validly executed
    and delivered by Shareholder and constitutes a valid and binding
    agreement of Shareholder, enforceable against Shareholder in accordance
    with its terms.

                2.  When a meeting of the shareholders of the Company is 
held for the purpose of considering the Merger Agreement and the Merger 
(such meeting referred to herein as the “Meeting”), Shareholder shall (a) 
appear at the Meeting or otherwise cause the Stock to be counted as present 
at the Meeting for the purpose of establishing a quorum; (b) at the 
Meeting, vote, or cause to be voted, all of the Stock, in person or by 
proxy, for approval of the Merger Agreement and the transactions 
contemplated thereby, including the Merger; and (c) at the Meeting (or any 
other meeting of shareholders of the Company), vote, or cause to be voted, 
all of the Stock, in person or by proxy, against any action that is 
intended, or could reasonably be expected, to impede, interfere with, 
delay, postpone, or adversely affect the transactions contemplated by the 
Merger Agreement, including the Merger, unless and until the Company has 
terminated the Merger Agreement in accordance with the terms and conditions 
of the Merger Agreement. 

                3.  Shareholder hereby grants an irrevocable proxy 
appointing Parent, by its duly authorized officers and representatives, as 
Shareholder’s sole and exclusive and true and lawful agent and 
attorney-in-fact, with full power of substitution, to vote all Stock that 
Shareholder is entitled to vote, express consent or dissent or otherwise to 
utilize such voting power in such manner and upon any of the matters 
referred to in Paragraph 2 above, to the same extent and with the same 
effect as Shareholder might or could do under any applicable laws or 
regulations governing the rights and powers of shareholders of the Company. 
 This proxy shall become effective as of the date hereof and shall expire 
upon termination of this Agreement.  Shareholder hereby affirms that this 
proxy is coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable and binding upon 
any and all transferees of the Stock so long as it remains in effect 
pursuant to the terms hereof. 

                4.  The proxy granted by Shareholder pursuant to Paragraph 
3 above and Shareholder’s entrance into this Agreement is in consideration 
of Parent’s entrance into the Merger Agreement.  The proxy granted by 
Shareholder pursuant to Paragraph 3 above is meant to secure Shareholder’s 
performance of this Agreement.  This proxy/power of attorney shall not 
terminate on disability of the Shareholder.  Shareholder hereby revokes any 
proxy previously granted by Shareholder with respect to the Stock. 

                5.  Shareholder will not, nor will Shareholder permit any 
entity under Shareholder’s control to, deposit any of the Stock in a voting 
trust or subject any of the Stock to any arrangement with respect to the 
voting of the Stock in any manner inconsistent with this Agreement. 

                6.  Shareholder will not sell, transfer, pledge, give, 
hypothecate, assign or otherwise alienate or transfer, by proxy or 
otherwise (including any transfer by operation of law), the Stock or any of 
Shareholder’s voting rights with respect to the Stock, except to a person 
who is a party to a voting agreement with Parent in the form of this 
Agreement. 

                7.  Shareholder expressly agrees and acknowledges that 
irreparable damage would occur in the event any of the provisions of this 
Agreement were not performed in accordance with the terms hereof, and that 
Parent shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, in 
addition to any other remedy at law or equity. 

                8.  This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement of 
Shareholder with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all 
other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, of 
Shareholder with respect to the subject matter hereof, and shall be binding 
upon the successors and assigns (as applicable) of Shareholder.  This 
Agreement shall terminate automatically upon the termination of the Merger 
Agreement. 

                9.  This Agreement will be governed by and construed in 
accordance with the laws of the State of Minnesota regardless of the laws 
that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of 
laws thereof. 

                10.  Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall 
have the meanings given to them in the Merger Agreement. 

                11.  It is understood and hereby agreed that this Agreement 
relates solely to the capacity of Shareholder as a shareholder or 
beneficial owner of the Stock and is not in any way intended to affect the 
exercise of Shareholder’s responsibilities and fiduciary duties as a 
director or officer of the Company or any of its subsidiaries.
