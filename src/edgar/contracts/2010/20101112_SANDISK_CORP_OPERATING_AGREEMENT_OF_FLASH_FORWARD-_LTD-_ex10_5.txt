the designating Member and may be removed as such, with or without cause,

each Executive Officer, audited consolidated and consolidating balance 
sheets of the Company as of the end of such Fiscal Year and the related 
audited consolidated and consolidating statements of operations, the

Year (or similar statements if such statements change as the result of 
changes in Japanese GAAP), together with appropriate notes to such 
consolidated financial statements, and in each case setting forth in 
comparative form the corresponding figures for the preceding Fiscal Year 
and for the budget for the Fiscal Year just completed.  Such financial 
statements shall be accompanied by (i) the report of the Accountants to the 
effect that such financial statements (except for the comparison to the 
budget) have been prepared in conformity with Japanese GAAP (except as 
otherwise specified in such report) and that the audit of such financial 
statements has been performed in accordance with Japanese GAAP and (ii) a 
report as to all transactions (including the nature, type and amount) 
between the Company and each Member and their respective Affiliates.  The 
Company shall conduct its business such that the report of the Accountants 
shall not contain any qualifications as to the scope of the audit or with 
respect to the Company’s compliance with Japanese GAAP, except for changes 
in methods of accounting in which such Accountants concur and except that 
the foregoing shall not be deemed to obligate any Member to contribute any 
capital to the Company.  The Company shall also provide SanDisk with an 
English version of such report, which shall contain sufficient data to 
enable SanDisk to prepare a reconciliation of the Company’s financial 
reports from Japanese GAAP to United States GAAP.  The Company shall 
deliver to SanDisk, at SanDisk’s request and expense, any other financial

for the Fiscal Year to date (or similar statements if such statements 
change as the result of changes in Japanese GAAP), in each case setting 
forth in comparative form the corresponding figures for the preceding 
Fiscal Quarter, for the corresponding Fiscal Quarter of the preceding 
Fiscal Year and for the budget for the Fiscal Quarter just completed and 
for the Fiscal Year to date.
 
(ii)  
The financial statements for such Fiscal Quarter shall be accompanied by a 
certificate of the principal accounting or financial officer of the Company 
to the effect that such financial statements have been prepared under such 
officer’s supervision and that, although such financial statements do not 
contain the footnotes and other disclosures required to be presented in 
interim financial statements by Japanese GAAP, such financial statements, 
in such officer’s judgment, fairly present the financial condition and 
results of operations of the Company as of the date and for the periods 
indicated, subject to normal recurring year-end audit adjustments.  The 
Company shall deliver to SanDisk, at SanDisk’s request and expense and, 
except as otherwise provided herein, in the same manner as is delivered in 
connection with the Operating Agreement of Flash Alliance, Ltd. dated as of 
July 7, 2006, by and between Toshiba and SanDisk (Ireland) Ltd., any other

efforts to make available to such Member the Accountants and the key 
employees of the Company for interviews to verify any information furnished 
or to enable such Member otherwise to review the Company and its

9.  
Share of Contribution; Disposition of Interests
 
9.1  
Restrictions on Transfer of Interests.
 
(a)  
No Member (nor any permitted transferees of any Member) may Transfer any 
interest in the Company, including any of such Member’s Interests, to any 
Person, except by a Change of Control; provided, that any Member may 
Transfer all of its interest in the Company, including all of its 
Interests, subject to the Companies Act, to any one (1) of their respective 
Affiliates, with the prior written consent of every other Member, which 
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; and provided, further, that (i) 
the transferee agrees in writing to become a party hereto and assumes all 
the obligations of the transferring Member hereunder and under each other 
FF Operative Document to which the transferring Member is a party (except 
to the extent the express terms of the Patent Indemnification Agreement 
condition its transferability on the consent of the non-transferring Member 
and such Member has not consented to Transfer thereof), and (ii) 
immediately after giving effect to such Transfer, no Event of Default or an 
event or condition that with the giving of notice or lapse of time or both 
would constitute an Event of Default with respect to the transferee Member 
shall exist.  Following the effectiveness of any such Transfer, the 
transferring Member shall no longer have the transferred right, title or 
interest in the Company or any rights under this Agreement and the 
transferee shall be substituted as a Member for all purposes of this 
Agreement.  The transferring Member shall, however, remain responsible for 
all obligations under this Agreement and the other FF Operative Documents 
for any transferee which is an Affiliate of the transferring Member and 
shall not be released or discharged from any existing liability or 
obligation to any Person.  Any subsequent Transfer of an ownership interest 
in such Affiliate by the transferring Member shall be deemed to constitute 
a Transfer of Interests requiring compliance with this Section 9.1.
 
(b)  
If a Member Transfers its entire interest in the Company pursuant to 
Section 9.1(a), the transferee shall succeed to all the rights and 
obligations of such Member under this Agreement.
 
(c)  
Any Member may agree to pay amounts equal to distributions received by such 
Member from the Company to a third party in its sole discretion pursuant to 
a Permissible Assignment Agreement.  “Permissible Assignment Agreement” 
means an agreement between a Member and another Person (the “Permissible 
Assignee”) which:
 
(i)  
provides for the grant by such Member to the Permissible Assignee of the 
right to receive amounts equal to distributions received by such Member 
from the Company pursuant to Section 6 or 11 of this Agreement, but does 
not give the Permissible Assignee any Interests or any other rights 
whatsoever with respect to the Company;
 
(ii)  
provides that under no circumstances (including any Bankruptcy Event in 
respect of such Member) may any claim be made by the Permissible Assignee 
against the Company or any such Member or any Affiliate of any such Member 
or any of their respective assets, under or in connection with such 
agreement, even if such Member defaults in performance thereunder;
 
(iii)  
provides that the rights of the Permissible Assignee under such agreement 
may not be transferred without the prior written consent of each Member and 
that any such Transfer without such consents shall be null and void;
 
(iv)  
may not be amended, nor any provision thereof waived, in a manner that 
would cause it not to be a Permissible Assignment Agreement, without the 
prior written consent of the non-assigning Member;
 
(v)  
provides that the assigning Member is authorized to Transfer its entire 
interest in the Company pursuant to Section 9.1(a) free and clear of any 
interest of the Permissible Assignee and without any liability on the part 
of the transferee thereunder to the Permissible Assignee; and
 
(vi)  
contains an express acknowledgment by the Permissible Assignee, for the 
benefit of the non-assigning Member and the Company, to the effect of 
clauses (i)-(v) above.
 
    The assigning Member shall ensure that any payment due to a Permissible
    Assignee pursuant to or in connection with a Permissible Assignment
    Agreement shall be made in full to such Permissible Assignee when due.

cause its Affiliates and the Company to take all reasonable actions 
necessary or appropriate to effectuate the transactions contemplated by

(a)  
The Members shall endeavor to settle, through their respective designees to

including without limitation, failure by the Board of Executive Officers to 
reach agreement (or failure to take a vote) on any matter requiring 
Executive Officers approval pursuant to Section 5.1(d) (Matters Requiring 
the Approval of the Board of Executive Officers).  The Members shall 
attempt to resolve the issue or proposed action in question, to the extent 
practicable, in a manner consistent with the Company’s most recently 
approved Business Plan, unless the issue in dispute is the adoption of a 
new Business Plan, in which case, except as provided for in Section 6.3 of 
the Master Agreement, the provisions of Sections 10.3(c), (e) and (f) shall 
apply.
 
(b)  
If (i) the Members are unable to agree on any matter requiring the approval 
of the Members pursuant to Section 4.1(a) (Matters Requiring the Approval 
of the Members), (ii) the Board of Executive Officers is unable to agree on 
any matter requiring the approval of the Board of Executive Officers

Executive Officers) (other than the approval of any Business Plan, with 
respect to which the failure to agree shall be governed by Sections

Officers are otherwise unable to resolve a dispute on any other item (other

Member may bring the matter to the attention of the General Manager Memory 
Division, Semiconductor Company of Toshiba, and the Chief Operating Officer 
of SanDisk (the “Designated Individuals”), who will attempt to find a 
resolution.  If the matter has not been resolved within thirty (30) days of 
referral to the Designated Individuals, the matter will be referred to the 
Management Representatives for a final decision, which decision will be 
final and binding on the Company and the Members with respect to any matter

the Management Representatives, such decision shall be implemented by the 
Company.  Should no decision be reached within ninety (90) days after 
submission of the matter to the Management Representatives, and unless the 
Members have agreed to continue operations under the most recently approved 
Business Plan until a new Business Plan is approved, then within ten (10) 
Business Days thereafter any Member may elect by written notice to all 
other Members to declare a deadlock (“Deadlock”), except with respect to 
any issue where the Master Agreement expressly prohibits declaration of a

right of first offer to acquire the Company’s tangible personal property.  
Each of the Members shall be furnished with a statement setting forth the 
assets and liabilities of the Company as of the date of the complete 
liquidation of the Company.  The Accountants shall review the final

12.  
Indemnification and Insurance
 
12.1  
Indemnification.
 
(a)  
Subject to Section 12.1(c), the Company shall indemnify each Person who was 
or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, 
pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, 
administrative or investigative (including an action by or in the right of 
a Member or the Company), by reason of the fact that such Person is or was 
a Member or is or was or has agreed to become an Executive Officer or is or 
was serving or has agreed to serve at the request of the Company as an 
Executive Officer, officer, employee or agent of the Company or of another 
partnership, corporation, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, arising 
from any action alleged to have been taken in any such capacity or by 
reason of any liability or obligation of the Company, against any and all 
losses, damages, liabilities, costs, charges, expenses (including interest, 
penalties and reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses), judgments, fines 
and amounts paid in settlement (collectively, “Losses”) actually and 
reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in connection with such action, 
suit or proceeding and any appeal therefrom.  Without limiting the 
generality of the foregoing, any of such Losses shall be deemed to arise 
out of a Company liability or obligation if it arises out of or is based 
upon the conduct of the business of the Company (or any of its 
Subsidiaries) or the ownership of the property of the Company (or any of 
its Subsidiaries).
 
(b)  
The indemnification provided under this Section 12.1 shall inure to the 
benefit of the successors, heirs and personal representatives of any Person 
entitled to the benefit of such indemnification.  Such indemnification 
shall be a contract right and shall include the right to be paid advances 
of reasonable expenses incurred by any such Person in connection with such 
action, suit or proceeding.

Exhibit 10.5
FOIA Confidential Treatment Requested
Execution Version
 
(c)  
The indemnification provided under this Section 12.1 shall not inure to the 
benefit of any Person in respect of Losses to the extent that such Losses 
(i) arise out of or are based upon the gross negligence or willful 
misconduct of such Person or (ii) constitute a tax, levy or similar 
governmental charge not imposed upon the Company (or any of its 
Subsidiaries) or on their respective properties.  The indemnification 
provided under this Section 12.1 shall also not be available to any Person 
in respect of any Losses if a judgment or other final adjudication adverse 
to such Person establishes (x) that such Person’s acts were committed in 
bad faith or were the result of active and deliberate dishonesty and were 
material to the cause of action so adjudicated or (y) that such Person 
gained in fact a financial profit or other advantage to which such Person 
was not legally entitled.  It is understood and agreed that, for the 
purposes of this Section 12.1, Losses shall be deemed not to arise out of 
or be based upon the gross negligence or willful misconduct of a Person 
solely because it arises out of or is based upon the gross negligence, 
willful misconduct, bad faith or active and deliberate dishonesty of an 
Executive Officer, officer or employee of such Person if at the time of 
such gross negligence, willful misconduct, bad faith or active and 
deliberate dishonesty, such Executive Officer, officer or employee was also 
a member of the SanDisk Team or an Executive Officer acting in his capacity 
as such.
 
(d)  
The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, 
settlement, conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent 
shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the indemnified Person did 
not meet the standard set forth in Section 12.1(c) (Indemnification).
 
12.2  
Insurance.  The Company may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, 
purchase and maintain insurance against any liability that may be asserted 
against any Person entitled to indemnity pursuant to Section 12.1.
 
12.3  
Indemnification by the Members.
 
(a)  
Each Member agrees to, and does hereby, indemnify and hold harmless the 
Company and the other Member from and against any and all Losses arising 
out of, or based upon, the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such 
Member under this Agreement or such Member exceeding its authority under 
this Agreement.
 
(b)  
The provisions of this Section 12.3 shall survive each of the termination 
of this Agreement, the dissolution of the Company and the withdrawal of any 
Member.
 
12.4  
Assertion of Claims.
 
(a)  
In the event that a Person (the “Indemnified Party”) desires to assert its 
right to indemnification from a Person (an “Indemnifying Party”) required 
to indemnify such Indemnified Party under this Section 12, the Indemnified 
Party will give the Indemnifying Party prompt notice of the claim giving 
rise thereto (a “Claim”), and the Indemnifying Party shall undertake the 
defense thereof (unless the Claim is asserted against or related to or 
results from any action or failure to take action by such Indemnifying 
Party).  The failure to promptly notify the Indemnifying Party hereunder 
shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder, 
except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced by 
the failure to so notify promptly.
 
(b)  
The Indemnified Party shall not settle or compromise any Claim without the 
written consent of the Indemnifying Party unless the Indemnified Party 
agrees in writing to forego any and all claims for indemnification from the 
Indemnifying Party with respect to such Claim.  However, if the 
Indemnifying Party, within a reasonable time after notice of any such 
Claim, fails to defend such Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the 
right to undertake the defense, compromise or settlement of such Claim on 
behalf of and for the account and risk of the Indemnifying Party, subject 
to the right of the Indemnifying Party to assume the defense of such Claim 
at any time prior to settlement, compromise or final determination thereof.
 
(c)  
IF THE INDEMNIFYING PARTY HAS UNDERTAKEN THE DEFENSE OF A CLAIM AND (I) IF 
THERE IS A REASONABLE EXPECTATION THAT (X) A CLAIM MAY MATERIALLY AND 
ADVERSELY AFFECT THE INDEMNIFIED PARTY OTHER THAN AS A RESULT OF MONEY 
DAMAGES OR OTHER MONEY PAYMENTS OR (Y) THE INDEMNIFIED PARTY OR MEMBERS MAY 
HAVE LEGAL DEFENSES AVAILABLE TO IT OR THEM THAT ARE DIFFERENT FROM OR 
ADDITIONAL TO THE DEFENSES AVAILABLE TO THE INDEMNIFYING PARTY, OR (II) IF 
THE INDEMNIFYING PARTY SHALL NOT HAVE EMPLOYED COUNSEL REASONABLY 
SATISFACTORY TO THE INDEMNIFIED PARTY, THE INDEMNIFIED PARTY SHALL 
NEVERTHELESS HAVE THE RIGHT, AT THE INDEMNIFYING PARTY’S COST AND EXPENSE, 
TO DEFEND SUCH CLAIM.
