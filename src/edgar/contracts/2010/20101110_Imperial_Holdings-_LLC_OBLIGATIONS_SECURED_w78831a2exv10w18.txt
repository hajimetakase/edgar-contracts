THE LOANS

          Section 2.01 Commitments.

               (a) Subject to the terms and conditions and relying upon the 
representations and warranties herein set forth, each Lender severally 
agrees to make one or more Term Loans to the Borrower (i) on the Effective 
Date and (ii) prior to the Term Loan Commitment Termination Date, not more 
than one time each week thereafter (unless an additional weekly borrowing 
date is consented to by the Agent and the Required Lenders), in the case of 
all Term Loans, in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed the amount 
of such Lenders initial Term Loan Commitment.

               (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the aggregate 
principal amount of the Term Loan made on the Effective Date and on any 
borrowing date shall not exceed the lesser of (x) the undrawn Total Term 
Loan Commitment at such time and (y) the Maximum Tranche Amount with 
respect to any applicable Insurance Premium Loans being acquired by the 
Borrower with the proceeds of such Term Loan, (ii) the aggregate principal 
amount of all Term Loans made at any time pursuant to this Agreement shall 
not exceed the lesser of (x) the initial Total Term Loan Commitment on the 
Effective Date and (y) an amount which will not result in any Borrowing 
Base Deficit existing at such time, provided, that, for purposes of this 
Section 2.01(b)(ii)(y), the PIK Interest Amount shall be included in the 
principal amount of the Term Loans. Any amounts paid directly or indirectly 
by the Agents and the Lenders to the Collateral

25

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

Value Insurer or the Contingent Collateral Value Insurer for coverage under 
the Collateral Value Policy or the Contingent Collateral Value Policy, as 
applicable, shall be deemed to be, and shall for all purposes of this 
Agreement be treated as, Term Loans made to the Borrower hereunder. Any 
principal amount of the Term Loan which is repaid or prepaid may not be 
reborrowed. The Total Term Loan Commitment shall be permanently reduced 
immediately and without further action on the date of funding of each Term 
Loan in an amount equal to such funded Term Loan. Each Lenders Term Loan 
Commitment shall be permanently reduced immediately and without further 
action on the date of funding of each Term Loan in an amount equal to such 
Lenders Pro Rata Share of such funded Term Loan. Each Lenders Term Loan 
Commitment shall terminate immediately and without further action on the 
Term Loan Commitment Termination Date after giving effect to the funding of 
such Lenders Term Loan Commitment, if any, on such date.

          Section 2.02 Making the Loans.

               (a) The Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent prior 
telephonic notice (immediately confirmed in writing, in substantially the 
form of Exhibit B hereto (a Notice of Borrowing)), not later than 12:00 
noon (New York City time) on the date which is three (3) Business Days 
prior to the date of the proposed Loan (or such shorter period as the 
Administrative Agent is willing to accommodate from time to time, but in no 
event later than 12:00 noon (New York City time) on the borrowing date of 
the proposed Loan). Such Notice of Borrowing shall (i) be irrevocable, (ii) 
specify (A) the principal amount of the proposed Loan, (B) the use of the 
proceeds of such proposed Loan, and (C) the proposed borrowing date, which 
must be a Business Day and shall not occur more than one time each week 
unless an additional weekly borrowing date is consented to by the Agent and 
the Required Lenders and (iii) be delivered to the Administrative Agent 
together with the documents required by Section 5.02(e). The Administrative 
Agent and the Lenders may act without liability upon the basis of written, 
telecopied or telephonic notice believed by the Administrative Agent in 
good faith to be from the Borrower (or from any Authorized Officer thereof 
designated in writing purportedly from the Borrower to the Administrative 
Agent). The Borrower hereby waives the right to dispute the Administrative 
Agents record of the terms of any such telephonic Notice of Borrowing. The 
Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be entitled to rely conclusively 
on any Authorized Officers authority to request a Loan on behalf of the 
Borrower until the Administrative Agent receives written notice to the 
contrary. The Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall have no duty to 
verify the authenticity of the signature appearing on any written Notice of 
Borrowing.

               (b) Each Notice of Borrowing pursuant to this Section 2.02 
shall be irrevocable and the Borrower shall be bound to make a borrowing in 
accordance therewith.

               (c) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection 2.02(c), 
all Loans under this Agreement shall be made by the Lenders simultaneously 
and proportionately to their Pro Rata Shares of the Total Term Loan 
Commitment, it being understood that no Lender shall be responsible for any 
default by any other Lender in that other Lenders obligations to make a 
Loan requested hereunder, nor shall the Commitment of any Lender be 
increased or decreased as a result of the default by any other Lender in 
that other Lenders obligation to make a Loan requested hereunder, and each 
Lender shall be obligated to make the Loans required to be made by it by 
the terms of this Agreement regardless of the failure by any other Lender.

          Section 2.03 Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt. The 
outstanding principal of the Term Loans (including the PIK Interest Amount) 
shall be due and payable on the Final Maturity Date.

               (b) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual 
practice an account or accounts evidencing the Indebtedness of the Borrower 
to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the 
amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time 
to time hereunder.

               (c) The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in 
which it shall record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, (ii) the 
amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and 
payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of 
any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of 
the Lenders and each Lenders share thereof.

               (d) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to 
paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section shall be prima facie evidence of the 
existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; provided that 
the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such 
accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation 
of the Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this 
Agreement.

               (e) Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be 
evidenced by a promissory note. In such event, the Borrower shall execute 
and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to the order of such 
Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered 
assigns) in a form furnished by the Collateral Agent and reasonably 
acceptable to the Borrower. Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such 
promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after 
assignment pursuant to Section 12.07) be represented by one or more 
promissory notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named 
therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note, to such payee 
and its registered assigns).

          Section 2.04 Interest.

               (a) The Term Loan shall bear interest on the principal 
amount thereof from time to time outstanding, from January 1, 2009 until 
such principal amount becomes due, at a rate per annum equal to 20.00%; 
provided, however, that, subject to paragraph (c) of this Section 2.04, all 
of such interest (the PIK Interest Amount) shall be paid-in-kind by being 
added to the outstanding principal balance of such Term Loan. Any interest 
to be capitalized shall be capitalized on the first day of each month, 
commencing on the first day of the month following the Effective Date and 
added to the then outstanding principal amount of the Term Loans and, 
thereafter, shall bear interest as provided hereunder as if it had 
originally been part of the outstanding principal of the Term Loans.

               (b) Default Interest. To the extent permitted by law and 
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section, upon the 
occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, the principal 
of, and all accrued and unpaid interest on, all Loans, fees, indemnities or 
any other Obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement and the other 
Loan

27

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

Documents, shall bear interest, from the date such Event of Default 
occurred until the date such Event of Default is cured or waived in writing 
in accordance herewith, at a rate per annum equal at all times to 23.00%.

               (c) Interest Payment. Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this 
Section 2.04, interest on each Loan shall be payable, without duplication:

                    (i) on each date Collections are received if sufficient 
Collections or other funds are available hereunder for the payment of 
interest pursuant to Section 2.05(d); and

                    (ii) on the Final Maturity Date;

     provided, that interest payable pursuant to paragraph (b) of this 
Section 2.04 shall be payable on demand. The Borrower hereby authorizes the 
Administrative Agent to, and the Administrative Agent may, from time to 
time, charge the Loan Account pursuant to Section 4.01 with the amount of 
any interest payment due hereunder.

               (d) General. All interest shall be computed on the basis of 
a year of 360 days for the actual number of days, including the first day 
but excluding the last day, elapsed.

          Section 2.05 Reduction of Commitment; Prepayment of Loans.

               (a) Reduction of Commitments. The Total Term Loan Commitment 
shall terminate at 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the Term Loan 
Commitment Termination Date. In addition, the Total Term Loan Commitment 
and the Term Loan Commitment of each Lender shall be reduced in accordance 
with Section 2.01(b).

               (b) Optional Prepayment.

                    (i) Term Loan. The Borrower may, upon at least sixty 
(60) Business Days prior written notice to the Administrative Agent, 
prepay the principal of the Term Loan, in whole or in part. Each prepayment 
made pursuant to this clause 2.05(b)(i) shall be accompanied by the payment 
of accrued interest to the date of such payment on the amount prepaid.

                    (ii) Prepayment In Full. The Borrower may, upon at 
least sixty (60) days prior written notice to the Administrative Agent, 
terminate this Agreement by paying to the Administrative Agent, in cash, 
the Obligations, in full. If the Borrower has sent a notice of termination 
pursuant to this clause (ii), then the Lenders obligations to extend 
credit hereunder shall terminate and the Borrower shall be obligated to 
repay the Obligations, in full, on the date set forth as the date of 
termination of this Agreement in such notice.

               (c) Mandatory Prepayment. (i) On each date on which 
Collections are received by the Borrower or the Servicer with respect to 
any Insurance Premium Loan, Borrower shall repay the principal amount of 
the related Tranche of the Term Loan, to the extent of Collections 
available therefor in accordance with Section 2.05(d) hereof.

28

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

                    (ii) If on any day a Borrowing Base Deficit exists, on 
such date Borrower shall make a prepayment of the principal amount of the 
Loans in an amount equal to such Borrowing Base Deficit.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.05(c), during 
the period from the Effective Date to the Term Loan Commitment Termination 
Date payments received by any Agent shall held by such Agent and delivered 
to the Lender entitled to receive such payment only upon the consent of the 
Required Funded Lenders.

               (d) Application of Payments. On each day that Collections 
(other than Salvage Collections, but including all payments made by the 
Collateral Value Insurer or Contingent Collateral Value Insurer to the 
Borrower under the Collateral Value Policy or Contingent Collateral Value 
Policy) are received by the Servicer, the Originator, the Borrower, or the 
Insurance Collateral Agent or any other Person on their behalf in respect 
of any Insurance Premium Loan (or related Life Insurance Policy) financed 
hereunder or the Collateral Value Policy or Contingent Collateral Value 
Policy, the Borrower shall (or shall cause such other Person to) on the 
Business Day of such receipt, transfer such amounts to the Collection 
Account for distribution in accordance with this Section 2.05(d). On each 
such date, as long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is 
continuing, the Borrower shall distribute (from such amounts so deposited 
in the Collection Account with respect thereto) such Collections with 
respect to the Covered Portion of an Insurance Premium Loan (other than 
Salvage Collections) in the following order of priority:

                    (i) first, to pay the Servicer an amount equal to the 
accrued and unpaid Servicing Fees then due and payable in accordance with 
the Transaction Documents until paid in full;

                    (ii) second, to pay interest then due and payable in 
respect of the Loans until paid in full, including all previously accrued

Interest Amount),

                    (iii) third, to pay the Insurance Collateral Agent an 
amount equal to any fees, expense reimbursements, indemnities and other

                    (v) fifth, any remaining Collections with respect to 
the Covered Portion of an Insurance Premium Loan on such date shall be paid 
to the Borrower, for its own account.

     On each such date, after giving effect to the application of 
Collections with respect to the Covered Portion of an Insurance Premium 
Loan set forth above, as long as no Default or Event of Default has 
occurred and is continuing, the Borrower shall retain (from such amounts so 
deposited in the Collection Account with respect thereto) such Collections 
with respect to the Uncovered Portion of an Insurance Premium Loan (other 
than Salvage Collections).

29

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

     At any time a Default or Event of Default has occurred and is

that is financed by a Term Loan that is not a Specified Term Loan shall be 
applied first, to Obligations with respect to Term Loans that are not 
Specified Term Loans and second, to Obligations with respect to Specified 
Terms Loans.

               (e) Salvage Collections. Notwithstanding the provisions of 
Section 2.05(d), Section 4.03(b) or any other provision of this Agreement, 
on each date which Collections are received with respect to any Insurance 
Premium Loan for which there are Salvage Collections, the Borrower, the 
Lenders or the Agents shall, to the extent received by them, distribute 
such Salvage Collections on such date to the Collateral Value Insurer or 
the Contingent Collateral Value Insurer that paid the claim to the 
Borrower.

               (f) Interest and Fees. Any prepayment made pursuant to this 
Section 2.05 shall be accompanied by accrued interest on the principal 
amount being prepaid to the date of prepayment and if such prepayment would 
reduce the amount of the outstanding Loans to zero, such prepayment shall 
be accompanied by the payment of all fees accrued to such date pursuant to 
Section 2.06.

               (g) Cumulative Prepayments. Except as otherwise expressly 
provided in this Section 2.05, payments with respect to any subsection of 
this Section 2.05 are in addition to payments made or required to be made 
under any other subsection of this Section 2.05.

          Section 2.06 Fees. From and after the Effective Date and until

Obligations are paid in full, the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative 
Agent for the account of the Agents a non-refundable loan management fee 
(the Loan Management Fee) equal to (x) $15,000 each calendar year if at 
any time during or prior to the start of such calendar year the aggregate 
amount of the Loans provided under this Agreement is greater than or equal 
to $15,000,000 but less than $20,000,000 and (y) $20,000 each calendar year 
if at any time during or prior to the start of such calendar year the 
aggregate amount of the Loans provided under this Agreement is greater than 
or equal to $20,000,000.

          Section 2.07 Securitization. The Borrower hereby acknowledges 
that the Lenders and their Affiliates may sell or securitize the Loans (a 
Securitization) through the pledge of the Loans as collateral security for 
loans to the Lenders or their Affiliates or through the sale of the Loans 
or the issuance of direct or indirect interests in the Loans, which loans 
to the Lenders or their Affiliates or direct or indirect interests will be 
rated by Moodys, Standard & Poors or one or more other rating agencies 
(the Rating Agencies). The Borrower shall

30

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

cooperate with the Lenders and their Affiliates to effect the 
Securitization including, without limitation, by (a) amending this 
Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and executing such additional 
documents, as reasonably requested by the Lenders in connection with the 
Securitization, provided that (i) any such amendment or additional 
documentation does not impose material additional costs on the Borrower and 
(ii) any such amendment or additional documentation does not materially 
adversely affect the rights, or materially increase the obligations, of the 
Borrower under the Loan Documents or change or affect in a manner adverse 
to the Borrower the financial terms of the Loans and (b) providing such 
information as may be reasonably requested by the Lenders in connection 
with the rating of the Loans or the Securitization.

          Section 2.08 Taxes.

               (a) Any and all payments by the Borrower hereunder or under 
any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without 
deduction for any and all present or future taxes, levies, imposts, 
deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities with respect 
thereto, excluding taxes imposed on the net income of any Agent, any Lender 
(or any transferee or assignee thereof, including a participation holder 
(any such entity, a Transferee)) by the jurisdiction in which such Person 
is organized or has its principal lending office (all such nonexcluded 
taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges withholdings and liabilities, 
collectively or individually, Taxes). If the Borrower shall be required 
to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder to any 
Agent, any Lender (or any Transferee), (i) the sum payable shall be 
increased by the amount (an Additional Amount) necessary so that after 
making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to 
additional sums payable under this Section 2.08) such Agent, such Lender 
(or such Transferee) shall receive an amount equal to the sum it would have 
received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower shall make 
such deductions and (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted 
to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

               (b) In addition, the Borrower agrees to pay to the relevant 
Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law any present or 
future stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, 
charges or similar levies that arise from any payment made hereunder or 
from the execution, delivery or registration of, or otherwise with respect 
to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document (Other Taxes). The Borrower 
shall deliver to each Agent and each Lender official receipts in respect of 
any Taxes or Other Taxes payable hereunder promptly after payment of such 
Taxes or Other Taxes.

               (c) The Borrower hereby indemnifies and agrees to hold each 
Agent and each Lender harmless from and against Taxes and Other Taxes 
(including, without limitation, Taxes and Other Taxes imposed on any 
amounts payable under this Section 2.08) paid by such Person, whether or 
not such Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally asserted. Such 
indemnification shall be paid within 10 days from the date on which any 
such Person makes written demand therefore specifying in reasonable detail 
the nature and amount of such Taxes or Other Taxes.

               (d) Each Lender (or Transferee) that is organized under the 
laws of a jurisdiction outside the United States (a Non-U. S. Lender) 
agrees that it shall, no later than the

31

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

Effective Date (or, in the case of a Lender which becomes a party hereto 
pursuant to Section 12.07 hereof after the Effective Date, promptly after 
the date upon which such Lender becomes a party hereto) deliver to the 
Agents one properly completed and duly executed copy of either U.S. 
Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN, W-8ECI or W-8IMY or any subsequent 
versions thereof or successors thereto, in each case claiming complete 
exemption from, or reduced rate of, U.S. Federal withholding tax and 
payments of interest hereunder. In addition, in the case of a Non-U. S. 
Lender claiming exemption from U.S. Federal withholding tax under Section 
871(h) or 881(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, such Non-U. S. Lender hereby 
represents to the Agents and the Borrower that such Non-U. S. Lender is not 
a bank for purposes of Section 881(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, is not 
a 10-percent shareholder (within the meaning of Section 871(h)(3)(B) of the 
Internal Revenue Code) of the Borrower and is not a controlled foreign 
corporation related to the Borrower (within the meaning of Section 
864(d)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code), and such Non-U. S. Lender agrees 
that it shall promptly notify the Agents in the event any such 
representation is no longer accurate. Such forms shall be delivered by each 
Non-U. S. Lender on or before the date it becomes a party to this Agreement 
(or, in the case of a Transferee that is a participation holder, on or 
before the date such participation holder becomes a Transferee hereunder) 
and on or before the date, if any, such Non-U. S. Lender changes its 
applicable lending office by designating a different lending office (a 
New Lending Office). In addition, such Non-U. S. Lender shall deliver such 
forms within 20 days after receipt of a written request therefor from any 
Agent, the assigning Lender or the Lender granting a participation, as 
applicable. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2.08, a 
Non-U. S. Lender shall not be required to deliver any form pursuant to this 
Section 2.08(d) that such Non-U. S. Lender is not legally able to deliver.

               (e) The Borrower shall not be required to indemnify any 
Non-U. S. Lender, or pay any Additional Amounts to any Non-U. S. Lender, in 
respect of United States Federal withholding tax pursuant to this Section 
2.08 to the extent that (i) the obligation to withhold amounts with respect 
to United States Federal withholding tax existed on the date such Non-U .S. 
Lender became a party to this Agreement (or, in the case of a Transferee 
that is a participation holder, on the date such participation holder 
became a Transferee hereunder) or, with respect to payments to a New 
Lending Office, the date such Non-U. S. Lender designated such New Lending 
Office with respect to a Loan; provided, however, that this clause (i) 
shall not apply to the extent the indemnity payment or Additional Amounts 
any Transferee, or Lender (or Transferee) through a New Lending Office, 
would be entitled to receive (without regard to this clause (i)) do not 
exceed the indemnity payment or Additional Amounts that the Person making 
the assignment, participation or transfer to such Transferee, or Lender (or 
Transferee) making the designation of such New Lending Office, would have 
been entitled to receive in the absence of such assignment, participation, 
transfer or designation, or (ii) the obligation to pay such Additional 
Amounts would not have arisen but for a failure by such Non-U. S. Lender to 
comply with the provisions of clause (d) above.

               (f) Any Agent or any Lender (or Transferee) claiming any 
indemnity payment or additional payment amounts payable pursuant to this 
Section 2.08 shall use reasonable efforts (consistent with legal and 
regulatory restrictions) to file any certificate or document reasonably 
requested in writing by the Borrower or to change the jurisdiction of its 
applicable lending office if the making of such a filing or change would 
avoid the need for or reduce the amount of any such indemnity payment or 
additional amount that may thereafter

32

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

accrue, would not require such Agent or such Lender (or Transferee) to 
disclose any information such Agent or such Lender (or Transferee) deems 
confidential and would not, in the sole determination of such Agent or such 
Lender (or Transferee), be otherwise disadvantageous to such Agent or such 
Lender (or Transferee).

               (g) The obligations of the Borrower under this Section 2.08 
shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the 
Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.

          Section 2.09 Increase in Term Loan Commitments.

               (a) Request for Increase. Provided no Default or Event of 
Default then exists or would arise therefrom, upon notice to the 
Administrative Agent (which shall promptly notify the Lenders), the 
Borrower may, prior to September 13, 2009, request an increase in the Term 
Loan Commitments by an amount not exceeding $45,000,000 in the aggregate 
(the Commitment Increase); provided that any such request for a 
Commitment Increase shall be in a minimum amount of $5,000,000. Following 
the delivery by the Borrower of the request, the Administrative Agent and 
the Lenders shall, by notice to the Borrower given not more than 30 
Business Days after the date of receipt of the Offer Notice, either accept 
the Offer or reject the Offer, provided that, the Lenders hall have no 
obligation to accept any request.

               (b) Lender Elections to Increase. Each Lender shall notify 
the Administrative Agent within such time period whether or not it agrees 
to increase its Term Loan Commitment and, if so, whether by an amount equal 
to, greater than, or less than its Pro Rata Share of such requested 
Commitment Increase. Any Lender not responding within such time period 
shall be deemed to have declined to increase its Term Loan Commitment.

               (c) Effective Date and Allocations. If the Term Loan 
Commitments are increased in accordance with this Section 2.09, the 
Administrative Agent shall determine the effective date (the Increase 
Effective Date) and the final allocation of such Commitment Increase. The 
Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of 
the final allocation of such Commitment Increase and the Increase Effective 
Date and, on the Increase Effective Date, (i) the Term Loan Commitments 
under, and for all purposes of, this Agreement shall be increased by the 
aggregate amount of such Commitment Increase, and (ii) Schedule 1.01(A) 
shall be deemed modified, without further action, to reflect the revised 
Term Loan Commitments of the Lenders.

               (d) Conditions to Effectiveness of Commitment Increase. As a 
condition precedent to such Commitment Increase: (i) the Borrower shall 
have delivered to the Administrative Agent a certificate of each Credit 
Party dated as of the Increase Effective Date (in sufficient copies for 
each Lender) signed by an Authorized Officer of such Credit Party (A) 
certifying and attaching the resolutions adopted by such Credit Party 
approving or consenting to such Commitment Increase, and (B) in the case of 
the Borrower, certifying that, before and after giving effect to such 
Commitment Increase, the representations and warranties contained in 
Article VI and the other Loan Documents are true and correct in all 
material respects on and as of the Increase Effective Date, except to the 
extent that such representations and warranties specifically refer to an 
earlier date, in which case they are true and correct in all material 
respects

33

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

as of such earlier date, and except that for purposes of this Section 2.09, 
the representations and warranties contained in subsections (g)(i) and 
(g)(ii) of Section 6.01 shall be deemed to refer to the most recent 
statements furnished pursuant to subsections (a)(i) and (a)(ii), 
respectively, of Section 7.01; (ii) the Borrower shall have paid such fees 
and other compensation to the Agents and Lenders as they require; (iii) the 
Borrower shall have delivered to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders 
an opinion or opinions substantially similar to the opinions delivered on 
the Effective Date from counsel to the Credit Parties reasonably 
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and dated such date; (iv) the 
Borrower shall have delivered such other instruments, documents and 
agreements as the Administrative Agent may reasonably have requested 
including, without limitation, an amendment to this Agreement and the other 
Loan Documents, if required by the Administrative Agent; and (v) no Default 
or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing.

ARTICLE IV

FEES, PAYMENTS AND OTHER COMPENSATION

          Section 4.01 Payments; Computations and Statements. The Borrower 
will make each payment under this Agreement not later than 12:00 noon (New 
York City time) on the day when due, in lawful money of the United States 
of America and in immediately available funds, to the Administrative 
Agents Account. All payments received by the Administrative Agent after 
12:00 noon (New York City time) on any Business Day will be credited to the 
Loan Account on the next succeeding Business Day. All payments shall be 
made by the Borrower without set-off, counterclaim, deduction or other 
defense to the Agents and the Lenders. Except as provided in Section 2.02, 
after receipt, the Administrative Agent will promptly thereafter cause to 
be distributed like funds relating to the payment of principal ratably to 
the Lenders in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares and like funds 
relating to the payment of any other amount payable to any Lender to such 
Lender, in each case to be applied in accordance with the terms of this 
Agreement, provided that the Administrative Agent will cause to be 
distributed all interest and fees received from or for the account of the 
Borrower not less than once each month and in any event promptly after 
receipt thereof. The Lenders and the Borrower hereby authorize the 
Administrative Agent to, and the Administrative Agent may, from time to 
time, charge the Loan Account of the Borrower with any amount due and 
payable by the Borrower under any Loan Document. Each of the Lenders and 
the Borrower agrees that the Administrative Agent shall have the right to 
make such charges whether or not any Default or Event of Default shall have 
occurred and be continuing or whether any of the conditions precedent in 
Section 5.02 have been satisfied. Any amount charged to the Loan Account of 
the Borrower shall be deemed an Obligation hereunder, which shall bear 
interest at the rate applicable to Term Loans. The Lenders and the Borrower 
confirm that any charges which the Administrative Agent may so make to the 
Loan Account of the Borrower as herein provided will be made as an 
accommodation to the Borrower and solely at the Administrative Agents 
discretion, provided that the Administrative Agent shall from time to time 
upon the request of the Collateral Agent,

34

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

charge the Loan Account of the Borrower with any amount due and payable 
under any Loan Document. Whenever any payment to be made under any such 
Loan Document shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, 
such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and such 
extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of 
interest or fees, as the case may be. All computations of fees shall be 
made by the Administrative Agent on the basis of a year of 360 days for the 
actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day) 
occurring in the period for which such fees are payable. Each determination 
by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fees hereunder shall be 
conclusive and binding for all purposes in the absence of manifest error. 
The Administrative Agent shall provide the Borrower, promptly after the end 
of each calendar month, a summary statement (in the form from time to time 
used by the Administrative Agent) of the opening and closing daily balances 
in the Loan Account of the Borrower during such month, the amounts and 
dates of all Loans made to the Borrower during such month, the amounts and 
dates of all payments on account of the Loans to the Borrower during such 
month and the Loans to which such payments were applied, the amount of 
interest accrued on the Loans to the Borrower during such month, and the 
amount and nature of any charges to the Loan Account made during such month 
on account of fees, commissions, expenses and other Obligations. All 
entries on any such statement shall be presumed to be correct and, thirty 
(30) days after the same is sent, shall be final and conclusive absent 
manifest error.

          Section 4.02 Sharing of Payments, Etc. Except as provided in 
Section 2.02 hereof, if any Lender shall obtain any payment (whether 
voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set-off, or 
otherwise) on account of any Obligation in excess of its ratable share of 
payments on account of similar obligations obtained by all the Lenders, 
such Lender shall forthwith purchase from the other Lenders such 
participations in such similar obligations held by them as shall be 
necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment 
ratably with each of them; provided, however, that if all or any portion of 
such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, 
such purchase from each Lender shall be rescinded and such Lender shall 
repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price to the extent of such 
recovery together with an amount equal to such Lenders ratable share 
(according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Lenders required 
repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender 
of any interest or other amount paid by the purchasing Lender in respect of 
the total amount so recovered). The Borrower agrees that any Lender so 
purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to this Section 
4.02 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all of its 
rights (including the Lenders right of set-off) with respect to such 
participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the 
Borrower in the amount of such participation.

          Section 4.03 Apportionment of Payments. Subject to Section 2.02 
hereof:all payments of principal and interest in respect of outstanding 
Loans, all payments of fees and all other payments in respect of any other 
Obligations, shall be allocated by the Administrative Agent among such of 
the Lenders as are entitled thereto, in proportion to their respective Pro 
Rata Shares or otherwise as provided herein or, in respect of payments not 
made on account of Loans, as designated by the Person making payment when 
the payment is made.

               (b) After the occurrence and during the continuance of a 
Default or an Event of Default, the Administrative Agent may, and upon the 
direction of the Required Lenders

35

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

shall, apply all proceeds of the Collateral (including all Collections 
other than Salvage Collections), subject to the provisions of this 
Agreement, (i) first, to pay the Servicer an amount equal to the accrued 
and unpaid Servicing Fees then due and payable in accordance with the 
Transaction Documents until paid in full; (ii) second, to pay the 
Obligations in respect of any fees, expense reimbursements, indemnities and 
other amounts then due and payable to the Agents until paid in full; (iii) 
third, to pay the Insurance Collateral Agent an amount equal to any fees, 
expense reimbursements, indemnities and other amounts then due and payable 
to the Insurance Collateral Agent in accordance with the Transaction 
Documents until paid in full; (iv) fourth, to pay the Obligations in 
respect of any fees, expense reimbursements, indemnities and other amounts 
then due and payable to the Lenders until paid in full; (v) fifth, to pay 
interest then due and payable in respect of the Collateral Agent Advances 
until paid in full; (vi) sixth, to pay principal of the Collateral Agent 
Advances until paid in full, (vii) seventh, to pay interest then due and 
payable in respect of the Loans until paid in full, (viii) eighth, to pay 
principal of the Loans until paid in full, (ix) ninth, to the payment of 
all other Obligations then due and payable, and (x) tenth, any remaining 
Collections on such date shall be paid to the Borrower, for its own 
account.

               (c) In each instance, so long as no Event of Default has 
occurred and is continuing, Section 4.03(b) shall not be deemed to apply to 
any payment by the Borrower specified by the Borrower to the Administrative 
Agent to be for the payment of the Obligations then due and payable under 
any provision of this Agreement or the prepayment of all or part of the 
principal of the Term Loan in accordance with the terms and conditions of 
Section 2.05.

               (d) For purposes of Section 4.03(b), paid in full means 
payment in cash of all amounts owing under the Loan Documents and the 
Transaction Documents according to the terms thereof, including loan fees, 
servicing fees, professional fees, interest (and specifically including 
interest accrued after the commencement of any Insolvency Proceeding), 
default interest, interest on interest, and expense reimbursements, whether 
or not same would be or is allowed or disallowed in whole or in part in any 
Insolvency Proceeding.

               (e) In the event of a direct conflict between the priority 
provisions of this Section 4.03 and other provisions contained in any other 
Loan Document, it is the intention of the parties hereto that both such 
priority provisions in such documents shall be read together and construed, 
to the fullest extent possible, to be in concert with each other. In the 
event of any actual, irreconcilable conflict that cannot be resolved as 
aforesaid, the terms and provisions of this Section 4.03 shall control and 
govern.

          Section 4.04 Increased Costs and Reduced Return. (a) If any 
Lender or any Agent shall have determined that the adoption or 
implementation of, or any change in, any law, rule, treaty or regulation, 
or any policy, guideline or directive of, or any change in, the 
interpretation or administration thereof by, any court, central bank or 
other administrative or Governmental Authority, or compliance by any Lender 
or any Agent or any Person controlling any such Agent or any such Lender 
with any directive of, or guideline from, any central bank or other 
Governmental Authority or the introduction of, or change in, any accounting 
principles applicable to any Lender or any Agent or any Person controlling 
any such Agent or any such Lender (in each case, whether or not having the 
force of law) (each a Change in Law), shall (i) subject such Agent or 
such Lender, or any Person controlling such Agent or such Lender to any

36

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

tax, duty or other charge with respect to this Agreement or any Loan made 
by such Agent or such Lender, or change the basis of taxation of payments 
to such Agent or such Lender or any Person controlling such Agent or such 
Lender of any amounts payable hereunder (except for taxes on the overall 
net income of such Agent or such Lender or any Person controlling such 
Agent or such Lender), (ii) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, 
special deposit or similar requirement against any Loan or against assets 
of or held by, or deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended 
by, such Agent or such Lender or any Person controlling such Agent or such 
Lender or (iii) impose on such Agent or such Lender or any Person 
controlling such Agent or such Lender any other condition regarding this 
Agreement or any Loan, and the result of any event referred to in clauses 
(i), (ii) or (iii) above shall be to increase the cost to such Agent or 
such Lender of making any Loan or agreeing to make any Loan or to reduce 
any amount received or receivable by such Agent or such Lender hereunder, 
then, upon demand by such Agent or such Lender, the Borrower shall pay to 
such Agent or such Lender such additional amounts as will compensate such 
Agent or such Lender for such increased costs or reductions in amount.

               (b) If any Agent or any Lender shall have determined that 
any Change in Law either (i) affects or would affect the amount of capital 
required or expected to be maintained by such Agent or such Lender or any 
Person controlling such Agent or such Lender, and such Agent or such Lender 
determines that the amount of such capital is increased as a direct or 
indirect consequence of any Loans made or maintained, such Agents or such 
Lenders or such other controlling Persons other obligations hereunder, or 
(ii) has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such 
Agents or such Lenders such other controlling Persons capital to a level 
below that which such Agent or such Lender or such controlling Person could 
have achieved but for such circumstances as a consequence of any Loans made 
or maintained or any agreement to make Loans or such Agents or such 
Lenders or such other controlling Persons other obligations hereunder (in 
each case, taking into consideration, such Agents or such Lenders or such 
other controlling Persons policies with respect to capital adequacy), 
then, upon demand by such Agent or such Lender, the Borrower shall pay to 
such Agent or such Lender from time to time such additional amounts as will 
compensate such Agent or such Lender for such cost of maintaining such 
increased capital or such reduction in the rate of return on such Agents 
or such Lenders or such other controlling Persons capital.

               (c) All amounts payable under this Section 4.04 shall bear 
interest from the date that is ten (10) days after the date of demand by 
any Agent or any Lender until payment in full to such Agent or such Lender 
at the interest rate per annum equal to 20%. A certificate of such Agent or 
such Lender claiming compensation under this Section 4.04, specifying the 
event herein above described and the nature of such event shall be 
submitted by such Agent or such Lender to the Administrative Borrower, 
setting forth the additional amount due and an explanation of the 
calculation thereof, and such Agents or such Lenders reasons for invoking 
the provisions of this Section 4.04, and shall be final and conclusive 
absent manifest error.

of such Collection Account, the Borrower and such prospective Cash 
Management Bank shall have executed and delivered to the Collateral Agent a 
Cash Management Agreement. The Borrower shall close its Collection Account 
(and establish replacement cash management accounts in accordance with the 
foregoing sentence) promptly and in any event within 30 days of notice from 
the Collateral Agent that the creditworthiness of any Cash Management Bank 
is no longer acceptable in the Collateral Agents reasonable judgment, or 
that the operating performance, funds transfer, or availability procedures 
or performance of such Cash Management Bank with respect to the Collection 
Account or the Collateral Agents liability under any Cash Management 
Agreement with such Cash Management Bank is no longer acceptable in the 
Collateral Agents reasonable judgment.

               (e) The Collection Account shall be a cash collateral 
account, with all cash, checks and similar items of payment in such 
accounts securing payment of the Obligations, and in which the Borrower is 
hereby deemed to have granted a Lien to Collateral Agent for the benefit of 
the Agents and the Lenders. All checks, drafts, notes, money orders, 
acceptances, cash and other evidences of Indebtedness received directly by 
the Borrower from any of the Premium Finance Borrowers or any other Person, 
as proceeds from the Insurance Premium Loans or as

66

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

proceeds of any other Collateral shall be held by the Borrower in trust for 
the Agents and the Lenders and if of a nature susceptible to a deposit in a 
bank account, upon receipt be deposited by the Borrower in original form 
and no later than the next Business Day after receipt thereof into the 
Collection Account; provided, however, all Collections received directly by 
the Borrower shall be held by the Borrower in trust for the Agents and the 
Lenders and upon receipt be deposited by the Borrower in original form and 
no later than the next Business Day after receipt thereof into the 
Administrative Agents Account. The Borrower shall not commingle such 
collections with the proceeds of any assets not included in the Collateral. 
No checks, drafts or other instrument received by the Administrative Agent 
shall constitute final payment to the Administrative Agent unless and until 
such instruments have actually been collected.

               (f) After the occurrence and during the continuance of an 
Event of Default, the Collateral Agent may send a notice of assignment 
and/or notice of the Lenders security interest to any and all Insurance 
Premium Borrowers, the Collateral Value Insurer, the Contingent Collateral 
Value Insurer or third parties holding or otherwise concerned with any of 
the Collateral, and thereafter the Collateral Agent or its designee shall 
have the sole right to collect the Insurance Premium Loans and/or take 
possession of the Collateral and the books and records relating thereto. 
The Borrower shall not, without prior written consent of the Collateral 
Agent, grant any extension of time of payment of any Insurance Premium Loan 
or payments under the Collateral Value Policy or Contingent Collateral 
Value Policy, compromise or settle any Insurance Premium Loan for less than 
the full amount thereof, release, in whole or in part, any Person or 
property liable for the payment thereof, or allow any credit or discount 
whatsoever thereon.

               (g) The Borrower hereby appoints each Agent or its designee 
on behalf of such Agent as the Borrowers attorney-in-fact with power 
exercisable during the continuance of an Event of Default to endorse the 
Borrowers name upon any notes, acceptances, checks, drafts, money orders 
or other evidences of payment relating to the Insurance Premium Loans and 
the Collateral Value Policy and the Contingent Collateral Value Policy, to 
sign the Borrowers name on any invoice or bill of lading relating to any 
of the Insurance Premium Loans, the Collateral Value Policy and the 
Contingent Collateral Value Policy, drafts against Insurance Premium 
Borrowers with respect to Insurance Premium Loans and the Collateral Value 
Policy and the Contingent Collateral Value Policy, assignments and 
verifications of the Insurance Premium Loans, the Collateral Value Policy 
and the Contingent Collateral Value Policy and notices to Insurance Premium 
Borrowers with respect to Insurance Premium Loans and the Collateral Value 
Insurer or Contingent Collateral Value Insurer with respect to the 
Collateral Value Policy or the Contingent Collateral Value Policy, as 
applicable, to send verification of Insurance Premium Loans, the Collateral 
Value Policy and the Contingent Collateral Value Policy, and to notify the 
Postal Service authorities to change the address for delivery of mail 
addressed to the Borrower to such address as such Agent or its designee may 
designate and to do all other acts and things necessary to carry out this 
Agreement. All acts of said attorney or designee are hereby ratified and 
approved, and said attorney or designee shall not be liable for any acts of 
omission or commission (other than acts of omission or commission 
constituting gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a 
final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction), or for any error of 
judgment or mistake of fact or law; this power being coupled with an 
interest is irrevocable until all of the Loans and other Obligations under 
the Loan Documents are paid in full and all of the Loan Documents are 
terminated.

67

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

               (h) Nothing herein contained shall be construed to 
constitute any Agent as agent of the Borrower for any purpose whatsoever, 
and the Agents shall not be responsible or liable for any shortage, 
discrepancy, damage, loss or destruction of any part of the Collateral 
wherever the same may be located and regardless of the cause thereof (other 
than from acts of omission or commission constituting gross negligence or 
willful misconduct as determined by a final judgment of a court of 
competent jurisdiction). The Agents shall not, under any circumstance or in 
any event whatsoever, have any liability for any error or omission or delay 
of any kind occurring in the settlement, collection or payment of any of 
the Insurance Premium Loans or any instrument received in payment thereof 
or for any damage resulting therefrom (other than acts of omission or 
commission constituting gross negligence or willful misconduct as 
determined by a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction). The 
Agents, by anything herein or in any assignment or otherwise, do not assume 
any of the obligations under any contract or agreement assigned to any 
Agent and shall not be responsible in any way for the performance by the 
Borrower of any of the terms and conditions thereof.

               (i) If any Insurance Premium Loan includes a charge for any 
tax payable to any Governmental Authority, each Agent is hereby authorized 
(but in no event obligated) in its discretion to pay the amount thereof to 
the proper taxing authority for the Borrowers account and to charge the 
Borrower therefor. The Borrower shall notify the Agents if any Insurance 
Premium Loan includes any taxes due to any such Governmental Authority and, 
in the absence of such notice, the Agents shall have the right to retain 
the full proceeds of such Insurance Premium Loan and shall not be liable 
for any taxes that may be due by reason of the sale and delivery creating 
such Insurance Premium Loan.

               (j) Notwithstanding any other terms set forth in the Loan 
Documents, the rights and remedies of the Agents and the Lenders herein 
provided, and the obligations of the Borrower set forth herein, are 
cumulative of, may be exercised singly or concurrently with, and are not 
exclusive of, any other rights, remedies or obligations set forth in any 
other Loan Document or as provided by law.

          Section 8.02 Collateral Custodian. Upon the occurrence and during 
the continuance of any Default or Event of Default, the Collateral Agent or 
its designee may at any time and from time to time employ and maintain on 
the premises of the Borrower a custodian selected by the Collateral Agent 
or its designee who shall have full authority to do all acts necessary to 
protect the Agents and the Lenders interests. The Borrower hereby agrees 
to cooperate with any such custodian and to do whatever the Collateral 
Agent or its designee may reasonably request to preserve the Collateral. 
All costs and expenses incurred by the Collateral Agent or its designee by 
reason of the employment of the custodian shall be the responsibility of 
the Borrower and charged to the Loan Account.

instrument relating to such Indebtedness, or any other default under any 
agreement or instrument relating to any such Indebtedness, or any other 
event, shall occur and shall continue after the applicable grace period, if 
any, specified in such agreement or instrument, if the effect of such 
default or event is to accelerate, or to permit the acceleration of, the 
maturity of such Indebtedness; or any such Indebtedness shall be declared 
to be due and payable, or required to be prepaid (other than by a regularly 
scheduled required prepayment), redeemed, purchased or defeased or an offer

duties of each such Agent as set forth in this Agreement including: (i) to 
receive on behalf of each Lender any payment of principal of or interest on 
the Loans outstanding hereunder and all other amounts accrued hereunder for 
the account of the Lenders and paid to such Agent, and, subject to Section 
2.02 of this Agreement, to distribute promptly to each Lender its Pro Rata 
Share of all payments so received; (ii) to distribute to each Lender copies 
of all material notices and agreements received by such Agent and not

the Loans and the Loan Documents and to exercise such other powers 
delegated to such Agent by the terms hereof or the other Loan Documents

notices, waivers, consents, approvals and instructions and the power to 
make or to refuse to make determinations and calculations) together with 
such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto to carry out the purposes 
hereof and thereof. As to any matters not expressly provided for by this 
Agreement and the other Loan Documents (including, without limitation, 
enforcement or collection of the Loans), the Agents shall not be required 
to exercise any discretion or take any action, but shall be required to act 
or to refrain from acting (and shall be fully protected in so acting or

or implied, is intended to or shall be construed to impose upon the Agents 
any obligations in respect of this Agreement or any other Loan Document 
except as expressly set forth herein or therein. Each Lender shall make its 
own independent investigation of the financial condition and affairs of the

Borrower and the value of the Collateral, and the Agents shall have no duty 
or responsibility, either initially or on a continuing basis, to provide 
any Lender with any credit or other information with respect thereto, 
whether coming into their possession before the initial Loan hereunder or 
at any time or times thereafter, provided that, upon the reasonable request 
of a Lender, each Agent shall provide to such Lender any documents or 
reports delivered to such Agent by the Borrower pursuant to the terms of 
this Agreement or any other Loan Document. If any Agent seeks the consent 
or approval of the Required Lenders to the taking or refraining from taking 
any action hereunder, such Agent shall send notice thereof to each Lender. 
Each Agent shall promptly notify each Lender any time that the Required 
Lenders have instructed such Agent to act or refrain from acting pursuant 
hereto.

          Section 10.03 Rights, Exculpation, Etc. The Agents and their 
directors, officers, agents or employees shall not be liable for any action 
taken or omitted to be taken by them under or in connection with this 
Agreement or the other Loan Documents, except for their own gross 
negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a final judgment of a 
court of competent jurisdiction. Without limiting the generality of the 
foregoing, the Agents (i) may treat the payee of any Loan as the owner 
thereof until the Collateral Agent receives written notice of the 
assignment or transfer thereof, pursuant to Section 12.07 hereof, signed by 
such payee and in form satisfactory to the Collateral Agent; (ii) may 
consult with legal counsel (including, without limitation, counsel to any 
Agent or counsel to the Borrower), independent public accountants, and 
other experts selected by any of them and shall not be liable for any 
action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith by any of them in 
accordance with the advice of such counsel or experts; (iii) make no 
warranty or representation to any Lender and shall not be responsible to 
any Lender for any statements, certificates, warranties or representations 
made in or in connection with this Agreement or the other Loan Documents;

ascertain or to inquire as to the performance or observance of any of the 
terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement or the other Loan 
Documents on the part of any Person, the existence or possible existence of 
any Default or Event of Default, or to inspect the Collateral or other 
property (including, without limitation, the books and records) of any 
Person; (v) shall not be responsible to any Lender for the due execution, 
legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of 
this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or any other instrument or 
document furnished pursuant hereto or thereto; and (vi) shall not be deemed 
to have made any representation or warranty regarding the existence, value 
or collectibility of the Collateral, the existence, priority or perfection 
of the Collateral Agents Lien thereon, or any certificate prepared by the 
Borrower in connection therewith, nor shall the Agents be responsible or 
liable to the Lenders for any failure to monitor or maintain any portion of 
the Collateral. The Agents shall not be liable for any apportionment or 
distribution of payments made in good faith pursuant to Section 4.03, and 
if any such apportionment or distribution is subsequently determined to 
have been made in error the sole recourse of any Lender to whom payment was 
due but not made, shall be to recover from other Lenders any payment in 
excess of the amount which they are determined to be entitled. The Agents 
may at any time request instructions from the Lenders with respect to any 
actions or approvals which by the terms of this Agreement or of any of the 
other Loan Documents the Agents are permitted or required to take or to 
grant, and if such instructions are promptly requested, the Agents shall be 
absolutely entitled to refrain from taking any action or to withhold any 
approval under any of the Loan Documents until they shall have received 
such instructions from the Required Lenders. Without limiting the 
foregoing, no Lender shall have any right of action whatsoever against any 
Agent as a result of such Agent acting or refraining from acting under this 
Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents in accordance with the 
instructions of the Required Lenders.

          Section 10.04 Reliance. Each Agent shall be entitled to rely upon 
any written notices, statements, certificates, orders or other documents or 
any telephone message believed by it in good faith to be genuine and 
correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person, and 
with respect to all matters pertaining to this Agreement or any of the 
other Loan Documents and its duties hereunder or thereunder, upon advice of 
counsel selected by it.

          Section 10.05 Indemnification. To the extent that any Agent is 
not reimbursed and indemnified by the Borrower, the Lenders will reimburse 
and indemnify such Agent from and against any and all liabilities, 
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, 
expenses, advances or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which 
may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against such Agent in any way 
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any of the other Loan 
Documents or any action taken or omitted by such Agent under this Agreement 
or any of the other Loan Documents, in proportion to each Lenders Pro Rata 
Share, including, without limitation, advances and disbursements made 
pursuant to Section 10.08; provided, however, that no Lender shall be 
liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, 
penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses, advances or 
disbursements for which there has been a final judicial determination that 
such liability resulted from such Agents gross negligence or willful 
misconduct. The obligations of the Lenders under this Section 10.05 shall 
survive the payment in full of the Loans and the termination of this 
Agreement.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

          Section 10.06 Agents Individually. With respect to its Pro Rata 
Share of the Total Commitment hereunder and the Loans made by it, each 
Agent shall have and may exercise the same rights and powers hereunder and 
is subject to the same obligations and liabilities as and to the extent set 
forth herein for any other Lender or maker of a Loan. The terms Lenders 
or Required Lenders or any similar terms shall, unless the context 
clearly otherwise indicates, include each Agent in its individual capacity 
as a Lender or one of the Required Lenders. Each Agent and its Affiliates 
may accept deposits from, lend money to, and generally engage in any kind 
of banking, trust or other business with the Borrower as if it were not 
acting as an Agent pursuant hereto without any duty to account to the other 
Lenders.

          Section 10.07 Successor Agent. (a) (i) Each Agent may resign from 
the performance of all its functions and duties hereunder and under the 
other Loan Documents at any time by giving at least ten (10) Business Days 
prior written notice to the Borrower and each Lender, and (ii) on or after 
the Term Loan Commitment Termination Date, the Required Funded Lenders may 
remove each Agent without cause at any time by giving at least five (5) 
Business Days prior written notice to such Agent, the Borrower and each 
other Lender. Such resignation or removal shall take effect upon the 
acceptance by a successor Agent of appointment pursuant to clauses (b) and 
(c) below or as otherwise provided below.

               (b) Upon any such notice of resignation or removal, the 
Required Lenders (or the Required Funded Lenders in the case of a removal 
under clause (ii) of paragraph (a) of this Section 10.07) shall appoint a 
successor Agent. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Agent hereunder 
by a successor Agent, such successor Agent shall thereupon succeed to and 
become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the 
retiring Agent, and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties 
and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. After 
any Agents resignation or removal hereunder as an Agent, the provisions of 
this Article X shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or 
omitted to be taken by it while it was an Agent under this Agreement and 
the other Loan Documents.

               (c) If a successor Agent shall not have been so appointed 
within said ten (10) Business Day period, the retiring Agent, with the 
consent of the other Agent shall then appoint a successor Agent who shall 
serve as an Agent until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders, with 
the consent of the other Agent, appoint a successor Agent as provided 
above.

          Section 10.08 Collateral Matters.

               (a) The Collateral Agent may from time to time on or after 
the Term Loan Commitment Termination Date make such disbursements and 
advances (Collateral Agent Advances) which the Collateral Agent, in its 
sole discretion, deems necessary or desirable to preserve, protect, prepare 
for sale or lease or dispose of the Collateral or any portion thereof, to 
enhance the likelihood or maximize the amount of repayment by the Borrower 
of the Loans and other Obligations or to pay any other amount chargeable to 
the Borrower pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, including, without 
limitation, costs, fees and expenses as described in Section 12.04. Without 
limiting the foregoing, the Collateral Agent shall be permitted at anytime 
to make Collateral Agent Advances to pay insurance premiums due under the 
Life Insurance Policies. The Collateral Agent Advances shall be repayable 
on demand and be secured by the Collateral. The Collateral Agent Advances 
shall constitute Obligations hereunder which may be

76

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

charged to the Loan Account in accordance with Section 4.01. The Collateral 
Agent shall notify each Lender and the Borrower in writing of each such 
Collateral Agent Advance, which notice shall include a description of the 
purpose of such Collateral Agent Advance. Without limitation to its 
obligations pursuant to Section 10.05, each Lender agrees that it shall 
make available to the Collateral Agent, upon the Collateral Agents demand, 
in Dollars in immediately available funds, the amount equal to such 
Lenders Pro Rata Share of each such Collateral Agent Advance. If such 
funds are not made available to the Collateral Agent by such Lender, the 
Collateral Agent shall be entitled to recover such funds on demand from 
such Lender, together with interest thereon for each day from the date such 
payment was due until the date such amount is paid to the Collateral Agent, 
at the Federal Funds Rate for three Business Days and thereafter at the 
interest rate per annum equal to 20%.

               (b) The Lenders hereby irrevocably authorize the Collateral 
Agent, at its option and in its discretion, to release any Lien granted to 
or held by the Collateral Agent upon any Collateral upon termination of the 
Total Commitment and payment and satisfaction of all Loans, Reimbursement 
Obligations, Letter of Credit Obligations, and all other Obligations in 
accordance with the terms hereof; or constituting property being sold or 
disposed of in the ordinary course of the Borrowers business or otherwise 
in compliance with the terms of this Agreement and the other Loan 
Documents; or constituting property in which the Borrower owned no interest 
at the time the Lien was granted or at any time thereafter; or if approved, 
authorized or ratified in writing by the Lenders. Upon request by the 
Collateral Agent at any time, the Lenders will confirm in writing the 
Collateral Agents authority to release particular types or items of 
Collateral pursuant to this Section 10.08(b).

               (c) Without in any manner limiting the Collateral Agents 
authority to act without any specific or further authorization or consent 
by the Lenders (as set forth in Section 10.08(b)), each Lender agrees to 
confirm in writing, upon request by the Collateral Agent, the authority to 
release Collateral conferred upon the Collateral Agent under Section 
10.08(b). Upon receipt by the Collateral Agent of confirmation from the 
Lenders of its authority to release any particular item or types of 
Collateral, and upon prior written request by the Borrower, the Collateral 
Agent shall (and is hereby irrevocably authorized by the Lenders to) 
execute such documents as may be necessary to evidence the release of the 
Liens granted to the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Agents and the 
Lenders upon such Collateral; provided, however, that (i) the Collateral 
Agent shall not be required to execute any such document on terms which, in 
the Collateral Agents opinion, would expose the Collateral Agent to 
liability or create any obligations or entail any consequence other than 
the release of such Liens without recourse or warranty, and (ii) such 
release shall not in any manner discharge, affect or impair the Obligations 
or any Lien upon (or obligations of the Borrower in respect of) all 
interests in the Collateral retained by the Borrower.

               (d) The Collateral Agent shall have no obligation whatsoever 
to any Lender to assure that the Collateral exists or is owned by the 
Borrower or is cared for, protected or insured or has been encumbered or 
that the Lien granted to the Collateral Agent pursuant to this Agreement or 
any other Loan Document has been properly or sufficiently or lawfully 
created, perfected, protected or enforced or is entitled to any particular 
priority, or to exercise at all or in any particular manner or under any 
duty of care, disclosure or fidelity, or to continue exercising, any of the 
rights, authorities and powers granted or available to the Collateral Agent

77

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

in this Section 10.08 or in any other Loan Document, it being understood 
and agreed that in respect of the Collateral, or any act, omission or event 
related thereto, the Collateral Agent may act in any manner it may deem 
appropriate, in its sole discretion, given the Collateral Agents own 
interest in the Collateral as one of the Lenders and that the Collateral 
Agent shall have no duty or liability whatsoever to any other Lender, 
except as otherwise provided herein.

          Section 10.09 Agency for Perfection. Each Agent and each Lender 
hereby appoints each other Agent and each other Lender as agent and bailee 
for the purpose of perfecting the security interests in and liens upon the 
Collateral in assets which, in accordance with Article 9 of the Uniform 
Commercial Code, can be perfected only by possession or control (or where 
the security interest of a secured party with possession or control has 
priority over the security interest of another secured party) and each 
Agent and each Lender hereby acknowledges that it holds possession of or 
otherwise controls any such Collateral for the benefit of the Agents and 
the Lenders as secured party. Should the Administrative Agent or any Lender 
obtain possession or control of any such Collateral, the Administrative 
Agent or such Lender shall notify the Collateral Agent thereof, and, 
promptly upon the Collateral Agents request therefor shall deliver such 
Collateral to the Collateral Agent or in accordance with the Collateral 
Agents instructions. In addition, the Collateral Agent shall also have the 
power and authority hereunder to appoint such other sub-agents as may be 
necessary or required under applicable state law or otherwise to perform 
its duties and enforce its rights with respect to the Collateral and under 
the Loan Documents. The Borrower by its execution and delivery of this 
Agreement hereby consents to the foregoing.

          Section 10.10 No Reliance on any Agents Customer Identification 
Program. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that neither such Lender, nor 
any of its Affiliates, participants or assignees, may rely on any Agent to 
carry out such Lenders, Affiliates, participants or assignees customer 
identification program, or other obligations required or imposed under or 
pursuant to the USA PATRIOT Act or the regulations thereunder, including 
the regulations contained in 31 CFR 103.121 (as hereafter amended or 
replaced, the CIP Regulations), or any other Anti-Terrorism Law, 
including any programs involving any of the following items relating to or 
in connection with the Borrower, their Affiliates or their agents, the Loan 
Documents or the transactions hereunder or contemplated hereby: (1) any 
identity verification procedures, (2) any recordkeeping, (3) comparisons 
with government lists, (4) customer notices or (5) other procedures 
required under the CIP Regulations or such other laws. Each Lender, 
Affiliate, participant or assignee subject to Section 326 of the USA 
PATRIOT Act will perform the measures necessary to satisfy its own 
responsibilities under the CIP Regulations.

provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, and no consent to 
any departure by the Borrower therefrom, shall in any event be effective

amendment, waiver or consent shall (i) increase the Commitment of any 
Lender, reduce the principal of, or interest on, the Loans payable to any 
Lender, reduce the amount of any fee payable for the account of any Lender, 
or postpone or extend any scheduled date fixed for any payment of principal 
of, or interest or fees on, the Loans payable to any Lender, in each case 
without the written consent of any Lender affected thereby, (ii) increase 
the Total Commitment without the written consent of each Lender, (iii)

duties of such Agent (but not in its capacity as a Lender) under this 
Agreement or the other Loan Documents. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the

or consent with respect to the definitions of Collateral Value Insurer, 
Collateral Value Policy, Collections, Coverage Certificate, Person

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

beneficiary solely with respect to Section 2.05(e), Section 12.19 and the 
last three sentences in Section 12.02(a) of this Agreement

          (b) If any action to be taken by the Lenders hereunder requires 
the unanimous consent, authorization, or agreement of all of the Lenders, 
and a Lender other than the Collateral Agent and the Administrative Agent 
(the Holdout Lender) fails to give its consent, authorization, or 
agreement, then the Collateral Agent, upon at least 5 Business Days prior 
irrevocable notice to the Holdout Lender, may permanently replace the 
Holdout Lender with one or more substitute Lenders (each, a Replacement 
Lender), and the Holdout Lender shall have no right to refuse to be 
replaced hereunder. Such notice to replace the Holdout Lender shall specify 
an effective date for such replacement, which date shall not be later than 
15 Business Days after the date such notice is given. Prior to the 
effective date of such replacement, the Holdout Lender and each Replacement 
Lender shall execute and deliver an Assignment and Acceptance, subject only 
to the Holdout Lender being repaid its share of the outstanding Obligations 
without any premium or penalty of any kind whatsoever. If the Holdout 
Lender shall refuse or fail to execute and deliver any such Assignment and 
Acceptance prior to the effective date of such replacement, the Holdout 
Lender shall be deemed to have executed and delivered such Assignment and 
Acceptance. The replacement of any Holdout Lender shall be made in 
accordance with the terms of Section 12.07(b). Until such time as the 
Replacement Lenders shall have acquired all of the Obligations, the 
Commitments, and the other rights and obligations of the Holdout Lender 
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the Holdout Lender shall 
remain obligated to make its Pro Rata Share of Loans.

          Section 12.03 No Waiver; Remedies, Etc. No failure on the part of 
any Agent or any Lender to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right 
hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver 
thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right under any 
Loan Document preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the 
exercise of any other right. The rights and remedies of the Agents and the 
Lenders provided herein and in the other Loan Documents are cumulative and 
are in addition to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies provided 
by law. The rights of the Agents and the Lenders under any Loan Document 
against any party thereto are not conditional or contingent on any attempt 
by the Agents and the Lenders to exercise any of their rights under any 
other Loan Document against such party or against any other Person.

          Section 12.04 Expenses; Taxes; Attorneys Fees. The Borrower will

Agent (and, in the case of clauses (b) through (m) below, each Lender),

expenses of counsel for each Agent (and, in the case of clauses (b) through 
(m) below, each Lender), accounting, due diligence, periodic field audits,

monitoring of assets, appraisals of Collateral and title searches, 
miscellaneous disbursements, examination, travel, lodging and meals,

Loan Documents (including, without limitation, the preparation of any 
additional Loan Documents pursuant to Section 7.01(b) or the review of any 
of the agreements, instruments and documents referred to in Section 
7.01(f)), (b) any requested amendments, waivers or consents to this 
Agreement or the other Loan Documents

81

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

whether or not such documents become effective or are given, (c) the 
preservation and protection of the Agents or any of the Lenders rights 
under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, (d) the defense of any 
claim or action asserted or brought against any Agent or any Lender by any 
Person that arises from or relates to this Agreement, any other Loan 
Document, the Agents or the Lenders claims against the Borrower, or any 
and all matters in connection therewith, (e) the commencement or defense 
of, or intervention in, any court proceeding arising from or related to 
this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (f) the filing of any petition, 
complaint, answer, motion or other pleading by any Agent or any Lender, or 
the taking of any action in respect of the Collateral or other security, in 
connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (g) the 
protection, collection, lease, sale, taking possession of or liquidation 
of, any Collateral or other security in connection with this Agreement or 
any other Loan Document, (h) any attempt to enforce any Lien or security 
interest in any Collateral or other security in connection with this 
Agreement or any other Loan Document, (i) any attempt to collect from the 
Borrower, or (i) the receipt by any Agent or any Lender of any advice from 
professionals with respect to any of the foregoing. Without limitation of 
the foregoing or any other provision of any Loan Document: (x) the Borrower 
agrees to pay all stamp, document, transfer, recording or filing taxes or 
fees and similar impositions now or hereafter determined by any Agent or 
any Lender to be payable in connection with this Agreement or any other 
Loan Document, and the Borrower agrees to save each Agent and each Lender 
harmless from and against any and all present or future claims, liabilities 
or losses with respect to or resulting from any omission to pay or delay in 
paying any such taxes, fees or impositions, (y) the Borrower agrees to pay 
all broker fees that may become due in connection with the transactions 
contemplated by this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and (z) if the 
Borrower fails to perform any covenant or agreement contained herein or in 
any other Loan Document, any Agent may itself perform or cause performance 
of such covenant or agreement, and the expenses of such Agent incurred in 
connection therewith shall be reimbursed on demand by the Borrower.

          Section 12.05 Right of Set-off. Upon the occurrence and during 
the continuance of any Event of Default, any Agent or any Lender may, and 
is hereby authorized to, at any time and from time to time, without notice 
to the Borrower (any such notice being expressly waived by the Borrower) 
and to the fullest extent permitted by law, set off and apply any and all 
deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any 
time held and other Indebtedness at any time owing by such Agent or such 
Lender to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower against any and 
all obligations of the Borrower either now or hereafter existing under any 
Loan Document, irrespective of whether or not such Agent or such Lender 
shall have made any demand hereunder or thereunder and although such 
obligations may be contingent or unmatured. Each Agent and each Lender 
agrees to notify the Borrower promptly after any such set-off and 
application made by such Agent or such Lender provided that the failure to 
give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and 
application. The rights of the Agents and the Lenders under this Section 
12.05 are in addition to the other rights and remedies (including other 
rights of set-off) which the Agents and the Lenders may have under this 
Agreement or any other Loan Documents of law or otherwise.

          Section 12.06 Severability. Any provision of this Agreement which 
is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such 
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or 
unenforceability without invalidating the remaining portions hereof or 
affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other 
jurisdiction.

          Section 12.07 Assignments and Participations.

               (a) This Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be 
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Borrower and each Agent and 
each Lender and their respective successors and assigns; provided, however
, that Borrower may not assign or transfer any of its rights hereunder or 
under the other Loan Documents without the prior written consent of each 
Lender and any such assignment without the Lenders prior written consent 
shall be null and void.

               (b) Each Lender may with the written consent of the 
Collateral Agent, assign to one or more other lenders or other entities all 
or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement with 
respect to all or a portion of its Term Loan Commitment and any Term Loan 
made by it and; provided, however, that (i) such assignment is in an amount 
which is at least $1,000,000 (or the remainder of such Lenders 
Commitment), (ii) that the parties to each such assignment shall execute 
and deliver to the Collateral Agent an Assignment and Acceptance, together 
with any promissory note subject to such assignment. Upon such execution, 
delivery and acceptance, from and after the effective date specified in 
each Assignment and Acceptance and recordation on the Register, (A) the 
assignee thereunder shall become a Lender hereunder and, in addition to 
the rights and obligations hereunder held by it immediately prior to such 
effective date, have the rights and obligations hereunder that have been

assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent that rights and 
obligations hereunder have been assigned by it pursuant to such Assignment 
and Acceptance, relinquish its rights and be released from its obligations 
under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance 
covering all or the remaining portion of an assigning Lenders rights and 
obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party 
hereto).

               (c) By executing and delivering an Assignment and 
Acceptance, the assigning Lender and the assignee thereunder confirm to and 
agree with each other and the other parties hereto as follows: (i) other 
than as provided in such Assignment and Acceptance, the assigning Lender 
makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with 
respect to any statements, warranties or representations made in or in 
connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the execution, 
legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of 
this Agreement or any other Loan Document furnished pursuant hereto; (ii) 
the assigning Lender makes no representation or warranty and assumes no 
responsibility with respect to the financial condition of the Borrower or 
the performance or observance by the Borrower of any of its obligations 
under this Agreement or any other Loan Document furnished pursuant hereto; 
(iii) such assignee confirms that it has received a copy of this Agreement 
and the other Loan Documents, together with such other documents and 
information it has deemed appropriate to make its own credit analysis and 
decision to enter into such Assignment and Acceptance; (iv) such assignee 
will, independently and without reliance upon the assigning Lender, any 
Agent or any Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall 
deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in 
taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan 
Documents; (v) such assignee appoints and authorizes the Agents to take 
such action as agents on its behalf and to exercise such powers under this 
Agreement and the other Loan Documents as are delegated to the Agents by 
the terms hereof and thereof, together with such powers as are reasonably

83

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

incidental hereto and thereto; and (vi) such assignee agrees that it will 
perform in accordance with their terms all of the obligations which by the 
terms of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents are required to be 
performed by it as a Lender.

               (d) The Administrative Agent shall, acting solely for this 
purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain, or cause to be 
maintained at the Payment Office, a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance 
delivered to and accepted by it and a register (the Register) for the 
recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders and the Commitments 
of, and the principal amount of the Loans (and stated interest thereon) 
(the Registered Loans). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive 
and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the 
Agents and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the 
Register as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement. The 
Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower and any Lender 
at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

               (e) Upon receipt by the Administrative Agent of a completed 
Assignment and Acceptance, the Administrative Agent shall accept such 
assignment and record the information contained therein in the Register.

               (f) A Registered Loan (and the registered note, if any, 
evidencing the same) may be assigned or sold in whole or in part only by 
registration of such assignment or sale on the Register (and each 
registered note shall expressly so provide). Any assignment or sale of all 
or part of such Registered Loan (and the registered note, if any, 
evidencing the same) may be effected only by registration of such 
assignment or sale on the Register, together with the surrender of the 
registered note, if any, evidencing the same duly endorsed by (or 
accompanied by a written instrument of assignment or sale duly executed by) 
the holder of such registered note, whereupon, at the request of the 
designated assignee(s) or transferee(s), one or more new registered notes 
in the same aggregate principal amount shall be issued to the designated 
assignee(s) or transferee(s). Prior to the registration of assignment or 
sale of any Registered Loan (and the registered note, if any, evidencing 
the same), the Agents shall treat the Person in whose name such Registered 
Loan (and the registered note, if any, evidencing the same) is registered 
on the Register as the owner thereof for the purpose of receiving all 
payments thereon, notwithstanding notice to the contrary.

               (g) In the event that any Lender sells participations in a 
Registered Loan, such Lender shall, acting for this purpose as a 
non-fiduciary agent on behalf of the Borrower, maintain, or cause to be 
maintained, a register on which it enters the name of all participants in 
the Registered Loans held by it and the principal amount (and stated 
interest thereon) of the portion of the Registered Loan that is the subject 
of the participation (the Participant Register). A Registered Loan (and 
the registered note, if any, evidencing the same) may be participated in 
whole or in part only by registration of such participation on the 
Participant Register (and each registered note shall expressly so provide). 
Any participation of such Registered Loan (and the registered note, if any, 
evidencing the same) may be effected only by the registration of such 
participation on the Participant Register. The Participant Register shall 
be available for inspection by the Borrower and any Lender at any 
reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

84

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

               (h) Any Non-U. S. Lender who purchases or is assigned or 
participates in any portion of such Registered Loan shall comply with 
Section 2.08(d).

               (i) Each Lender may sell participations to one or more banks 
or other entities in or to all or a portion of its rights and obligations 
under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents (including, without 
limitation, all or a portion of its Commitments, the Loans made by it); 
provided, that (i) such Lenders obligations under this Agreement 
(including without limitation, its Commitments hereunder) and the other 
Loan Documents shall remain unchanged; (ii) such Lender shall remain solely 
responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such 
obligations, and the Borrower, the Agents and the other Lenders shall 
continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with 
such Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other 
Loan Documents; and (iii) a participant shall not be entitled to require 
such Lender to take or omit to take any action hereunder except (A) action 
directly effecting an extension of the maturity dates or decrease in the 
principal amount of the Loans, (B) action directly effecting an extension 
of the due dates or a decrease in the rate of interest payable on the Loans 
or the fees payable under this Agreement, or (C) actions directly effecting 
a release of all or a substantial portion of the Collateral or the Borrower 
(except as set forth in Section 10.08 of this Agreement or any other Loan 
Document). The Borrower agrees that each participant shall be entitled to 
the benefits of Section 2.08 and Section 4.04 of this Agreement with 
respect to its participation in any portion of the Commitments and the 
Loans as if it was a Lender.

          Section 12.08 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any 
number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate 
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of 
which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery 
of an executed counterpart of this Agreement by telefacsimile or electronic 
mail shall be equally as effective as delivery of an original executed 
counterpart of this Agreement. Any party delivering an executed counterpart 
of this Agreement by telefacsimile or electronic mail also shall deliver an 
original executed counterpart of this Agreement but the failure to deliver 
an original executed counterpart shall not affect the validity, 
enforceability, and binding effect of this Agreement. The foregoing shall 
apply to each other Loan Document mutatis mutandis.

          Section 12.09 GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN 
DOCUMENTS (UNLESS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED TO THE CONTRARY IN ANOTHER LOAN 
DOCUMENT IN RESPECT OF SUCH OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT) SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND 
CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK APPLICABLE 
TO CONTRACTS MADE AND TO BE PERFORMED IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

          Section 12.10 CONSENT TO JURISDICTION; SERVICE OF PROCESS AND 
VENUE. ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY 
OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT MAY BE BROUGHT IN THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK 
IN THE COUNTY OF NEW YORK OR OF THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK, AND, BY EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF THIS 
AGREEMENT, THE BORROWER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY ACCEPTS IN RESPECT OF ITS 
PROPERTY, GENERALLY

85

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

AND UNCONDITIONALLY, THE JURISDICTION OF THE AFORESAID COURTS. THE BORROWER 
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY APPOINTS THE SECRETARY OF STATE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK 
AS ITS AGENT FOR SERVICE OF PROCESS IN RESPECT OF ANY SUCH ACTION OR 
PROCEEDING AND FURTHER IRREVOCABLY CONSENTS TO THE SERVICE OF PROCESS OUT 
OF ANY OF THE AFOREMENTIONED COURTS AND IN ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING BY 
THE MAILING OF COPIES THEREOF BY REGISTERED OR CERTIFIED MAIL, POSTAGE 
PREPAID, TO THE BORROWER AT ITS ADDRESS FOR NOTICES AS SET FORTH IN SECTION 
12.01 AND TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, SUCH SERVICE 
TO BECOME EFFECTIVE TEN (10) DAYS AFTER SUCH MAILING. THE BORROWER AGREES 
THAT A FINAL JUDGMENT IN ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING SHALL BE CONCLUSIVE 
AND MAY BE ENFORCED IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS BY SUIT ON THE JUDGMENT OR IN 
ANY OTHER MANNER PROVIDED BY LAW. NOTHING HEREIN SHALL AFFECT THE RIGHT OF 
THE AGENTS AND THE LENDERS TO SERVICE OF PROCESS IN ANY OTHER MANNER 
PERMITTED BY LAW OR TO COMMENCE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS OR OTHERWISE PROCEED 
AGAINST THE BORROWER IN ANY OTHER JURISDICTION. THE BORROWER HEREBY 
EXPRESSLY AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, 
ANY OBJECTION WHICH IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE JURISDICTION OR 
LAYING OF VENUE OF ANY SUCH LITIGATION BROUGHT IN ANY SUCH COURT REFERRED 
TO ABOVE AND ANY CLAIM THAT ANY SUCH LITIGATION HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN AN 
INCONVENIENT FORUM. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE BORROWER HAS OR HEREAFTER MAY 
ACQUIRE ANY IMMUNITY FROM JURISDICTION OF ANY COURT OR FROM ANY LEGAL 
PROCESS (WHETHER THROUGH SERVICE OR NOTICE, ATTACHMENT PRIOR TO JUDGMENT, 
ATTACHMENT IN AID OF EXECUTION OR OTHERWISE) WITH RESPECT TO ITSELF OR ITS 
PROPERTY, THE BORROWER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES SUCH IMMUNITY IN RESPECT 
OF ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS.

          Section 12.11 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL, ETC. THE BORROWER, EACH AGENT 
AND EACH LENDER HEREBY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, 
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM CONCERNING ANY RIGHTS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR 
THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS, OR UNDER ANY AMENDMENT, WAIVER, CONSENT, 
INSTRUMENT, DOCUMENT OR OTHER AGREEMENT DELIVERED OR WHICH IN THE FUTURE 
MAY BE DELIVERED IN CONNECTION THEREWITH, OR ARISING FROM ANY FINANCING 
RELATIONSHIP EXISTING IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, AND AGREES THAT 
ANY SUCH ACTION, PROCEEDINGS OR COUNTERCLAIM SHALL BE TRIED BEFORE A COURT 
AND NOT BEFORE A JURY. THE BORROWER CERTIFIES THAT NO OFFICER, 
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY AGENT OR ANY LENDER HAS 
REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT ANY AGENT OR ANY LENDER WOULD 
NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM, SEEK TO 
ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVERS. THE BORROWER HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THIS 
PROVISION IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT FOR THE AGENTS AND THE LENDERS ENTERING 
INTO THIS AGREEMENT.

86

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

          Section 12.12 Consent by the Agents and Lenders. Except as 
otherwise expressly set forth herein to the contrary or in any other Loan 
Document, if the consent, approval, satisfaction, determination, judgment, 
acceptance or similar action (an Action) of any Agent or any Lender shall 
be permitted or required pursuant to any provision hereof or any provision 
of any other agreement to which the Borrower is a party and to which any 
Agent or any Lender has succeeded thereto, such Action shall be required to 
be in writing and may be withheld or denied by such Agent or such Lender, 
in its sole discretion, with or without any reason, and without being 
subject to question or challenge on the grounds that such Action was not 
taken in good faith.

          Section 12.13 No Party Deemed Drafter. Each of the parties hereto 
agrees that no party hereto shall be deemed to be the drafter of this 
Agreement.

          Section 12.14 Reinstatement; Certain Payments. If any claim is 
ever made upon any Agent or any Lender for repayment or recovery of any 
amount or amounts received by such Agent or such Lender in payment or on 
account of any of the Obligations, such Agent or such Lender shall give 
prompt notice of such claim to each other Agent and Lender and the 
Borrower, and if such Agent or such Lender repays all or part of such 
amount by reason of (i) any judgment, decree or order of any court or 
administrative body having jurisdiction over such Agent or such Lender or 
any of its property, or (ii) any good faith settlement or compromise of any 
such claim effected by such Agent or such Lender with any such claimant, 
then and in such event the Borrower agrees that (A) any such judgment, 
decree, order, settlement or compromise shall be binding upon it 
notwithstanding the cancellation of any Indebtedness hereunder or under the 
other Loan Documents or the termination of this Agreement or the other Loan 
Documents, and (B) it shall be and remain liable to such Agent or such 
Lender hereunder for the amount so repaid or recovered to the same extent 
as if such amount had never originally been received by such Agent or such 
Lender.

          Section 12.15 Indemnification.

               (a) General Indemnity. In addition to the Borrowers other 
Obligations under this Agreement, the Borrower agrees to, jointly and 
severally, defend, protect, indemnify and hold harmless each Agent, each 
Lender and all of their respective officers, directors, employees, 
attorneys, consultants and agents (collectively called the Indemnitees) 
from and against any and all losses, damages, liabilities, obligations, 
penalties, fees, reasonable costs and expenses (including, without 
limitation, reasonable attorneys fees, costs and expenses) incurred by 
such Indemnitees, whether prior to or from and after the Effective Date, 
whether direct, indirect or consequential, as a result of or arising from 
or relating to or in connection with any of the following: (i) the 
negotiation, preparation, execution or performance or enforcement of this 
Agreement, any other Loan Document or of any other document executed in 
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) any 
Agents or any Lenders furnishing of funds to the Borrower for the account 
of the Borrower under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, 
including, without limitation, the management of any such Loans, (iii) any 
matter relating to the financing transactions contemplated by this 
Agreement or the other Loan Documents or by any document executed in 
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the 
other Loan Documents, or (iv) any claim, litigation, investigation or 
proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether or not any Indemnitee 
is a party thereto

87

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

(collectively, the Indemnified Matters); provided, however, that Borrower 
shall not have any obligation to any Indemnitee under this subsection (a) 
for any Indemnified Matter caused by the gross negligence or willful 
misconduct of such Indemnitee, as determined by a final judgment of a court 
of competent jurisdiction.

               (b) The indemnification for all of the foregoing losses, 
damages, fees, costs and expenses of the Indemnitees are chargeable against 
the Loan Account. To the extent that the undertaking to indemnify, pay and 
hold harmless set forth in this Section 12.15 may be unenforceable because 
it is violative of any law or public policy, the Borrower shall, jointly 
and severally, contribute the maximum portion which it is permitted to pay 
and satisfy under applicable law, to the payment and satisfaction of all 
Indemnified Matters incurred by the Indemnitees. The indemnities set forth 
in this Section 12.15 shall survive the repayment of the Obligations and 
discharge of any Liens granted under the Loan Documents.

          Section 12.16 Records. The unpaid principal of and interest on 
the Loans, the interest rate or rates applicable to such unpaid principal 
and interest, the duration of such applicability, the Commitments shall at 
all times be ascertained from the records of the Agents, which shall be 
conclusive and binding absent manifest error.

          Section 12.17 Binding Effect. This Agreement shall become 
effective when it shall have been executed by the Borrower, each Agent and 
each Lender and when the conditions precedent set forth in Section 5.01 
hereof have been satisfied or waived in writing by the Agents, and 
thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Borrower, 
each Agent and each Lender, and their respective successors and assigns, 
except that the Borrower shall not have the right to assign their rights 
hereunder or any interest herein without the prior written consent of each 
Agent and each Lender, and any assignment by any Lender shall be governed 
by Section 12.07 hereof.

          Section 12.18 Interest. It is the intention of the parties hereto 
that each Agent and each Lender shall conform strictly to usury laws 
applicable to it. Accordingly, if the transactions contemplated hereby or 
by any other Loan Document would be usurious as to any Agent or any Lender 
under laws applicable to it (including the laws of the United States of 
America and the State of New York or any other jurisdiction whose laws may 
be mandatorily applicable to such Agent or such Lender notwithstanding the 
other provisions of this Agreement), then, in that event, notwithstanding 
anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other Loan Document or 
any agreement entered into in connection with or as security for the 
Obligations, it is agreed as follows: (i) the aggregate of all 
consideration which constitutes interest under law applicable to any Agent 
or any Lender that is contracted for, taken, reserved, charged or received 
by such Agent or such Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan 
Document or agreements or otherwise in connection with the Obligations 
shall under no circumstances exceed the maximum amount allowed by such 
applicable law, any excess shall be canceled automatically and if 
theretofore paid shall be credited by such Agent or such Lender on the 
principal amount of the Obligations (or, to the extent that the principal 
amount of the Obligations shall have been or would thereby be paid in full, 
refunded by such Agent or such Lender, as applicable, to the Borrower); and 
(ii) in the event that the maturity of the Obligations is accelerated by 
reason of any Event of Default under this Agreement or otherwise, or in the 
event of any required or permitted prepayment, then such consideration that 
constitutes interest

88

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

under law applicable to any Agent or any Lender may never include more than 
the maximum amount allowed by such applicable law, and excess interest, if 
any, provided for in this Agreement or otherwise shall be canceled 
automatically by such Agent or such Lender, as applicable, as of the date 
of such acceleration or prepayment and, if theretofore paid, shall be 
credited by such Agent or such Lender, as applicable, on the principal 
amount of the Obligations (or, to the extent that the principal amount of 
the Obligations shall have been or would thereby be paid in full, refunded 
by such Agent or such Lender to the Borrower). All sums paid or agreed to 
be paid to any Agent or any Lender for the use, forbearance or detention of 
sums due hereunder shall, to the extent permitted by law applicable to such 
Agent or such Lender, be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread 
throughout the full term of the Loans until payment in full so that the 
rate or amount of interest on account of any Loans hereunder does not 
exceed the maximum amount allowed by such applicable law. If at any time 
and from time to time (x) the amount of interest payable to any Agent or 
any Lender on any date shall be computed at the Highest Lawful Rate 
applicable to such Agent or such Lender pursuant to this Section 12.18 and 
(y) in respect of any subsequent interest computation period the amount of 
interest otherwise payable to such Agent or such Lender would be less than 
the amount of interest payable to such Agent or such Lender computed at the 
Highest Lawful Rate applicable to such Agent or such Lender, then the 
amount of interest payable to such Agent or such Lender in respect of such 
subsequent interest computation period shall continue to be computed at the 
Highest Lawful Rate applicable to such Agent or such Lender until the total 
amount of interest payable to such Agent or such Lender shall equal the 
total amount of interest which would have been payable to such Agent or 
such Lender if the total amount of interest had been computed without 
giving effect to this Section 12.18.

          For purposes of this Section 12.18, the term applicable law 
shall mean that law in effect from time to time and applicable to the loan 
transaction between the Borrower, on the one hand, and the Agents and the 
Lenders, on the other, that lawfully permits the charging and collection of 
the highest permissible, lawful non-usurious rate of interest on such loan 
transaction and this Agreement, including laws of the State of New York 
and, to the extent controlling, laws of the United States of America.

          The right to accelerate the maturity of the Obligations does not 
include the right to accelerate any interest that has not accrued as of the 
date of acceleration.

          Section 12.19 Confidentiality. Each Agent and each Lender agrees 
(on behalf of itself and each of its affiliates, directors, officers, 
employees and representatives) to use reasonable precautions to keep 
confidential, in accordance with its customary procedures for handling 
confidential information of this nature and in accordance with safe and 
sound practices of comparable commercial finance companies, any non-public 
information supplied to it by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement or 
the other Loan Documents which is identified in writing by the Borrower as 
being confidential at the time the same is delivered to such Person (and 
which at the time is not, and does not thereafter become, publicly 
available or available to such Person from another source not known to be 
subject to a confidentiality obligation to such Person not to disclose such 
information), provided that nothing herein shall limit the disclosure of 
any such information (i) to the extent required by any Requirement of Law 
or judicial process or as otherwise requested by any Governmental 
Authority, (ii) to counsel for any Agent or any Lender, (iii) to examiners, 
auditors, accountants or Securitization parties; provided, that the

89

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

Agents and the Lenders shall not be entitled to disclose the identity of 
the Collateral Value Insurer to the Rating Agencies or, except as provided 
below, provide a copy of the Collateral Value Policy to the Rating 
Agencies, in each case, without the prior written consent of the Collateral 
Value Insurer; provided, further, that the Agents and the Lenders shall be 
permitted to disclose a copy of the Collateral Value Policy to the Rating 
Agencies so long as the identity of the Collateral Value Insurer is 
redacted, (iv) in connection with any litigation to which any Agent or any 
Lender is a party or (v) to any assignee or participant (or prospective 
assignee or participant) so long as such assignee or participant (or 
prospective assignee or participant) first agrees, in writing, to be bound 
by confidentiality provisions similar in substance to this Section 12.19.

          Section 12.20 Public Disclosure. The Borrower agrees that neither 
it nor any of its Affiliates will now or in the future issue any press 
release or other public disclosure using the name of an Agent, any Lender 
or any of their respective Affiliates or referring to this Agreement or any 
other Loan Document without the prior written consent of such Agent or such 
Lender, except to the extent that the Borrower or such Affiliate is 
required to do so under applicable law (in which event, the Borrower or 
such Affiliate will consult with such Agent or such Lender before issuing 
such press release or other public disclosure). The Borrower hereby 
authorizes each Agent and each Lender, after consultation with the 
Borrower, to advertise the closing of the transactions contemplated by this 
Agreement, and to make appropriate announcements of the financial 
arrangements entered into among the parties hereto, as such Agent or such 
Lender shall deem appropriate, including, without limitation, announcements 
commonly known as tombstones, in such trade publications, business 
journals, newspapers of general circulation and to such selected parties as 
such Agent or such Lender shall deem appropriate.

          Section 12.21 Integration. This Agreement, together with the 
other Loan Documents, reflects the entire understanding of the parties with 
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby and shall not be 
contradicted or qualified by any other agreement, oral or written, before 
the date hereof.

          Section 12.22 USA PATRIOT Act. Each Lender that is subject to the 
requirements of the USA PATRIOT Act (Title 111 of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed 
into law October 26, 2001)) (as amended, the USA PATRIOT Act) hereby 
notifies the Borrower that pursuant to the requirements of the USA PATRIOT 
Act, it is required to obtain, verify and record information that 
identifies the entities composing the Borrower, which information includes 
the name and address of each such entity and other information that will 
allow such Lender to identify the entities composing the Borrower in 
accordance with the USA PATRIOT Act. The Borrower agrees to take such 
action and execute, acknowledge and deliver at its sole cost and expense, 
such instruments and documents as any Lender may reasonably require from 
time to time in order to enable such Lender to comply with the USA PATRIOT 
Act.

be created hereby in the Collateral, except (A) for the filing under the 
Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in the applicable jurisdiction of the 
financing statements described in Schedule V hereto, all of which financing 
statements have been duly filed and are in full force and effect, , (B)

               (k) This Agreement creates a legal, valid and enforceable 
security interest in favor of the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the 
Secured Parties, in the Collateral, as security for the Secured 
Obligations. The Perfection Requirements result in the perfection of such 
security interests. Such security interests are, or in the case of 
Collateral in which the Grantor obtains rights after the date hereof, will 
be, perfected, first priority security interests, subject in priority only 
to the Permitted Liens that, pursuant to the definition of the term 
Permitted Liens, are not prohibited from being prior to the Liens in

               (l) As of the date hereof, the Grantor does not hold any 
Commercial Tort Claims or is not aware of any such pending claims, except 
for such claims described in Schedule VI.

               (m) The Grantor has irrevocably opted into Article 8 of the 
Uniform Commercial Code (collectively, the Certificated Entities). Such 
interests are securities for purposes of Article 8 of any relevant Uniform 
Commercial Code.

          SECTION 6. Covenants as to the Collateral. So long as any of the 
Secured Obligations (whether or not due) shall remain unpaid or any Lender 
shall have any Commitment under the Financing Agreement, unless the 
Collateral Agent shall otherwise consent in writing:

          (a) Further Assurances. The Grantor will at its expense, at any 
time and from time to time, promptly execute and deliver all further 
instruments and documents and take all further action that may be necessary 
or reasonably desirable or that the Collateral Agent may request in order 
(i) to perfect and protect, or maintain the perfection of, the security 
interest and Lien purported to be created hereby; (ii) to enable the 
Collateral Agent to exercise and enforce its rights and remedies hereunder 
in respect of the Collateral; or (iii) otherwise to effect the purposes of 
this Agreement, including, without limitation: (A) marking conspicuously 
all Chattel Paper and Instruments and, at the request of the Collateral 
Agent, all of its Records pertaining to the Collateral with a legend, in

security interest created hereby, (B) if any Account shall be evidenced by 
a Promissory Note or other Instrument or Chattel Paper, delivering and

respect to Intellectual Property hereafter existing and not covered by an 
appropriate security interest grant, the executing and recording in the 
United States Patent and Trademark Office or the United States Copyright

interest, as may be necessary or desirable or that the Collateral Agent may 
request in order to perfect and preserve the security interest purported to 
be created hereby, (E) delivering to the Collateral Agent irrevocable 
proxies in respect of the Pledged Interests, (F) furnishing to the 
Collateral Agent from time to time statements and schedules further 
identifying and describing the Collateral and such other reports in 
connection with the Collateral as the Collateral Agent may reasonably 
request, all in reasonable detail, (G) if any Collateral shall be in the 
possession of a third party, notifying such Person of the Collateral 
Agents security interest created hereby and obtaining a written agreement, 
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Agent, 
providing access to such Collateral in order to remove such Collateral from 
such premises during an Event of Default and acknowledging that such Person 
holds possession of the Collateral for the benefit of the Collateral Agent
, (H) if at any time after the date hereof, the Grantor acquires or holds 
any Commercial Tort Claim, immediately notifying the Collateral Agent in a 
writing signed by the Grantor setting forth a brief description of such 
Commercial Tort Claim and granting to the Collateral Agent a security 
interest therein and in the proceeds thereof, which writing shall 
incorporate the provisions hereof and shall be in form and substance 
reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Agent, and (I) taking all actions 
required by law in any relevant Uniform Commercial Code jurisdiction, or by 
other law as applicable in any foreign jurisdiction. No Grantor shall take 
or fail to take any action which would in any manner impair the validity or 
enforceability of the Collateral Agents security interest in and Lien on 
any Collateral.

               (b) Taxes, Etc. The Grantor agrees to pay promptly when due 
all property and other taxes, assessments and governmental charges or 
levies imposed upon, and all claims (including claims for labor, materials 
and supplies) against, the Collateral, except to the extent otherwise 
provided in the Financing Agreement.

               (c) Insurance. The Grantor will, at its own expense, 
maintain insurance with respect to the Collateral in accordance with the 
terms of the Financing Agreement. The Grantor will, if so requested by the 
Collateral Agent, deliver to the Collateral Agent original or duplicate 
insurance policies and, as often as the Collateral Agent may reasonably 
request, a report of a reputable insurance broker with respect to such 
insurance. The Grantor will also, at the request of the Collateral Agent, 
execute and deliver instruments of assignment of such insurance policies 
and cause the respective insurers to acknowledge notice of such assignment.

               (d) Provisions Concerning the Insurance Premium Loans. The 
Grantor will, except as otherwise provided in this subsection (d), continue 
to collect, at its own expense, all amounts due or to become due under the 
Insurance Premium Loans. In connection

-10-

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

with such collections, the Grantor may (and, at the Collateral Agents 
direction, will) take such action as the Grantor (or, if applicable, the 
Collateral Agent) may reasonably deem necessary or advisable to enforce 
collection or performance of the Insurance Premium Loans; provided, 
however, that the Collateral Agent shall have the right at any time, upon 
the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, to notify 
the Premium Finance Borrower or obligors under any Insurance Premium Loans 
of the assignment of such Insurance Premium Loans to the Collateral Agent 
and to direct such Premium Finance Borrower or obligors to make payment of 
all amounts due or to become due to the Grantor thereunder directly to the 
Collateral Agent or its designated agent and, upon such notification and at 
the expense of the Grantor and to the extent permitted by law, to enforce 
collection of any such Insurance Premium Loans and to adjust, settle or 
compromise the amount or payment thereof, in the same manner and to the 
same extent as the Grantor might have done. After receipt by the Grantor of 
a notice from the Collateral Agent that the Collateral Agent has notified, 
intends to notify, or has enforced or intends to enforce the Grantors 
rights against the Premium Finance Borrower or obligors under any Premium 
Finance Borrower as referred to in the proviso to the immediately preceding 
sentence, (A) all amounts and proceeds (including Instruments) received by 
the Grantor in respect of the Premium Finance Loans shall be received in 
trust for the benefit of the Collateral Agent hereunder, shall be 
segregated from other funds of the Grantor and shall be forthwith paid over 
to the Collateral Agent or its designated agent in the same form as so 
received (with any necessary endorsement) to be held as cash collateral and 
either (x) credited to the Loan Account so long as no Event of Default 
shall have occurred and be continuing or (y) if any Event of Default shall 
have occurred and be continuing, applied as specified in Section 9(d) 
hereof, and (B) the Grantor will not adjust, settle or compromise the 
amount or payment of any Insurance Premium Loan or release wholly or partly 
any Premium Finance Borrower or obligor thereof or allow any credit or 
discount thereon. The Collateral Agent may (in its sole and absolute 
discretion) direct any or all of the banks and financial institutions with 
which the Grantor either maintains a Deposit Account or a lockbox or 
deposits the proceeds of any Insurance Premium Loan to send immediately to 
the Collateral Agent or its designated agent by wire transfer (to such 
account as the Collateral Agent shall specify, or in such other manner as 
the Collateral Agent shall direct) all or a portion of such securities, 
cash, investments and other items held by such institution. Any such 
securities, cash, investments and other items so received by the Collateral 
Agent or its designated agent shall (in the sole and absolute discretion of 
the Collateral Agent) be held as additional Collateral for the Secured 
Obligations or distributed in accordance with Section 9 hereof.

               (e) Provisions Concerning the Pledged Interests. The Grantor 
will

                    (i) at the Grantors expense, promptly deliver to the 
Collateral Agent a copy of each notice or other communication received by 
it in respect of the Pledged Interests;

                    (ii) at the Grantors expense, defend the Collateral 
Agents right, title and security interest in and to the Pledged Interests 
against the claims of any Person;

                    (iii) not make or consent to any amendment or other 
modification or waiver with respect to any Pledged Interests or enter into 
any agreement or permit to exist any restriction with respect to any 
Pledged Interests other than pursuant to the

                    (iv) not permit the issuance of (A) any additional 
shares of any class of Equity Interests of any Pledged Issuer, (B) any 
securities convertible voluntarily by the holder thereof or automatically 
upon the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event or condition into, or 
exchangeable for, any such shares of Equity Interests or (C) any warrants, 
options, contracts or other commitments entitling any Person to purchase or 
otherwise acquire any such shares of Equity Interests.

                    (i) Except to the extent expressly permitted by Section 
7.02(c) of the Financing Agreement, the Grantor will not sell, assign (by 
operation of law or otherwise), lease, license, exchange or otherwise

                    (ii) Except to the extent expressly permitted by 
Section 7.02(a) of the Financing Agreement, the Grantor will not create,

                    (i) The Grantor (either itself or through its licensees

claim of abandonment or invalidity for non-use, (ii) maintain the quality 
of products and services offered under such Trademark, (iii) display such 
Trademark with notice of U.S. or non-U.S. registration to the extent 
necessary to establish and preserve its rights under applicable law, and

violation of any third party rights.

                    (ii) The Grantor shall notify the Collateral Agent 
promptly if it knows or has reason to know that any Intellectual Property 
material to the conduct of its business may become abandoned, lost or 
dedicated to the public, or of any final materially adverse determination 
(including the institution of, or any such determination in, any proceeding 
in the United States Patent and Trademark Office, United States Copyright 
Office or any court or similar office of any country) regarding the 
Grantors ownership of any Intellectual Property, its right to register the 
same, or its right to keep and maintain the same.

                    (iii) In the event that the Grantor (i) files an 
application or registration for any Intellectual Property with the United 
States Patent and Trademark Office, United States Copyright Office or any 
office or agency in any political subdivision of the United States or in 
any other country or any political subdivision thereof, either itself or 
through any agent, employee, licensee or designee or (ii) obtains rights to

Grantor shall give to the Collateral Agent prompt notice thereof, and, upon

agreements, instruments, documents and papers as the Collateral Agent may 
reasonably request to evidence the Collateral Agents security interest in

                    (v) In the event that the Grantor has reason to believe

               (b) The Grantor hereby irrevocably appoints the Collateral 
Agent as its attorney-in-fact and proxy, with full authority in the place 
and stead of the Grantor and in the name of the Grantor or otherwise, from 
time to time in the Collateral Agents discretion after the occurrence and 
during the continuance of an Event of Default, to take any action and to 
execute any instrument that the Collateral Agent may deem necessary or 
advisable to accomplish the purposes of this Agreement (subject to the 
rights of the Grantor under Section 6 hereof and Section 7(a) hereof), 
including, without limitation, (i) to obtain and adjust insurance required 
to be paid to the Collateral Agent pursuant to the Financing Agreement, 
(ii) to ask, demand, collect, sue for, recover, compound, receive and give 
acquittance and receipts for moneys due and to become due under or in 
respect of any Collateral, (iii) to receive, endorse, and collect any 
drafts or other Instruments, Documents and Chattel Paper in connection with 
clause (i) or (ii) above, (iv) to receive, indorse and collect all 
Instruments made payable to the Grantor representing any dividend, interest 
payment or other distribution in respect of any Pledged Interests and to 
give full discharge for the same, (v) to file any claims or take any action 
or institute any proceedings which the Collateral Agent may deem necessary 
or desirable for the collection of any Collateral or otherwise to enforce 
the rights of the Collateral Agent and the Lenders with respect to any 
Collateral, (vi) to execute assignments, licenses and other documents to 
enforce the rights of the Collateral Agent and the Lenders with respect to 
any Collateral, (vii) to pay or discharge taxes or Liens levied or placed 
upon or threatened against the Collateral, the legality or validity thereof 
and the amounts necessary to discharge the same to be determined by the 
Collateral Agent in its sole discretion, and such payments made by the 
Collateral Agent to become Obligations of the Grantor to the Collateral 
Agent, due and payable immediately without demand, and (viii) to sign and 
endorse any invoices, freight or express bills, bills of lading, storage or 
warehouse receipts, assignments, verifications and notices in connection 
with Accounts, Chattel Paper and other documents relating to the 
Collateral. This power is coupled with an interest and is irrevocable until 
the date on which all of the Secured Obligations have been indefeasibly 
paid in full in cash after the termination of each Lenders Commitment and 
each of the Loan Documents.

               (c) For the purpose of enabling the Collateral Agent to 
exercise rights and remedies hereunder, at such time as the Collateral 
Agent shall be lawfully entitled to exercise such rights and remedies, and 
for no other purpose, the Grantor hereby (i) grants to the Collateral Agent 
an irrevocable, non-exclusive license (exercisable without payment of 
royalty or other compensation to the Grantor) to use, assign, license or 
sublicense any Intellectual Property now or hereafter owned by the Grantor, 
wherever the same may be located, including in such license reasonable 
access to all media in which any of the licensed items may be recorded

-17-

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

or stored and to all computer programs used for the compilation or printout 
thereof; and (ii) assigns to the Collateral Agent, to the extent 
assignable, all of its rights to any Intellectual Property now or hereafter 
licensed or used by the Grantor. Notwithstanding anything contained herein 
to the contrary, but subject to the provisions of the Financing Agreement 
that limit the right of the Grantor to dispose of its property and Section 
6(g) hereof, so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be 
continuing, the Grantor may exploit, use, enjoy, protect, license, 
sublicense, assign, sell, dispose of or take other actions with respect to 
the Intellectual Property in the ordinary course of its business. In 
furtherance of the foregoing, unless an Event of Default shall have 
occurred and be continuing, the Collateral Agent shall from time to time, 
upon the request of the Grantor, execute and deliver any instruments, 
certificates or other documents, in the form so requested, which the 
Grantor shall have certified are appropriate (in the Grantors judgment) to 
allow it to take any action permitted above (including relinquishment of 
the license provided pursuant to this clause (c) as to any Intellectual 
Property). Further, upon the date on which all of the Secured Obligations 
have been indefeasibly paid in full in cash after the termination of each 
Lenders Commitment and each of the Loan Documents, the Collateral Agent 
(subject to Section 13(e) hereof) shall release and reassign to the Grantor 
all of the Collateral Agents right, title and interest in and to the 
Intellectual Property, all without recourse, representation or warranty 
whatsoever and at the Grantors sole expense. The exercise of rights and 
remedies hereunder by the Collateral Agent shall not terminate the rights 
of the holders of any licenses or sublicenses theretofore granted by the 
Grantor in accordance with the second sentence of this clause (c). The 
Grantor hereby releases the Collateral Agent from any claims, causes of 
action and demands at any time arising out of or with respect to any 
actions taken or omitted to be taken by the Collateral Agent under the 
powers of attorney granted herein other than actions taken or omitted to be 
taken through the Collateral Agents gross negligence or willful 
misconduct, as determined by a final determination of a court of competent 
jurisdiction.

               (d) If the Grantor fails to perform any agreement or 
obligation contained herein, the Collateral Agent may itself perform, or 
cause performance of, such agreement or obligation, in the name of the 
Grantor or the Collateral Agent, and the expenses of the Collateral Agent 
incurred in connection therewith shall be payable by the Grantor pursuant 
to Section 10 hereof and shall be secured by the Collateral.

               (e) The powers conferred on the Collateral Agent hereunder 
are solely to protect its interest in the Collateral and shall not impose 
any duty upon it to exercise any such powers. Other than the exercise of 
reasonable care to assure the safe custody of any Collateral in its 
possession and the accounting for moneys actually received by it hereunder, 
the Collateral Agent shall have no duty as to any Collateral or as to the 
taking of any necessary steps to preserve rights against prior parties or 
any other rights pertaining to any Collateral and shall be relieved of all 
responsibility for any Collateral in its possession upon surrendering it or 
tendering surrender of it to the Grantor (or whomsoever shall be lawfully 
entitled to receive the same or as a court of competent jurisdiction shall 
direct). The Collateral Agent shall be deemed to have exercised reasonable 
care in the custody and preservation of any Collateral in its possession if 
such Collateral is accorded treatment substantially equal to that which the 
Collateral Agent accords its own property, it being understood that the 
Collateral Agent shall not have responsibility for ascertaining or taking 
action with respect to calls, conversions, exchanges, maturities, tenders 
or other matters relating to any Collateral, whether or not the Collateral 
Agent has or is deemed to have knowledge of such matters. The Collateral 
Agent shall not be liable or

-18-

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

responsible for any loss or damage to any of the Collateral, or for any 
diminution in the value thereof, by reason of the act or omission of any 
warehouseman, carrier, forwarding agency, consignee or other agent or 
bailee selected by the Collateral Agent in good faith.

               (f) The Collateral Agent may at any time in its discretion 
(i) without notice to the Grantor, transfer or register in the name of the 
Collateral Agent or any of its nominees any or all of the Pledged 
Interests, subject only to the revocable rights of the Grantor under 
Section 7(a) hereof, and (ii) exchange certificates or Instruments 
constituting Pledged Interests for certificates or Instruments of smaller 
or larger denominations.

          SECTION 9. Remedies Upon Default. If any Event of Default shall 
have occurred and be continuing:

               (a) The Collateral Agent may exercise in respect of the 
Collateral, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided for 
herein or otherwise available to it, all of the rights and remedies of a 
secured party upon default under the Code (whether or not the Code applies 
to the affected Collateral), and also may (i) take absolute control of the 
Collateral, including, without limitation, transfer into the Collateral 
Agents name or into the name of its nominee or nominees (to the extent the 
Collateral Agent has not theretofore done so) and thereafter receive, for 
the benefit of the Collateral Agent and the Lenders, all payments made 
thereon, give all consents, waivers and ratifications in respect thereof 
and otherwise act with respect thereto as though it were the outright owner 
thereof, (ii) require the Grantor to, and the Grantor hereby agrees that it 
will at its expense and upon request of the Collateral Agent forthwith, 
assemble all or part of the Collateral as directed by the Collateral Agent 
and make it available to the Collateral Agent at a place or places to be 
designated by the Collateral Agent that is reasonably convenient to both 
parties, and the Collateral Agent may enter into and occupy any premises 
owned or leased by the Grantor where the Collateral or any part thereof is 
located or assembled for a reasonable period in order to effectuate the 
Collateral Agents rights and remedies hereunder or under law, without 
obligation to the Grantor in respect of such occupation, and (iii) without 
notice except as specified below and without any obligation to prepare or 
process the Collateral for sale, (A) sell the Collateral or any part 
thereof in one or more parcels at public or private sale, at any of the 
Collateral Agents offices, at any exchange or brokers board or elsewhere, 
for cash, on credit or for future delivery, and at such price or prices and 
upon such other terms as the Collateral Agent may deem commercially 
reasonable and/or (B) lease, license or otherwise dispose of the Collateral 
or any part thereof upon such terms as the Collateral Agent may deem 
commercially reasonable. The Grantor agrees that, to the extent notice of 
sale or any other disposition of the Collateral shall be required by law, 
at least five (5) Business Days prior written notice to the Grantor of the 
time and place of any public sale or the time after which any private sale 
or other disposition of the Collateral is to be made shall constitute 
reasonable notification. The Collateral Agent shall not be obligated to 
make any sale or other disposition of Collateral regardless of notice of 
sale having been given. The Collateral Agent may adjourn any public or 
private sale from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed 
therefor, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time 
and place to which it was so adjourned. The Grantor hereby waives any 
claims against the Collateral Agent and the Lenders arising by reason of 
the fact that the price at which the Collateral may have been sold at a 
private sale was less than the price which might have been obtained at a 
public sale or was less than the aggregate amount of the Secured 
Obligations, even if the Collateral Agent

-19-

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

accepts the first offer received and does not offer the Collateral to more 
than one offeree, and waives all rights that the Grantor may have to 
require that all or any part of the Collateral be marshaled upon any sale 
(public or private) thereof. The Grantor hereby acknowledges that (i) any 
such sale of the Collateral by the Collateral Agent shall be made without 
warranty, (ii) the Collateral Agent may specifically disclaim any 
warranties of title, possession, quiet enjoyment or the like, (iii) the 
Collateral Agent may bid (which bid may be, in whole or in part, in the 
form of cancellation of indebtedness), if permitted by law, for the 
purchase, lease, license or other disposition of the Collateral or any 
portion thereof for the account of the Collateral Agent (on behalf of 
itself and the Lenders) and (iv) such actions set forth in clauses (i), 
(ii) and (iii) above shall not adversely affect the commercial 
reasonableness of any such sale of the Collateral. In addition to the 
foregoing, (i) upon written notice to the Grantor from the Collateral 
Agent, the Grantor shall cease any use of the Intellectual Property or any 
trademark, patent or copyright similar thereto for any purpose described in 
such notice; (ii) the Collateral Agent may, at any time and from time to 
time, upon five (5) Business Days prior written notice to the Grantor, 
license, whether general, special or otherwise, and whether on an exclusive 
or non-exclusive basis, any of the Intellectual Property, throughout the 
universe for such term or terms, on such conditions, and in such manner, as 
the Collateral Agent shall in its sole discretion determine; and (iii) the 
Collateral Agent may, at any time, pursuant to the authority granted in 
Section 8 hereof (such authority being effective upon the occurrence and 
during the continuance of an Event of Default), execute and deliver on 
behalf of the Grantor, one or more instruments of assignment of the 
Intellectual Property (or any application or registration thereof), in form 
suitable for filing, recording or registration in any country.

               (b) In the event that the Collateral Agent determines to 
exercise its right to sell all or any part of the Pledged Interests 
pursuant to Section 9(a) hereof, the Grantor will, at the Grantors expense 
and upon request by the Collateral Agent: (i) execute and deliver, and 
cause each issuer of such Pledged Interests and the directors and officers 
thereof to execute and deliver, all such instruments and documents, and do 
or cause to be done all such other acts and things, as may be necessary or, 
in the reasonable opinion of the Collateral Agent, advisable to register 
such Pledged Interests under the provisions of the Securities Act, and to 
cause the registration statement relating thereto to become effective and 
to remain effective for such period as prospectuses are required by law to 
be furnished, and to make all amendments and supplements thereto and to the 
related prospectus which, in the reasonable opinion of the Collateral 
Agent, are necessary or advisable, all in conformity with the requirements 
of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC applicable 
thereto, (ii) cause each issuer of such Pledged Interests to qualify such 
Pledged Interests under the state securities or Blue Sky laws of each 
jurisdiction, and to obtain all necessary governmental approvals for the 
sale of the Pledged Interests, as requested by the Collateral Agent, (iii) 
cause each Pledged Issuer to make available to its securityholders, as soon 
as practicable, an earnings statement which will satisfy the provisions of 
Section 11(a) of the Securities Act, and (iv) do or cause to be done all 
such other acts and things as may be necessary to make such sale of such 
Pledged Interests valid and binding and in compliance with applicable law. 
The Grantor acknowledges the impossibility of ascertaining the amount of 
damages which would be suffered by the Collateral Agent by reason of the 
failure by the Grantor to perform any of the covenants contained in this 
Section 9(b) and, consequently, agrees that, if the Grantor fails to 
perform any of such covenants, it shall pay, as liquidated damages and not 
as a penalty, an amount equal to the value of the Pledged Interests on the 
date the Collateral Agent demands compliance with this Section 9(b); 
provided,

-20-

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

however, that the payment of such amount shall not release the Grantor from 
any of its obligations under any of the other Loan Documents.

               (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 9(b) hereof, 
the Grantor recognizes that the Collateral Agent may deem it impracticable 
to effect a public sale of all or any part of the Pledged Shares or any 
other securities constituting Pledged Interests and that the Collateral 
Agent may, therefore, determine to make one or more private sales of any 
such securities to a restricted group of purchasers who will be obligated 
to agree, among other things, to acquire such securities for their own 
account, for investment and not with a view to the distribution or resale 
thereof. The Grantor acknowledges that any such private sale may be at 
prices and on terms less favorable to the seller than the prices and other 
terms which might have been obtained at a public sale and, notwithstanding 
the foregoing, agrees that such private sales shall be deemed to have been 
made in a commercially reasonable manner and that the Collateral Agent 
shall have no obligation to delay the sale of any such securities for the 
period of time necessary to permit the issuer of such securities to 
register such securities for public sale under the Securities Act. The 
Grantor further acknowledges and agrees that any offer to sell such 
securities which has been (i) publicly advertised on a bona fide basis in a 
newspaper or other publication of general circulation in the financial 
community of New York, New York (to the extent that such an offer may be so 
advertised without prior registration under the Securities Act) or (ii) 
made privately in the manner described above to not less than fifteen bona 
fide offerees shall be deemed to involve a public disposition for the 
purposes of Section 9-610(c) of the Code (or any successor or similar, 
applicable statutory provision) as then in effect in the State of New York, 
notwithstanding that such sale may not constitute a public offering under 
the Securities Act, and that the Collateral Agent may, in such event, bid 
for the purchase of such securities.

               (d) Any cash held by the Collateral Agent (or its agent or 
designee) as Collateral and all Cash Proceeds received by the Collateral 
Agent (or its agent or designee) in respect of any sale of or collection 
from, or other realization upon, all or any part of the Collateral may, in 
the discretion of the Collateral Agent, be held by the Collateral Agent (or 
its agent or designee) as collateral for, and/or then or at any time 
thereafter applied (after payment of any amounts payable to the Collateral 
Agent pursuant to Section 10 hereof) in whole or in part by the Collateral 
Agent against, all or any part of the Secured Obligations in such order as 
the Collateral Agent shall elect, consistent with the provisions of the 
Financing Agreement. Any surplus of such cash or Cash Proceeds held by the 
Collateral Agent (or its agent or designee) and remaining after the date on 
which all of the Secured Obligations have been indefeasibly paid in full in 
cash after the termination of each Lenders Commitment and each of the Loan 
Documents, shall be paid over to whomsoever shall be lawfully entitled to 
receive the same or as a court of competent jurisdiction shall direct.

               (e) In the event that the proceeds of any such sale, 
collection or realization are insufficient to pay all amounts to which the 
Collateral Agent and the Lenders are legally entitled, the Grantor shall be 
liable for the deficiency, together with interest thereon at the highest 
rate specified in any applicable Loan Document for interest on overdue 
principal thereof or such other rate as shall be fixed by applicable law, 
together with the costs of collection and the reasonable fees, costs, 
expenses and other client charges of any attorneys employed by the 
Collateral Agent to collect such deficiency.

-21-

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

               (f) The Grantor hereby acknowledges that if the Collateral 
Agent complies with any applicable requirements of law in connection with a 
disposition of the Collateral, such compliance will not adversely affect 
the commercial reasonableness of any sale or other disposition of the 
Collateral.

               (g) The Collateral Agent shall not be required to marshal 
any present or future collateral security (including, but not limited to, 
this Agreement and the Collateral) for, or other assurances of payment of, 
the Secured Obligations or any of them or to resort to such collateral 
security or other assurances of payment in any particular order, and all of 
the Collateral Agents rights hereunder and in respect of such collateral 
security and other assurances of payment shall be cumulative and in 
addition to all other rights, however existing or arising. To the extent 
that the Grantor lawfully may, the Grantor hereby agrees that it will not 
invoke any law relating to the marshalling of collateral which might cause 
delay in or impede the enforcement of the Collateral Agents rights under 
this Agreement or under any other instrument creating or evidencing any of 
the Secured Obligations or under which any of the Secured Obligations is 
outstanding or by which any of the Secured Obligations is secured or 
payment thereof is otherwise assured, and, to the extent that it lawfully 
may, the Grantor hereby irrevocably waives the benefits of all such laws.

          SECTION 10. Indemnity and Expenses.

               (a) The Grantor agrees to defend, protect, indemnify and 
hold harmless each Agent and each other Indemnitee from and against any and 
all claims, losses, damages, liabilities, obligations, penalties, fees, 
reasonable costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable 
attorneys fees, costs, expenses and disbursements) incurred by such Agent 
or such Indemnitee to the extent that they arise out of or otherwise result 
from or relate to or are in connection with this Agreement (including, 
without limitation, enforcement of this Agreement), except claims, losses 
or liabilities resulting solely and directly from such Agents or any such 
Indemnitees gross negligence or willful misconduct, as determined by a 
final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.

               (b) The Grantor agrees to pay to the Agents upon demand the 
amount of any and all costs and expenses, including the reasonable fees, 
costs, expenses and disbursements of counsel for the Agents and of any 
experts and agents (including, without limitation, any collateral trustee 
which may act as agent of the Agents), which the Agents may incur in 
connection with (i) the preparation, negotiation, execution, delivery, 
recordation, administration, amendment, waiver or other modification or 
termination of this Agreement, (ii) the custody, preservation, use or 
operation of, or the sale of, collection from, or other realization upon, 
any Collateral, (iii) the exercise or enforcement of any of the rights of 
the Agents hereunder, or (iv) the failure by the Grantor to perform or 
observe any of the provisions hereof.

-22-

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

          SECTION 11. Notices, Etc. All notices and other communications 
provided for hereunder shall be given in accordance with the notice 
provision of the Financing Agreement.

          SECTION 12. Security Interest Absolute; Joint and Several 
Obligations.

                    (a) All rights of the Secured Parties, all Liens and 
all obligations of the Grantor hereunder shall be absolute and 
unconditional irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of 
the Financing Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) any change in the 
time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term in respect of, 
all or any of the Secured Obligations, or any other amendment or waiver of 
or consent to any departure from the Financing Agreement or any other Loan 
Document, (iii) any exchange or release of, or non-perfection of any Lien 
on any Collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to 
departure from any guaranty, for all or any of the Secured Obligations, or 
(iv) any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense 
available to, or a discharge of, the Grantor in respect of the Secured 
Obligations. All authorizations and agencies contained herein with respect 
to any of the Collateral are irrevocable and powers coupled with an 
interest.

                    (b) The Grantor hereby waives (i) promptness and 
diligence, (ii) notice of acceptance and notice of the incurrence of any 
Obligation by any Borrower, (iii) notice of any actions taken by any Agent, 
any Lender, any Guarantor or any other Person under any Loan Document or 
any other agreement, document or instrument relating thereto, (iv) all 
other notices, demands and protests, and all other formalities of every 
kind in connection with the enforcement of the Obligations, the omission of 
or delay in which, but for the provisions of this subsection (b), might 
constitute grounds for relieving the Grantor of any of Grantors 
obligations hereunder and (v) any requirement that any Agent or any Lender 
protect, secure, perfect or insure any security interest or other lien on 
any property subject thereto or exhaust any right or take any action 
against the Grantor or any other Person or any collateral.

          SECTION 13. Miscellaneous.

               (a) No amendment of any provision of this Agreement 
(including any Schedule attached hereto) shall be effective unless it is in 
writing and signed by the Grantor affected thereby and the Collateral 
Agent, and no waiver of any provision of this Agreement, and no consent to 
any departure by the Grantor therefrom, shall be effective unless it is in 
writing and signed by the Collateral Agent, and then such waiver or consent 
shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific 
purpose for which given.

               (b) No failure on the part of the Secured Parties to 
exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right hereunder or under any 
other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single 
or partial exercise of any such right preclude any other or further 
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right. The rights and 
remedies of the Secured Parties provided herein and in the other Loan 
Documents are cumulative and are in addition to, and not exclusive of, any 
rights or remedies provided by law. The rights of the Secured Parties under 
any Loan Document against any party thereto are not conditional or 
contingent on any attempt by such Person to exercise any of its rights 
under any other Loan Document against such party or against any other 
Person, including but not limited to, the Grantor.

-23-

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

               (c) This Agreement shall create a continuing security 
interest in the Collateral and shall (i) remain in full force and effect, 
subject to paragraph (e) below, until the date on which all of the Secured 
Obligations have been indefeasibly paid in full in cash after the 
termination of each Lenders Commitment and each of the Loan Documents and 
(ii) be binding on the Grantor all other Persons who become bound as debtor 
to this Agreement in accordance with Section 9-203(d) of the Code, and 
shall inure, together with all rights and remedies of the Secured Parties 
hereunder, to the benefit of the Secured Parties and their respective 
successors, transferees and assigns. Without limiting the generality of 
clause (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence, the Secured Parties may 
assign or otherwise transfer their respective rights and obligations under 
this Agreement and any other Loan Document to any other Person pursuant to 
the terms of the Financing Agreement, and such other Person shall thereupon 
become vested with all of the benefits in respect thereof granted to the 
Secured Parties and herein or otherwise. Upon any such assignment or 
transfer, all references in this Agreement to any Secured Party shall mean 
the assignee of any such Secured Party. None of the rights or obligations 
of the Grantor hereunder may be assigned or otherwise transferred without 
the prior written consent of the Collateral Agent, and any such assignment 
or transfer shall be null and void.

               (d) Upon the date on which all of the Secured Obligations 
have been indefeasibly paid in full in cash after the termination of each 
Lenders Commitment and each of the Loan Documents, (i) subject to 
paragraph (e) below, this Agreement and the security interests and licenses 
created hereby shall terminate and all rights to the Collateral shall 
revert to the Grantor and (ii) the Collateral Agent will, upon the 
Grantors request and at the Grantors expense, without any representation, 
warranty or recourse whatsoever, (A) return to the Grantor (or whomsoever 
shall be lawfully entitled to receive the same or as a court of competent 
jurisdiction shall direct) such of the Collateral as shall not have been 
sold or otherwise disposed of or applied pursuant to the terms hereof and 
(B) execute and deliver to the Grantor such documents as the Grantor shall 
reasonably request to evidence such termination.

               (e) This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and 
continue to be effective should any petition be filed by or against the 
Grantor for liquidation or reorganization, should the Grantor become 
insolvent or make an assignment for the benefit of any creditor or 
creditors or should a receiver or trustee be appointed for all or any 
significant part of the Grantors assets, and shall continue to be 
effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment or 
performance of the Secured Obligations, or any part thereof, is, pursuant 
to applicable law, rescinded or reduced in amount, or must otherwise be 
restored or returned by any obligee of the Secured Obligations, whether as 
a voidable preference, fraudulent conveyance, or otherwise, all as 
though such payment or performance had not been made. In the event that any 
payment, or any part thereof, is rescinded, reduced, restored or returned, 
the Secured Obligations shall be reinstated and deemed reduced only by such 
amount paid and not so rescinded, reduced, restored or returned.

               (f) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, CONSTRUED AND 
INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, EXCEPT AS 
REQUIRED BY MANDATORY PROVISIONS OF LAW AND EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT THE 
VALIDITY AND PERFECTION OR THE PERFECTION AND THE EFFECT OF PERFECTION OR

-24-

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

NON-PERFECTION OF THE SECURITY INTEREST CREATED HEREBY, OR REMEDIES 
HEREUNDER, IN RESPECT OF ANY PARTICULAR COLLATERAL ARE GOVERNED BY THE LAW 
OF A JURISDICTION OTHER THAN THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

               (g) In addition to and without limitation of any of the 
foregoing, this Agreement shall be deemed to be a Loan Document and shall 
otherwise be subject to all of terms and conditions contained in Sections 
12.10 and 12.11 of the Financing Agreement, mutatis mutandi.

               (h) The Grantor irrevocably and unconditionally waives any 
right it may have to claim or recover in any legal action, suit or 
proceeding with respect to this Agreement any special, exemplary, punitive 
or consequential damages.

               (i) Any provision of this Agreement which is prohibited or 
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be 
ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without 
invalidating the remaining portions hereof or thereof or affecting the 
validity or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction.

               (j) Section headings herein are included for convenience of 
reference only and shall not constitute a part of this Agreement for any

the Lenders under any Loan Document but for the fact that they are 
unenforceable or not allowable due to the existence of a bankruptcy, 
reorganization or similar proceeding involving any Credit Party.

          (b) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Guaranty, except 
as provided in clause (ii) of this Section 2(b) and Section 2(c), (x) the 
Guarantor shall not have any liability under this Guaranty for the payment 
or performance of the Guaranteed Obligations, (y) the Guarantor shall not 
have any obligation to expend its own funds in the performance of any 
provision of any Loan Document, and (z) no Agent nor any Lender shall 
obtain any deficiency judgment against the Guarantor with respect to any of 
the foregoing; provided, however, that:

               (i) nothing contained herein shall limit or otherwise 
restrict (A) any Agents or any Lenders rights and remedies against any of 
the Collateral under any other Loan Document, either at law or equity, 
including, without limitation, any rights or remedies with respect to the 
Equity Interests of the Borrower owned by the Guarantor, (B) the Agent or 
any Lender from bringing any action, suit or proceeding for specific 
performance against the Guarantor to perform any obligation imposed on the 
Guarantor hereunder, (C) recourse to or liability of the Guarantor for any 
fraud committed by the Guarantor or material misrepresentation by the 
Guarantor in any Loan Document to which the Guarantor is a party, or (D) 
the obligations of the Guarantor under any Loan Document which obligations 
are either directly in favor of any Agent or any Lender or have been 
assigned to any Agent or any Lender, each of which may be enforced by and 
for the benefit of the Agents and Lenders, and

               (ii) the Guarantor shall have (A) full liability and 
responsibility for the Guaranteed Obligations and other obligations 
hereunder if (x) any act (or omission to act) constituting fraud or willful 
misconduct on the part of the Guarantor that impairs the Agents and the 
Lenders ability to be repaid under the Loan Documents occurs, or (y) the 
Guarantor authorizes, approves, participates in or assists the Borrower or 
the Originator in commencing a voluntary or involuntary case under the 
Bankruptcy Code or any other Insolvency Proceeding, and (B) liability and 
responsibility for the Guaranteed Obligations and other obligations 
hereunder if (x) any Collections are not promptly deposited directly into 
the Collection Account (other than Collections (i) delivered to the 
Servicer pursuant to the Servicing Agreement or (ii) inadvertently 
deposited into an account of the Originator or any Affiliate and promptly 
removed from such account and deposited into the Collection Account); 
provided, that in the case of this clause (B)(x), such liability and 
responsibility of the Guarantor shall not exceed the aggregate amount of 
the Collections not promptly deposited directly into the Collection Account 
or (y) the Guarantor and/or an agent or employee of Imperial and/or its 
Subsidiaries or any Person

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

appointed by the Borrower to perform any duties on behalf of the Borrower 
in connection with the Collateral Value Policy or Contingent Collateral 
Value Policy shall refer any claim to the Collateral Value Insurer or 
Contingent Collateral Value Insurer knowing the same to be fraudulent and 
at the time, the Borrower is not owned by a Lender or its Affiliates; 
provided, that in the case of this clause (B)(y), such liability and 
responsibility of the Guarantor shall not exceed the aggregate amount of 
the loss relating to the applicable Coverage Certificate related to such 
fraudulent claim and shall only arise if the action involved was taken by 
the Guarantor and/or an agent or employee of Imperial and/or its 
Subsidiaries or any Person appointed by the Borrower to perform any duties 
on behalf of the Borrower in connection with the Collateral Value Policy or 
the Contingent Collateral Value Policy or (z) the applicable Premium 
Finance Borrower, the Originator or the Borrower ceases to be the legal 
owner of a Covered Policy (as defined in the Collateral Value Policy or 
Contingent Collateral Value Policy) and the Guarantor and/or an employee of 
Imperial and/or its Subsidiaries (collectively, the Guarantor Responsible 
Parties), directly or indirectly, caused, or assisted another Person in, 
the transfer of legal title of such Covered Policy from the applicable 
Premium Finance Borrower, the Originator or the Borrower to another Person 
other than the Collateral Value Insurer or the Contingent Collateral Value 
Insurer (or a designee of the Collateral Value Insurer or the Contingent 
Collateral Value Insurer); provided, that in the case of this clause 
(B)(z), such liability and responsibility of the Guarantor shall not exceed 
the aggregate amount of the loss relating to the applicable Coverage 
Certificate related to such Covered Policy; provided further, and for 
greater clarity, in the case of this clause (B)(z), any transfer or change 
in legal ownership caused solely by a Person other than a Guarantor 
Responsible Party that is permitted by the Transaction Documents shall not 
result in liability or responsibility hereunder for the Guarantor.

          (c) Nothing in subsection (b) of this Section 2 shall limit or 
otherwise restrict in any manner the rights, powers and privileges of any 
Agent against the Guarantor under any other Loan Document to which the 
Guarantor is a party.

          SECTION 3. Guaranty Absolute; Continuing Guaranty; Assignments.

          (a) Subject to Sections 2(b) and 2(c) of this Agreement, the 
Guarantor hereby guarantees that the Guaranteed Obligations will be paid 
strictly in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents, regardless of 
any law, regulation or order now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction 
affecting any of such terms or the rights of the Agents or the Lenders with 
respect thereto. The Guarantor agrees that, subject to Sections 2(b) and 
2(c) of this Agreement, his guarantee constitutes a guaranty of payment 
when due and not of collection and waives any right to require that any 
resort be made by the Agents or the Lenders to any Collateral. The 
obligations of the Guarantor under this Guaranty are independent of the 
obligations under the Financing Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and 
a separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against the 
Guarantor to enforce this Guaranty, irrespective of whether any action is 
brought against any Credit Party or whether any Credit Party is joined in 
any such action or actions. Subject to Sections 2(b) and 2(c) of this 
Agreement, the liability of the Guarantor under this Guaranty shall be 
irrevocable, absolute and unconditional irrespective of, and the Guarantor 
hereby irrevocably waives any defenses it may now or hereafter have in any 
way relating to, any or all of the following:

- 3 -

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

               (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Loan 
Document or any agreement or instrument relating thereto;

               (ii) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, 
or in any other term in respect of, all or any of the Guaranteed 
Obligations, or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to 
departure from any Loan Document, including, without limitation, any 
increase in the Guaranteed Obligations resulting from the extension of 
additional credit to any Credit Party or otherwise;

               (iii) any taking, exchange, release or non-perfection of any 
Collateral, or any taking, release or amendment or waiver of or consent to 
departure from any other guaranty, for all or any of the Guaranteed 
Obligations;

               (iv) the existence of any claim, set-off, defense or other 
right that the Guarantor may have against any Person, including, without 
limitation, any Agent or any Lender;

               (v) any change, restructuring or termination of the limited 
liability company structure or existence of the Borrower; or

               (vi) any other circumstance (including any statute of 
limitations) or any existence of or reliance on any representation by the 
Agents or the Lenders that might otherwise constitute a defense available 
to, or a discharge of, any Credit Party or any other guarantor or surety.

This Guaranty shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case 
may be, if at any time any payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations is 
rescinded or must otherwise be returned by the Agents, the Lenders or any 
other Person upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of any 
Credit Party or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made.

          (b) This Guaranty is a continuing guaranty and shall (i) remain 
in full force and effect until the later of (x) the cash payment in full of 
the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under this 
Guaranty and (y) the Final Maturity Date, (ii) be binding upon the 
Guarantor, his heirs, executors, administrators, legal representatives, 
successors and assigns and (iii) inure to the benefit of and be enforceable 
by the Agents, the Lenders and their successors, pledgees, transferees and 
assigns. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing clause (iii), any 
Lender may pledge, assign or otherwise transfer all or any portion of his 
rights and obligations under any Loan Document to any other Person, and 
such other Person shall thereupon become vested with all the benefits in 
respect thereof granted to such Lender herein or otherwise, in each case as 
provided in the Financing Agreement.

          SECTION 4. Waivers. The Guarantor hereby waives, to the full 
extent permitted by applicable law, (i) promptness and diligence; (ii) 
notice of acceptance and notice of the incurrence of any Obligation by the 
Borrower; (iii) notice of any actions taken by any Agent, the Borrower, any 
Credit Party or any Lender under any Loan Document or any other agreement 
or instrument related thereto; (iv) all other notices, demands and 
protests, and all other formalities of every kind in connection with the 
enforcement of the Obligations or of the obligations of the Guarantor 
hereunder, the omission of or delay in which, but for the provisions of 
this Section 4, might constitute grounds for relieving the Guarantor of his 
obligations

- 4 -

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

hereunder; (v) any right to compel or direct any Agent or any Lender to 
seek payment or recovery of any amounts owed under this Guaranty from any 
one particular fund or source; (vi) any requirement that any Agent or any 
Lender protect, secure, perfect or insure any security interest or Lien or 
any property subject thereto or exhaust any right or take any action 
against the Borrower, any other Credit Party or any other Person or any 
Collateral; and (vii) any other defense available to the Guarantor. The 
Guarantor acknowledges that it will receive direct and indirect benefits 
from the financing arrangements contemplated herein and that the waiver set 
forth in this Section 4 is knowingly made in contemplation of such 
benefits. The Guarantor hereby waives any right to revoke this Guaranty, 
and acknowledges that this Guaranty is continuing in nature and applies to 
all Guaranteed Obligations, whether existing now or in the future.

          SECTION 5. Subrogation. (a) Until the final payment in cash and 
performance in full of all of the Obligations, the Guarantor shall not 
exercise any rights against the Borrower or any other guarantor arising as 
a result of payment by the Borrower or such guarantor hereunder, by way of 
subrogation, reimbursement, restitution, contribution or otherwise, and 
will not prove any claim in competition with any Agent or any Lender in 
respect of any payment hereunder in any Insolvency Proceedings; the 
Guarantor will not claim any set-off, recoupment or counterclaim against 
the Borrower or any other guarantor in respect of any liability of the 
Guarantor to the Borrower or guarantor; and the Guarantor, the Borrower and 
each guarantor waives any benefit of and any right to participate in any 
collateral security which may be held by any Agent or any Lender. Anything 
to the contrary contained in the foregoing notwithstanding, the Guarantor 
shall not exercise any such rights against the Borrower (including after 
payment in full of the Obligations) if all or any portion of the 
Obligations shall have been satisfied in connection with an exercise of 
remedies by the Collateral Agent in respect of the Equity Interests of the 
Borrower whether pursuant to the Individual Guarantor Security Agreement or 
otherwise.

          (b) The payment of any amounts due with respect to any 
Indebtedness of the Borrower or the Guarantor for money borrowed or credit 
received now or hereafter owed to the Guarantor is hereby subordinated to 
the prior payment in full of all of the Obligations. The Guarantor agrees 
that, after the occurrence of any default in the payment or performance of 
any of the Obligations, the Guarantor will not demand, sue for or otherwise 
attempt to collect any such indebtedness of the Borrower or other guarantor 
to the Guarantor until all of the Obligations shall have been paid in full. 
If, notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the Guarantor shall collect, 
enforce or receive any amounts in respect of such indebtedness while any 
Obligations are still outstanding, such amounts shall be collected, 
enforced and received by the Guarantor as trustee for the Agents and the 
Lenders and be paid over to the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the 
Agents and the Lenders, on account of the Obligations without affecting in 
any manner the liability of the Guarantor under the other provisions of 
this Guaranty.

          SECTION 6. Representations, Warranties. The Guarantor hereby 
represents and warrants as follows:

          (a) The Guarantor has the legal capacity and right to execute, 
deliver and perform this Guaranty and each other Loan Document to which the 
Guarantor is a party.

notice to or filing with, any Governmental Authority is required in 
connection with the due execution, delivery and performance by the 
Guarantor of this Guaranty or any of the other Loan Documents to which the 
Guarantor is a party, except for the filing of any UCC financing statement 
or such other registrations, filings or recordings as may be necessary to

Guarantor is a party.

          (d) Each of this Guaranty and the other Loan Documents to which

applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other 
similar laws.

          (e) There are no pending or written notices threatening any

or subject to any restriction or any judgment, order, regulation, ruling or 
other requirement of a court or other Governmental Authority, which has, or 
in the future could have, a material adverse effect to the Guarantors 
financial condition.

          (h) The Guarantor has filed or caused to be filed all tax returns 
which he is required to file and has paid all taxes shown to be due and 
payable on such returns or on any assessments made against the Guarantor or 
any of he property by any Governmental Authority except to the extent any 
such taxes are being contested in good faith. No tax Lien has been filed 
with respect to any material tax liability against the Guarantor, and, to 
the knowledge of the Guarantor, no tax assessment is pending against the 
Guarantor.

          (i) The Guarantor (i) has read and understands the terms and 
conditions of the Financing Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and

Borrower or the other Credit Parties that may come under the control of any 
Agent or any Lender.

          (j) All representations and warranties set forth in this Guaranty 
are true and correct in all respects at the time as of which such 
representations were made and on the Effective Date.

          SECTION 7. Covenants. The Guarantor hereby covenants and agrees 
that, until full and final payment of the Obligations in cash and the 
termination of the Total Term Loan Commitment, the Guarantor will:

          (a) Not accept or retain any distribution or other payment from

Borrower violates, or may reasonably be expected to result in a violation 
of, the Financing Agreement or any other Loan Document.

          (b) Comply in all material respects with all Requirements of Law

presents the financial condition of the Guarantor as of the Effective Date 
and that the Guarantor has no contingent obligations or liabilities (for 
taxes or otherwise) or any unusual long term commitment except as set forth 
in such financial statement or the notes thereto.

and other indebtedness at any time owing by any Agent or any Lender to or 
for the credit or the account of the Guarantor against any and all 
obligations of the Guarantor either now or hereafter existing under this 
Guaranty or any other Loan Document, irrespective of whether or not any 
Agent or any Lender shall have made any demand under this Guaranty or any 
other Loan Document and although such obligations may be contingent or 
unmatured. Each of the Agents and Lenders agrees to notify the Guarantor 
promptly after any such set-off and application made by such Agent or 
Lender, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the 
validity of such set-off and application. The rights of the Agents and the 
Lenders under this Section 8 are in addition to other rights and remedies

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS OR OTHERWISE PROCEED AGAINST THE GUARANTOR IN ANY OTHER 
JURISDICTION. THE GUARANTOR HEREBY EXPRESSLY AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE 
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY OBJECTION WHICH IT MAY NOW OR 
HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE JURISDICTION OR LAYING OF VENUE OF ANY SUCH 
LITIGATION BROUGHT IN ANY SUCH COURT REFERRED TO ABOVE AND ANY CLAIM THAT

EXECUTION OR OTHERWISE) WITH RESPECT TO HIM OR HIS PROPERTY, THE GUARANTOR 
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES SUCH IMMUNITY IN RESPECT OF HIS OBLIGATIONS UNDER 
THIS GUARANTY AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS.

          SECTION 12. Miscellaneous.

          (a) The Guarantor will make each payment hereunder in lawful 
money of the United States of America and in immediately available funds to 
the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders, at such address 
specified by the Collateral Agent from time to time by notice to the 
Guarantor.

          (b) No amendment of any provision of this Guaranty shall be 
effective unless it is in writing and signed by the Guarantor and the 
Collateral Agent, and no waiver of any provision of this Guaranty, and no 
consent to any departure by the Guarantor therefrom, shall in any event be 
effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Guarantor 
and the Collateral Agent, and then such waiver or consent shall be 
effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for 
which given.

          (c) No failure on the part of any Agent or any Lender to 
exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right hereunder or under any 
other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single 
or partial exercise of any right hereunder or under any other Loan Document 
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other 
right. The rights and remedies of the Agents and the Lenders provided 
herein and in the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are in addition 
to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies provided by law. The 
rights of the Agents and the Lenders under any Loan Document against any 
party thereto are not conditional or contingent on any attempt by the 
Agents and the Lenders to exercise any of their rights under any other Loan 
Document against such party or against any other Person.

          (d) Any provision of this Guaranty which is prohibited or 
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be 
ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without 
invalidating the remaining portions hereof or thereof or affecting the 
validity or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction.

          (e) This Guaranty shall (i) be binding on the Guarantor and his 
heirs, executors, administrators, legal representatives, successors and 
assigns, and (ii) inure, together with all rights and remedies of the 
Agents and the Lenders hereunder, to the benefit of the Agents and the 
Lenders and their respective successors, transferees and assigns. Without 
limiting the generality of clause (ii) of the immediately preceding 
sentence, to the extent permitted by Section 12.07 of the Financing 
Agreement, any Lender may assign or otherwise transfer its rights under the 
Financing Agreement or any other Loan Document to any other Person, and 
such other Person shall thereupon become vested with all of the benefits in 
respect thereof granted to the Lenders herein or otherwise. The Guarantor 
agrees that each participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 8 
with respect to its participation in any portion of the Loans as if it was 
a Lender. None of the rights or obligations of the Guarantor hereunder may 
be assigned or otherwise transferred without the prior written consent of 
the Collateral Agent.

          (f) This Guaranty and the other Loan Documents reflect the entire 
understanding of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and shall 
not be contradicted or qualified by any other agreement, oral or written, 
before the date hereof.

Agent and collectively, the Agents) are parties to a Financing 
Agreement, dated as of February ___, 2009 (such agreement, as amended, 
restated or otherwise modified from time to time, being hereinafter 
referred to as the Financing Agreement);

          WHEREAS, pursuant to the Financing Agreement the Lenders have 
agreed to make term loans (each a Loan and collectively, the Loans) to

not to exceed the Total Term Loan Commitment (as defined in the Financing 
Agreement);

          WHEREAS, the Pledgor owns 100% of the Equity Interests (as 
defined in the Financing Agreement) of the Borrower, as set forth in 
Schedule I hereto;

          WHEREAS, it is a condition precedent to the Lenders making any

          WHEREAS, the Pledgor has determined that the execution, delivery

Borrower of its other obligations now or hereafter existing in respect of 
the Loan Documents (the Obligations), and (ii) agrees to pay any and all

Agents and the Lenders in enforcing any rights under this Agreement.

               (b) The security interest created hereby in the Pledged 
Collateral constitutes continuing collateral security for (x) Obligations

               (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in 
this Agreement, the recourse of the Agent and the Lenders with respect to 
the liability of the Pledgor under this Agreement solely with respect to 
the Obligations shall be limited to the Pledged Collateral.

               SECTION 4. Delivery of the Pledged Collateral.

               (a) (i) All certificates currently representing the Pledged 
Shares shall be delivered to the Collateral Agent contemporaneously with or 
prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement. All other 
certificates and instruments constituting Pledged Collateral from time to 
time or required to be pledged to the Collateral Agent, pursuant to the 
terms of this Agreement or the Financing Agreement (the Additional 
Collateral), shall be delivered to the Collateral Agent promptly upon 
receipt thereof by or on behalf of the Pledgor. All such certificates and 
instruments shall be held by or on behalf of the Collateral Agent pursuant 
hereto and shall be delivered in suitable form for transfer by delivery or 
shall be accompanied by duly executed instruments of transfer or assignment 
or undated stock powers executed in blank, all in form and substance 
reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Agent. If any Pledged Collateral 
consists of uncertificated securities, unless the immediately following 
sentence is applicable thereto, the Pledgor shall cause the Collateral 
Agent (or its designated custodian or nominee) to become the registered 
holder thereof, or cause each issuer of such securities to agree that it 
will comply with instructions originated by the Collateral Agent with 
respect to such securities without further consent by the Pledgor. If any 
Pledged Collateral consists of security entitlements, the Pledgor shall 
transfer such security entitlements to the Collateral Agent (or its 
custodian, nominee or other designee), or cause the applicable securities 
intermediary to agree that it will comply with entitlement orders by the 
Collateral Agent without further consent by the Pledgor.

                    (ii) Within five (5) days of the receipt by the Pledgor 
of any Additional Collateral, a Pledge Amendment, duly executed by the 
Pledgor, in substantially the form of Annex I hereto (a Pledge Amendment
) shall be delivered to the Collateral Agent, in respect of the Additional 
Collateral which must be pledged pursuant to this Agreement and the 
Financing Agreement. The Pledge Amendment shall from and after delivery 
thereof constitute part of Schedule I hereto. The Pledgor hereby authorizes 
the Collateral Agent to attach each Pledge Amendment to this Agreement and 
agrees that all certificates or instruments listed on any Pledge Amendment 
delivered to the Collateral Agent shall for all purposes hereunder 
constitute Pledged Collateral and such Pledgor shall be deemed upon 
delivery thereof to have made the

representations and warranties set forth in Section 5 hereof with respect 
to such Additional Collateral.

               (b) If the Pledgor shall receive, by virtue of the Pledgors 
being or having been an owner of any Pledged Collateral, any (i) stock 
certificate (including, without limitation, any certificate representing a 
stock dividend or distribution in connection with any increase or reduction 
of capital, reclassification, merger, consolidation, sale of assets, 
combination of shares, stock split, spin-off or split-off) or other 
instrument, (ii) option or right, whether as an addition to, substitution

dividends payable in cash (except such dividends permitted to be retained 
by any such Pledgor pursuant to Section 7 hereof) or in securities or other 
property or (iv) dividends or other distributions in connection with a 
partial or total liquidation or dissolution or in connection with a 
reduction of capital, capital surplus or paid-in surplus, the Pledgor shall 
receive such stock certificate, instrument, option, right, payment or 
distribution constituting certificated Pledged Collateral in trust for the 
benefit of the Collateral Agent, shall segregate it from such Pledgors 
other property and shall deliver it forthwith to the Collateral Agent, in 
the exact form received, with any necessary endorsement and/or appropriate 
stock powers duly executed in blank, to be held by the Collateral Agent as 
Pledged Collateral and as further collateral security for the Obligations.

          SECTION 5. Representations and Warranties. The Pledgor represents

its certificate of formation, operating agreement, any Requirements of Law 
or any contractual restriction binding on or affecting it or any of its 
properties, (ii) do not and will not result in or require the creation of

               (d) The Pledged Shares have been duly authorized and validly

of stock constituting Pledged Collateral will be duly authorized and 
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.

               (e) The Pledgor is and will be at all times the legal and 
beneficial owner of the Pledged Collateral free and clear of all Liens 
except for the Lien created by this Agreement.

               (f) The exercise by the Collateral Agent of any of its 
rights and remedies hereunder will not contravene any law or any 
contractual restriction binding on or affecting the Pledgor or any of the 
properties of the Pledgor and will not result in or require the creation of 
any Lien upon or with respect to any of the properties of the Pledgor other 
than pursuant to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents.

               (g) No authorization or approval or other action by, and no 
notice to or filing with, any Governmental Authority is required to be 
obtained or made by the Pledgor for (i) the due execution, delivery and 
performance by the Pledgor of this Agreement, (ii) the grant by the 
Pledgor, or the perfection, of the Lien created hereby in the Pledged 
Collateral, except for the filing in the office described in Schedule III 
hereto of a UCC financing statement naming the Pledgor as debtor, the 
Collateral Agent as secured party and describing the Pledged Collateral, to

Collateral in which such security interests are not susceptible to 
perfection by possession of certificates or instruments, which financing 
statement has been duly filed or (iii) the exercise by the Collateral Agent

               (i) This Agreement creates a valid Lien in favor of the 
Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Agents and the Lenders, in the 
Pledged Collateral as security for the Obligations. The Collateral Agents 
having possession of the certificates representing the Pledged Shares and 
all other certificates, instruments and cash constituting Pledged 
Collateral from time to time results in the perfection of such Lien. Such 
Lien is, or in the case of Pledged Collateral in which the Pledgor obtains 
rights after the date hereof, will be, a perfected, first priority Lien. 
All action necessary or desirable to perfect and protect such Lien has been 
duly taken, except for the Collateral Agents having possession of 
certificates, instruments and cash constituting Pledged Collateral after 
the date hereof.

               (j) The partnership interests or membership interests of 
each Pledged Issuer are (i) securities for purposes of Article 8 of the 
UCC, (iii) investment company securities within the meaning of Section 
8-103 of the UCC and (iii) evidenced by a certificate.

               (k) The pledge of the Pledged Collateral pursuant to this 
Agreement does not violate Regulation T, U or X of the Board of Governors 
of the Federal Reserve System.

other consensual rights pertaining to any Pledged Collateral for any 
purpose not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, the Financing 
Agreement or the other Loan Documents; provided, however, that (A) the 
Pledgor will not exercise or will refrain from exercising any such right, 
as the case may be, if the Collateral Agent gives the Pledgor notice that,

likely to have a material adverse effect to the Pledgors financial 
condition and (B) the Pledgor will give the Collateral Agent at least five 
(5) Business Days notice of the manner in which it intends to exercise, or 
the reasons for refraining from exercising, any such right which is

financial condition;

                    (ii) the Pledgor may receive and retain any and all

receive and retain pursuant to Section 7(a)(ii) hereof, shall cease, and 
all such rights shall thereupon become vested in the Collateral Agent which 
shall thereupon have the sole right to exercise such voting and other 
consensual rights and to receive and hold as Pledged Collateral such 
dividends and interest payments;

                    (ii) without limiting the generality of the foregoing, 
the Collateral Agent may, at its option exercise any and all rights of 
conversion, exchange, subscription or any other rights, privileges or 
options pertaining to any of the Pledged Collateral as if it were the 
absolute owner thereof, including, without limitation, the right to 
exchange, in its discretion, any and all of the Pledged Collateral upon the

for the purpose of taking any action which the Agent may deem necessary or 
advisable to accomplish the purposes of this Agreement, the Pledgor (i) 
authorizes the Collateral Agent to execute any such agreements, instruments 
or other documents in the Pledgors name and to file such agreements,

Agent as the Pledgors attorney-in-fact and proxy, with full authority in 
the place and stead of the Pledgor and in the name of the Pledgor or 
otherwise, from time to time in the Collateral Agents discretion, to take 
any action and to execute any instrument which the Collateral Agent may 
deem necessary or advisable to accomplish the purposes of this Agreement 
(subject to the rights of the Pledgor under Section 7(a) hereof), 
including, without limitation, to receive, endorse and collect all 
instruments made payable to the Pledgor representing any dividend, 
interest, distribution or other payment in respect of any Pledged 
Collateral and to give full discharge for the same. This power is coupled 
with an interest and is irrevocable until all of the Obligations are 
indefeasibly paid in full after all Commitments have been terminated.

               (c) If the Pledgor fails to perform any agreement or 
obligation contained herein, the Collateral Agent itself may perform, or 
cause performance of, such agreement or obligation, and the expenses of the 
Collateral Agent incurred in connection therewith shall be payable by the 
Pledgor pursuant to Section 10 hereof and shall be secured by the Pledged 
Collateral.

               (d) Other than the exercise of reasonable care to assure the 
safe custody of the Pledged Collateral while held hereunder, the Collateral 
Agent shall have no duty or liability to preserve rights pertaining thereto 
and shall be relieved of all responsibility for the Pledged Collateral upon 
surrendering it or tendering surrender of it to the Pledgor. The Collateral 
Agent shall be deemed to have exercised reasonable care in the custody and 
preservation of the Pledged Collateral in its possession if the Pledged 
Collateral is accorded treatment substantially equal to that which the 
Collateral Agent accords its own property, it being understood that the 
Collateral Agent shall not have responsibility for (i) ascertaining or 
taking action with respect to calls, conversions, exchanges, maturities, 
tenders or other matters relating to any Pledged Collateral, whether or not 
the Collateral Agent has or is deemed to have knowledge of such matters, or 
(ii) taking any necessary steps to preserve rights against any parties with 
respect to any Pledged Collateral.

               (e) The powers conferred on the Collateral Agent hereunder 
are solely to protect its interest in the Pledged Collateral and shall not 
impose any duty upon the Collateral Agent to exercise any such powers. 
Except for the safe custody of any Pledged Collateral in its possession and 
the accounting for monies actually received by it hereunder, the Collateral 
Agent shall have no duty as to any Pledged Collateral or as to the taking 
of any necessary steps to preserve rights against prior parties or any 
other rights pertaining to any Pledged Collateral.

               (f) The Collateral Agent may at any time in its discretion 
(i) without notice to the Pledgor, transfer or register in the name of the 
Collateral Agent or any of its nominees any or all of the Pledged 
Collateral, subject only to the revocable rights of such Pledgor under 
Section 7(a) hereof, and (ii) exchange certificates or instruments 
constituting Pledged Collateral for certificates or instruments of smaller 
or larger denominations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

          SECTION 9. Remedies Upon Default. If any Event of Default shall 
have occurred and be continuing:

               (a) The Collateral Agent may exercise in respect of the 
Pledged Collateral, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided 
for herein or otherwise available to it, all of the rights and remedies of 
a secured party upon default under the Code then in effect in the State of 
New York; and without limiting the generality of the foregoing and without 
notice except as specified below, sell the Pledged Collateral or any part 
thereof in one or more parcels at public or private sale, at any exchange 
or brokers board or elsewhere, at such price or prices and on such other 
terms as the Collateral Agent may deem commercially reasonable. The Pledgor 
agrees that, to the extent notice of sale shall be required by law, at 
least five (5) days notice to the Pledgor of the time and place of any 
public sale of Pledged Collateral owned by the Pledgor or the time after 
which any private sale is to be made shall constitute reasonable 
notification. The Collateral Agent shall not be obligated to make any sale 
of Pledged Collateral regardless of whether or not notice of sale has been 
given. The Collateral Agent may adjourn any public or private sale from 
time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed therefor, and such 
sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which it 
was so adjourned.

               (b) In the event that the Collateral Agent determines to 
exercise its right to sell all or any part of the Pledged Collateral 
pursuant to Section 9(a) hereof, the Pledgor will, upon request by the 
Collateral Agent: (i) execute and deliver, and vote in favor of causing the 
issuer of the Pledged Collateral and the directors and officers thereof to 
execute and deliver, all such instruments and documents, and do or cause to 
be done all such other acts and things, as may be necessary or, in the 
opinion of the Collateral Agent, advisable to register the Pledged 
Collateral under the provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended 
(the Securities Act), and to cause the registration statement relating 
thereto to become effective and to remain effective for such period as 
prospectuses are required by law to be furnished, and to make all 
amendments and supplements thereto and to the related prospectus which, in 
the opinion of the Collateral Agent, are necessary or advisable, all in 
conformity with the requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and 
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission applicable thereto, 
(ii) vote in favor of causing the issuer of the Pledged Collateral to 
qualify the Pledged Collateral under the state securities or Blue Sky 
laws of each jurisdiction, and to obtain all necessary governmental 
approvals for the sale of the Pledged Collateral, as requested by the 
Collateral Agent, (iii) vote in favor of causing each Pledged Issuer to 
make available to its securityholders, as soon as practicable, an earnings 
statement which will satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the 
Securities Act, and (iv) do or cause to be done all such other acts and 
things within its power as may be necessary to make such sale of the 
Pledged Collateral valid and binding and in compliance with any applicable 
law.

               (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 9(b) hereof, 
the Pledgor recognizes that the Collateral Agent may deem it impracticable 
to effect a public sale of all or any part of the Pledged Shares or any 
other securities constituting Pledged Collateral and that the Collateral 
Agent may, therefore, determine to make one or more private sales of any 
such securities to a restricted group of purchasers who will be obligated 
to agree, among other things, to acquire such securities for their own 
account, for investment and not with a view to the distribution or resale 
thereof. The Pledgor acknowledges that any such private sale may be at

10

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

prices and on terms less favorable to the seller than the prices and other 
terms which might have been obtained at a public sale and, notwithstanding 
the foregoing, agrees that such private sales shall be deemed to have been 
made in a commercially reasonable manner and that the Collateral Agent 
shall have no obligation to delay the sale of any such securities for the 
period of time necessary to permit the issuer of such securities to 
register such securities for public sale under the Securities Act. The 
Pledgor further acknowledges and agrees that any offer to sell such 
securities which has been (i) publicly advertised on a bona fide basis in a 
newspaper or other publication of general circulation in the financial 
community of New York, New York (to the extent that such an offer may be so 
advertised without prior registration under the Securities Act) or (ii) 
made privately in the manner described above to not less than fifteen bona 
fide offerees shall be deemed to involve a public disposition for the 
purposes of Section 9-610(c) of the Code (or any successor or similar, 
applicable statutory provision) as then in effect in the State of New York, 
notwithstanding that such sale may not constitute a public offering under 
the Securities Act, and that the Collateral Agent may, in such event, bid 
for the purchase of such securities.

               (d) Any cash held by the Collateral Agent as Pledged 
Collateral and all cash proceeds received by the Collateral Agent in 
respect of any sale of, collection from, or other realization upon, all or 
any part of the Pledged Collateral may, in the discretion of the Collateral 
Agent, be held by the Collateral Agent as collateral for, and/or then or at 
any time thereafter applied (after payment of any amounts payable to the 
Collateral Agent pursuant to Section 10 hereof) in whole or in part by the 
Collateral Agent against, all or any part of the Obligations in such order 
as the Collateral Agent shall elect consistent with the provisions of the 
Financing Agreement. Any surplus of such cash or cash proceeds held by the 
Collateral Agent and remaining after indefeasible payment in full of all of 
the Obligations after all Commitments have been terminated shall be paid 
over to the Pledgor or to such Person as may be lawfully entitled to 
receive such surplus.

               (e) In the event that the proceeds of any such sale, 
collection or realization are insufficient to pay all amounts to which the 
Agents and the Lenders are legally entitled, the Pledgor shall be liable 
for the deficiency, together with interest thereon at the highest rate 
specified in the Financing Agreement for interest on overdue principal 
thereof or such other rate as shall be fixed by applicable law, together 
with the costs of collection and the fees, costs and expenses and other 
client charges of any attorneys employed by the Collateral Agent to collect 
such deficiency.

          SECTION 10. Indemnity and Expenses.

               (a) The Pledgor agrees to defend, protect, indemnify and 
hold harmless each Agent and each Lender (and all of their respective 
officers, directors, employees, attorneys, consultants and agents) from and 
against any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities obligations, 
penalties, fees, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, legal 
fees, costs and expenses of counsel) to the extent that they arise out of 
or otherwise result from the enforcement of this Agreement, except, as to 
any such indemnified Person, claims, losses or liabilities resulting solely 
and directly from such Persons gross negligence or willful misconduct as 
determined by a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.

11

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

               (b) The Pledgor agrees to pay to the Collateral Agent upon 
demand the amount of any and all costs and expenses, including the fees, 
costs, expenses and disbursements of the Collateral Agents counsel and of 
any experts and agents, which the Collateral Agent may incur in connection 
with (i) the amendment, waiver or other modification or termination of this 
Agreement, (ii) the custody, preservation, use or operation of, or the sale 
of, collection from, or other realization upon, any Pledged Collateral, 
(iii) the exercise or enforcement of any of the rights of the Collateral 
Agent hereunder, or (iv) the failure by the Pledgor to perform or observe 
any of the provisions hereof.

          SECTION 11. Notices, Etc. All notices and other communications 
provided for hereunder shall be in writing and shall be mailed (by 
certified mail, postage prepaid and return receipt requested), telecopied 
or delivered, if to the Pledgor, to the Pledgor as specified next to such 
Pledgors signature below; if to the Borrower, at its address specified in 
Section 12.01 of the Financing Agreement; or if to the Collateral Agent, to 
it at its address specified in Section 12.01 of the Financing Agreement; or 
as to any such Person at such other address as shall be designated by such 
Person in a written notice to such other Person complying as to delivery 
with the terms of this Section 11. All such notices and other 
communications shall be effective (i) if mailed (certified mail, postage 
prepaid and return receipt requested), when received or three (3) days 
after deposited in the mails, whichever occurs first, (ii) if telecopied, 
when transmitted and confirmation received, or (iii) if delivered by hand, 
Federal Express or other reputable overnight courier, upon delivery.

          SECTION 12. Security Interest Absolute. All rights of the Agents 
and the Lenders, all Liens and all obligations of the Pledgor hereunder 
shall be absolute and unconditional irrespective of: (i) any lack of 
validity or enforceability of the Financing Agreement or any other 
agreement or instrument relating thereto, (ii) any change in the time, 
manner or place of payment of, or in any other term in respect of, all or 
any of the Obligations, or any other amendment or waiver of or consent to 
any departure from the Financing Agreement or any other Loan Document, 
(iii) any exchange or release of, or non-perfection of any Lien on any 
Collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to 
departure from any Guaranty, for all or any of the Obligations, or (iv) any 
other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a defense available to, 
or a discharge of, the Pledgor in respect of the Obligations. All 
authorizations and agencies contained herein with respect to any of the 
Pledged Collateral are irrevocable and powers coupled with an interest.

          SECTION 13. Miscellaneous.

               (a) No amendment of any provision of this Agreement shall be 
effective unless it is in writing and signed by the Collateral Agent, and 
no waiver of any provision of this Agreement, and no consent to any 
departure the Pledgor therefrom, shall be effective unless it is in writing 
and signed by the Collateral Agent, and then such waiver or consent shall 
be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for 
which given.

               (b) No failure on the part of any Agent or any Lender to 
exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right hereunder or under any Loan 
Document shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial 
exercise of any such right preclude any other or

12

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right. The rights and 
remedies of the Agents and the Lenders provided herein and in the other 
Loan Documents are cumulative and are in addition to, and not exclusive of, 
any rights or remedies provided by law. The rights of the Agents and the 
Lenders under the applicable Loan Document against any party thereto are 
not conditional or contingent on any attempt by the Agents or the Lenders 
to exercise any of their rights under any other document against such party 
or against any other Person, including but not limited to, the Pledgor.

               (c) Any provision of this Agreement which is prohibited or 
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be 
ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without 
invalidating the remaining portions hereof or thereof or affecting the 
validity or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction.

               (d) This Agreement shall create a continuing security 
interest in and Lien on the Pledged Collateral and shall (i) remain in full 
force and effect until the indefeasible payment in full or release of the 
Obligations after the termination of all of the Commitments and (ii) be 
binding on each Pledgor and, by its acceptance hereof, the Collateral 
Agent, and its respective successors and assigns, and shall inure, together 
with all rights and remedies of the Agents and the Lenders hereunder, to 
the benefit of each of the Agents and the Lenders and their respective 
successors, transferees and assigns. Without limiting the generality of 
clause (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence, without notice to the 
Pledgor, the Agents and the Lenders may assign or otherwise transfer their 
respective rights and obligations under this Agreement and any other Loan 
Document to any other Person, and such other Person shall thereupon become 
vested with all of the benefits in respect thereof granted to the Agents 
and the Lenders herein or otherwise. Upon any such assignment or transfer, 
all references in this Agreement to any such Agent or Lender shall mean the 
assignee of such Agent or Lender. None of the rights or obligations of the 
Pledgor hereunder may be assigned or otherwise transferred without the 
prior written consent of the Collateral Agent, and any such assignment or 
transfer shall be null and void.

               (e) Upon the satisfaction in full of the Obligations after 
the termination of all of the Commitments (i) this Agreement and the 
security interest and Lien created hereby shall terminate and all rights to 
the Pledged Collateral shall revert to the Pledgor, and (ii) the Collateral 
Agent will, upon the Pledgors request and at the Pledgors expense, (A) 
return to the Pledgor such of the Pledged Collateral as shall not have been 
sold or otherwise disposed of or applied pursuant to the terms hereof, and 
(B) execute and deliver to the Pledgor, without recourse, representation or 
warranty, such documents as the Pledgor shall reasonably request to 
evidence such termination.

               (f) This Agreement may be executed in any number of 
counterparts and by the different parties hereto on separate counterparts, 
each of which shall be deemed an original, but all such counterparts shall 
constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart 
of this Agreement by telefacsimile or electronic mail shall be equally as 
effective as delivery of an original executed counterpart of this 
Agreement. Any party delivering an executed counterpart of this Agreement 
by telefacsimile or electronic mail also shall deliver an original executed 
counterpart of this Agreement but the failure to deliver an original 
executed counterpart shall not affect the validity, enforceability, and 
binding effect of this Agreement.

13

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

               (g) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in 
accordance with the law of the State of New York, except as required by 
mandatory provisions of law and except to the extent that the validity and 
perfection or the perfection and the effect of perfection or non-perfection 
of the security interest and Lien created hereby, or remedies hereunder, in 
respect of any particular Pledged Collateral are governed by the law of a 
jurisdiction other than the State of New York.

               (h) ANY LEGAL ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING WITH RESPECT TO 
THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY DOCUMENT RELATED THERETO MAY BE BROUGHT IN THE COURTS 
OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK IN THE COUNTY OF NEW YORK OR THE UNITED STATES OF 
AMERICA FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK, AND APPELLATE COURTS 
THEREOF, AND, BY EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE PLEDGOR 
HEREBY ACCEPTS FOR ITSELF AND IN RESPECT OF ITS PROPERTY, GENERALLY AND 
UNCONDITIONALLY, THE JURISDICTION OF THE AFORESAID COURTS. THE PLEDGOR 
HEREBY EXPRESSLY AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY 
LAW, ANY OBJECTION, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY OBJECTION TO THE 
LAYING OF VENUE OR BASED ON THE GROUNDS OF FORUM NON CONVENIENS, WHICH IT 
MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE BRINGING OF ANY SUCH ACTION, SUIT OR 
PROCEEDING IN SUCH RESPECTIVE JURISDICTIONS AND CONSENTS TO THE GRANTING OF 
SUCH LEGAL OR EQUITABLE RELIEF AS IS DEEMED APPROPRIATE BY THE COURT.

          (i) THE PLEDGOR AND (BY ITS ACCEPTANCE OF THE BENEFITS OF THIS 
AGREEMENT) THE COLLATERAL AGENT WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO TRIAL BY 
JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION BASED ON, ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN 
CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT, OR ANY COURSE OF 
CONDUCT, COURSE OF DEALING, VERBAL OR WRITTEN STATEMENT OR OTHER ACTION OF 
THE PARTIES HERETO.

Insurance Policy;

     B. The Trust is the sole owner and beneficiary of the Life Insurance 
Policy, which the Trust holds pursuant to the terms of the Trust Agreement;

     C. The Beneficiary will derive significant benefits from the loan to 
the Trust under the Loan Agreement by reason of his or her interest in the 
Trust;

     D. In order to induce the Lender to make the advance contemplated by 
the Loan Agreement and extend credit to the Trust as provided in the Loan 
Agreement, the Beneficiary has agreed to grant a security interest in the 
Beneficiarys beneficial interest in the Trust to the Lender in accordance 
with the terms and conditions of this Pledge Agreement.

     NOW, THEREFORE, intending to be legally bound and in consideration of 
the matters described in the foregoing Recitals, which Recitals are 
incorporated herein and made a part hereof, and for other good and valuable 
consideration the receipt and sufficiency of which are acknowledged, 
Beneficiary and Lender hereby covenant and agree as follows:

          1. GRANT OF SECURITY INTEREST. Beneficiary hereby grants, gives, 
conveys and pledges to Lender a first priority security interest in all of 
Beneficiarys right, title and interest whether now owned or hereafter 
acquired and wherever located, in and to the Collateral to secure the 
Obligations and agrees that Lender shall have the rights stated in this 
Pledge Agreement with respect to the Collateral, in addition to all other 
rights that Lender may have by law.

          2. COLLATERAL DESCRIPTION. The word Collateral means all of the 
Beneficiarys right, title and interest in and to the beneficial interests 
in the Trust, the Trust Agreement and the assets held by the Trust under 
the Trust Agreement and any Financing Documents, including without 
limitation the Trusts entire beneficial interest in and to the Life 
Insurance Policy and the death benefits payable thereunder, and all 
proceeds of all of the foregoing.

          3. BENEFICIARYS REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO 
THE COLLATERAL. With respect to the Collateral, Beneficiary represents and 
warrants to Lender that:

 

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

               a. Ownership. On and after the Initial Premium Funding Date, 
the Beneficiary has, and will do nothing to impair, full, complete and 
absolute ownership of the Collateral and all rights thereunder free and 
clear of any Encumbrances, options, purchase rights or commitments of any 
kind except as otherwise contemplated by the Financing Documents. Under the 
terms of the Trust, the Beneficiary has, and shall do nothing to impair, 
the sole and absolute right, subject to the terms of the Financing 
Documents, to pledge or assign such beneficial interests as collateral and 
receive all proceeds and other amounts now or in the future due and payable 
in respect to the Collateral. On and after the Initial Premium Funding 
Date, Beneficiary has not taken and shall not take, any actions to provide 
any Person other than the Beneficiary any interest in or claim to the 
Collateral other than as expressly provided in the Financing Documents.

               b. Right to Grant Security Interest. Beneficiary has the 
full right, power and authority to enter into this Pledge Agreement and to 
grant a security interest, assignment and pledge of the Collateral to 
Lender as provided herein, and this Pledge Agreement and the security 
interest created by Beneficiary hereunder does not violate or breach, or 
result in the creation of an Encumbrance under, the Trust Agreement or any 
other document, instrument, mortgage or agreement to which Beneficiary is a 
party or to which its assets are bound.

               c. Trust Agreement. A true and correct copy of the Trust 
Agreement, including all amendments, supplements and other modifications 
thereto, has been previously delivered by Trust to Lender. The Trust 
Agreement is a legal, valid and binding agreement, enforceable by 
Beneficiary in accordance with its terms.

               d. Consents. No consent, approval, authorization or other 
order or other action by, and no notice to or filing with, the trustee of 
the Trust or any other person is required (i) for the grant of the security 
interest by Beneficiary in the Collateral pursuant to this Pledge Agreement 
or for the execution, delivery or performance of this Pledge Agreement by 
Beneficiary, or (ii) for the exercise by Lender of any of its rights 
provided for in this Pledge Agreement or the remedies in respect of the 
Collateral pursuant to this Pledge Agreement.

               e. Due Authorization, Execution and Delivery; Valid and 
Binding Obligation. This Pledge Agreement has been duly authorized, 
executed and delivered by Beneficiary and constitutes a legal, valid and 
binding obligation of Beneficiary enforceable by Lender against Beneficiary 
in accordance with its terms.

               f. No Prior Assignment. Beneficiary has not previously 
granted a security interest in any of the Collateral to any other creditor 
or other person.

               g. No Further Transfer. Beneficiary shall not sell, assign, 
encumber, or otherwise dispose of any of Beneficiarys rights in the 
Collateral except as expressly provided in this Pledge Agreement.

               h. No Defaults. There are no defaults relating to the 
Collateral, and there are no offsets or counterclaims to the same. 
Beneficiary will strictly and promptly do everything required of 
Beneficiary under the terms, conditions, promises, and agreements contained 
in or relating to the Collateral.

2

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

               i. Proceeds. Any and all replacement or renewal 
certificates, instruments, or other benefits or proceeds related to the 
Collateral that are received by Beneficiary shall be held by Beneficiary in 
trust for Lender and immediately shall be delivered by Beneficiary to 
Lender to be held as part of the Collateral.

               j. Location. Beneficiarys primary office and principal 
place of business or residence if an individual and the place where 
Beneficiary keeps Beneficiarys records concerning the Collateral are 
located at the address set forth in Section 9(i) below. If Beneficiary 
changes Beneficiarys name or address, or the name or address of any person 
granting a security interest under this Pledge Agreement changes, 
Beneficiary will promptly notify the Lender of such change, but in no event 
later than thirty (30) days following such change.

               k. Further Acts. Beneficiary will, at its sole expense, 
promptly execute, acknowledge and deliver all such instruments and take all 
such actions as Lender from time to time may request in order to ensure to 
Lender the benefits of its lien in and to the Collateral intended to be 
created by this Pledge Agreement, including the filing of any necessary 
financing statements or continuation statements, which may be filed by 
Lender with or (to the extent permitted by law) without the signature of 
Beneficiary, and will cooperate with Lender, at Beneficiarys expense, in 
obtaining all necessary approvals and making all necessary filings under 
federal, state, local or foreign law in connection with such lien or any 
sale or transfer of the Collateral.

          4. PERFECTION AND PROTECTION OF SECURITY. The Beneficiary makes 
the following representations, warranties and covenants to the Lender from 
the Execution Date until the Obligations are paid in full:

               a. (i) The pledgors right, title and interest in any 
Collateral is and shall be free from any Encumbrance except for the 
security interest and lien created hereby and pursuant to the other 
Financing Documents; and

                    (ii) The Pledgor shall not sell or otherwise dispose 
of, or pledge, mortgage or create, or suffer to exist a lien on, the 
Collateral in favor of any person other than the Lender (except as 
permitted in the Loan Agreement).

               b. The Beneficiary authorizes the Lender to file financing 
statements relating to the Collateral under the Uniform Commercial Code 
(UCC) containing the information set forth on Schedule B hereto in the 
jurisdictions indicated in this Pledge Agreement or as otherwise determined 
by the Lender. Subject to the filing of continuation statements in respect 
of such financing statements required from time to time under the UCC, (i) 
the security interest in the Collateral, to the extent the same can be 
perfected by filing of financing statements under the UCC, constitutes and 
will constitute a perfected first priority security interest therein, 
subject to no other Encumbrance which is perfected by filing of financing 
statements, and (ii) subject further to the Lenders obtaining and 
maintaining possession or control over Collateral as to which a security 
interest can be perfected by possession or control under the UCC, the 
security interest in the Collateral, to the extent the same can be 
perfected under the UCC, constitutes and will constitute a perfected first 
priority security

3

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

interest therein, subject to no other Encumbrance; provided that 
continuation of such security interest in the proceeds of the Collateral is 
limited by the provisions of Sections 9-203, 9-315 and 9-322 of the UCC.

               c. There is no financing statement naming the Beneficiary or 
any of its predecessors in interest as debtor now on file or registered in 
any public office evidencing any Encumbrance on the Collateral, or intended 
so to be and the Beneficiary (including any of its predecessors in 
interest) has not filed or authorized the filing of, any financing 
statement relating to any of its right, title or interest in or to any of 
the Collateral, except financing statements filed or to be filed in respect 
of and covering the security interest and lien of the Lender granted and 
provided for in this Pledge Agreement and the other Financing Documents.

               d. The Beneficiary shall cause the Trust to annotate its 
books and records to reflect the pledge of the beneficial interests in the 
Trust effected by this Pledge Agreement.

               e. The Beneficiary shall ensure at all times that the Lender 
has control for purposes of Section 8-106 of the UCC of all 
uncertificated instruments included within the Collateral. The Beneficiary 
has caused the Trust to execute and deliver to the Lender on the date of 
this Pledge Agreement a consent in the form attached hereto as Schedule C 
in order to comply with the requirements of Section 8-106(c)(2) of the UCC 
to the extent beneficial interests in the Trust constitute uncertificated 
securities for purposes of Article 8 of the UCC.

          5. LENDERS RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE 
COLLATERAL.

               a. While this Pledge Agreement is in effect, Lender shall 
retain all of Beneficiarys rights, title and interest in the Collateral, 
together with any and all evidence of the Collateral, and this Pledge 
Agreement will remain in effect until (a) there no longer is any 
Obligations owing to Lender; and (b) all other obligations secured by this 
Pledge Agreement have been fulfilled. In furtherance of the foregoing, the 
Beneficiary shall execute an Assignment of Beneficial Interests in the form 
attached hereto as Schedule D contemporaneously with the execution of this 
Pledge Agreement.

               b. Notwithstanding Section 4(a) above, so long as no Event 
of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Beneficiary shall be 
entitled:

                    (i) to exercise, as it shall think fit, but in a manner 
not inconsistent with the terms hereof and the terms of the other Financing 
Documents, any voting power with respect to the Collateral, and for that 
purpose the Lender shall (if any securities pledged under this Agreement 
(each, a Pledged Security) shall be registered in the name of the Lender 
or its nominee) execute or cause to be executed from time to time, at the 
expense of the Beneficiary, such proxies or other instruments in favor of 
the Beneficiary or its nominee, in such form and for such purposes as shall 
be reasonably required by the Beneficiary and shall be specified in a 
written request therefor, to enable it to exercise such voting power with 
respect to such Pledged Security; and

4

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

                    (ii) except as otherwise provided in Sections 4(c) and 
4(d) hereof, to receive and retain for its own account any and all 
payments, proceeds, dividends, distributions, monies, compensation, 
property, assets, instruments or rights to the extent such are permitted 
pursuant to the terms of the Loan Agreement, other than (x) stock or 
liquidating dividends or (y) extraordinary dividends and dividends or other 
amounts payable under or in connection with any recapitalization, 
restructuring, or other non ordinary course event (the dividends and 
amounts in this clause (y) being Extraordinary Payments), paid, issued or 
distributed from time to time in respect of the Collateral.

               c. Extraordinary Payments and Distributions.

                    (i) In case, upon the dissolution or liquidation (in 
whole or in part) of any issuer of any Collateral, any sum shall be paid or 
payable as a liquidating dividend or otherwise upon or with respect to any 
Pledged Security or, in the event any other Extraordinary Payment is paid 
or payable, then and in any such event, such sum or Extraordinary Payment 
shall be paid by the Beneficiary over to the Lender promptly, and in any 
event within ten (10) days after receipt thereof, to be held by the Lender 
as additional collateral hereunder.

                    (ii) In case any stock dividend shall be declared with 
respect to any Pledged Security, or any shares of stock or fractions 
thereof shall be issued pursuant to any stock split involving any Pledged 
Security, or any distribution of capital shall be made on any of the 
Collateral, or any shares, obligations or other property shall be 
distributed upon or with respect to the Collateral, in each case pursuant 
to a recapitalization or reclassification of the capital of the issuer 
thereof, or pursuant to the dissolution, liquidation (in whole or in part), 
bankruptcy or reorganization of such issuer, or to the merger or 
consolidation of such issuer with or into another corporation, the shares, 
obligations, capital or other property so distributed shall be delivered by 
the Beneficiary to the Lender promptly, and in any event within ten (10) 
days after receipt thereof, to be held by the Lender as additional 
collateral hereunder subject to the terms of this Pledge Agreement, and all 
of the same shall constitute Collateral for all purposes hereof.

               d. Voting Rights and Ordinary Payments After an Event of 
Default. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of 
Default, all rights of the Beneficiary to exercise or refrain from 
exercising the voting and other consensual rights that it would otherwise 
be entitled to exercise pursuant to Section 4(b)(i) hereof and to receive 
the payments, proceeds, dividends, distributions, monies, compensation, 
property, assets, instruments or rights that the Beneficiary would 
otherwise be authorized to receive and retain pursuant to Section 4(b)(ii) 
hereof shall cease, and thereupon the Lender shall be entitled to exercise 
all voting power with respect to any Pledged Security and to receive and 
retain, as additional collateral hereunder, any and all payments, proceeds, 
dividends, distributions, monies, compensation, property, assets, 
instruments or rights at any time declared or paid upon any of the 
Collateral during such an Event of Default and otherwise to act with 
respect to the Collateral as outright owner thereof.

               e. All Payments in Trust. All payments, proceeds, dividends, 
distributions, monies, compensation, property, assets, instruments or 
rights that are received by the Beneficiary contrary to the provisions of 
Section 4 hereof shall be received and held in trust

5

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

for the benefit of the Lender, shall be segregated by the Beneficiary from 
other funds of the Beneficiary and shall be forthwith paid over to the 
Lender as Collateral in the same form as so received (with any necessary 
endorsement).

          6. LENDERS EXPENDITURES. If any action or proceeding is 
commenced that would materially affect Lenders interest in the Collateral 
or if Beneficiary fails to comply with any provision of this Pledge 
Agreement or any Financing Documents, including but not limited to 
Beneficiarys failure to discharge or pay when due any amounts Beneficiary 
is required to discharge or pay under this Pledge Agreement or any 
Financing Documents, Lender on Beneficiarys behalf may (but shall not be 
obligated to) take any action that Lender deems appropriate, including but 
not limited to discharging or paying all taxes, liens, security interests, 
encumbrances and other claims, at any time levied or placed on the 
Collateral and paying all costs for insuring, maintaining and preserving 
the Collateral. All such expenditures incurred or paid by Lender for such 
purposes will then bear interest at the Interest Rate from the date 
incurred or paid by Lender to the date of repayment by Trust. All such 
expenses will become a part of the Obligations and, at Lenders option, 
will (A) be payable on demand; (B) be added to the Total Amount Due and be 
apportioned among and be payable with any installment payments to become 
due during either (1) the term of any applicable insurance Life Insurance 
Policy; or (2) the remaining term of the Loan Agreement; or (C) be treated 
as a balloon payment which will be due and payable at the Maturity Date. 
The liens created under this Pledge Agreement also will secure payment of 
these amounts. Such right shall be in addition to all other rights and 
remedies to which Lender may be entitled upon an Event of Default.

          7. LIMITATIONS ON OBLIGATIONS OF LENDER. Lender shall use 
ordinary reasonable care in the physical preservation and custody of the 
Collateral to the extent in the possession of the Lender but shall have no 
other obligation to protect the Collateral or its value. In particular, but 
without limitation, Lender shall have no responsibility (A) for the 
collection or protection of any income on the Collateral (other than any 
death benefits paid or payable under the Life Insurance Policy and any 
interest or payments in the nature of interest which may be paid or become 
due in respect thereto); (B) for the preservation of rights against issuers 
of the Collateral or against third persons (other than the Insurer); (C) 
for ascertaining any maturities, conversions, exchanges, offers, tenders, 
or similar matters relating to the Collateral other than the Life Insurance 
Policy; nor (D) for informing the Beneficiary about any of the above, 
whether or not Lender has or is deemed to have knowledge of such matters.

          8. RIGHTS AND REMEDIES ON DEFAULT. Upon the occurrence of an 
Event of Default, or at any time thereafter, Lender may exercise any one or 
more of the following rights and remedies in respect of the Collateral, in 
addition to any rights or remedies that may be available at law, in equity, 
or otherwise:

               a. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any 
Event of Default, the Lender may exercise, in addition to other rights and 
remedies provided for herein or otherwise available to it, all rights of 
voting, exercise and conversion with respect to the Collateral and all of 
the rights and remedies of a collateral agent on default under the UCC at 
that time (whether or not applicable to the affected Collateral) and may 
also, without obligation to resort to other security, at any time and from 
time to time sell, resell, assign and deliver, in its sole discretion, all 
or any of the Collateral, in one or more parcels at the same or different 
times,

6

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

and all right, title and interest, claim and demand therein and right of 
redemption thereof, on any securities exchange on which any Collateral may 
be listed, or at public or private sale, for cash, upon credit or for 
future delivery, and in connection therewith the Lender may grant options.

               b. If any of the Collateral is sold upon credit or for 
future delivery, the Lender shall not be liable for the failure of the 
purchaser to purchase or pay for the same and, in the event of any such 
failure, the Lender may resell such Collateral. In no event shall the 
Beneficiary be credited with any part of the proceeds of sale of any 
Collateral until cash payment therefor has actually been received by the 
Lender.

               c. The Lender may purchase any Collateral at any public sale 
and, if any Collateral is of a type customarily sold in a recognized market 
or is of the type that is the subject of widely distributed standard price 
quotations, the Lender may purchase such Collateral at private sale, and in 
each case may make payment therefor by any means, including, without 
limitation, by release or discharge of Obligations in lieu of cash payment.

               d. The Beneficiary recognizes that the Lender may be unable 
to effect a public sale of all or part of the Collateral consisting of 
securities by reason of certain prohibitions contained in the Securities 
Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), or in applicable Blue Sky 
or other state securities laws, as now or hereafter in effect, but may be 
compelled to resort to one or more private sales to a restricted group of 
purchasers who will be obliged to agree, among other things, to acquire 
such securities for their own account, for investment and not with a view 
to the distribution or resale thereof. The Beneficiary agrees that any such 
Collateral sold at any such private sale may be sold at a price and upon 
other terms less favorable to the seller than if sold at public sale and 
that each such private sale shall be deemed to have been made in a 
commercially reasonable manner. The Lender shall have no obligation to 
delay the sale of any such securities for the period of time necessary to 
permit the issuer of such securities, even if such issuer would agree, to 
register such securities for public sale under the Securities Act. The 
Beneficiary agrees that private sales made under the foregoing 
circumstances shall be deemed to have been made in a commercially 
reasonable manner.

               e. No demand, advertisement or notice, all of which are 
hereby expressly waived, shall be required in connection with any sale or 
other disposition of any part of the Collateral that threatens to decline 
speedily in value or that is of a type customarily sold on a recognized 
market; otherwise the Lender shall give the Beneficiary at least ten (10) 
days prior notice of the time and place of any public sale and of the time 
after which any private sale or other disposition is to be made, which 
notice the Beneficiary agrees is commercially reasonable.

               f. The Lender shall not be obligated to make any sale of 
Collateral if it shall determine not to do so, regardless of the fact that 
notice of sale may have been given. The Lender may, without notice or 
publication, adjourn any public or private sale or cause the same to be 
adjourned from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed for 
sale, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and 
place to which the same was so adjourned.

7

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

               g. The remedies provided herein in favor of the Lender shall 
not be deemed exclusive, but shall be cumulative, and shall be in addition 
to all other remedies in favor of the Lender existing at law or in equity.

               h. To the extent that applicable law imposes duties on the 
Lender to exercise remedies in a commercially reasonable manner, the 
Beneficiary acknowledges and agrees that it is not commercially 
unreasonable for the Lender (i) to advertise dispositions of Collateral 
through publications or media of general circulation; (ii) to contact other 
persons, whether or not in the same business as the Beneficiary, for 
expressions of interest in acquiring all or any portion of the Collateral; 
(iii) to hire one or more professional auctioneers to assist in the 
disposition of Collateral; (iv) to dispose of Collateral by utilizing 
Internet sites that provide for the auction of assets of the types included 
in the Collateral or that have the reasonable capability of doing so, or 
that match buyers and sellers of assets; (v) to disclaim disposition 
warranties, or (vi) to the extent deemed appropriate by the Lender, to 
obtain the services of brokers, investment bankers, consultants and other 
professionals to assist the Lender in the disposition of any of the 
Collateral. The Beneficiary acknowledges that the purpose of this clause 
(h) is to provide non-exhaustive indications of what actions or omissions 
by the Lender would not be commercially unreasonable in the Lenders 
exercise of remedies against the Collateral and that other actions or 
omissions by the Lender shall not be deemed commercially unreasonable 
solely on account of not being indicated in this clause (h). Without 
limiting the foregoing, nothing contained in this clause (h) shall be 
construed to grant any rights to the Beneficiary or to impose any duties on 
the Lender that would not have been granted or imposed by this Pledge 
Agreement or by applicable law in the absence of this clause (h).

               i. The Lenders prior recourse to any Collateral shall not 
constitute a condition of any demand, suit or proceeding for payment or 
collection of the Obligations.

          9. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS. The following miscellaneous 
provisions are a part of this Pledge Agreement:

               a. Amendments. This Pledge Agreement, together with the Loan 
Agreement, and all Financing Documents, constitutes the entire 
understanding and agreement of the parties as to the matters set forth in 
this Pledge Agreement. No alteration of or amendment to this Pledge 
Agreement shall be effective unless given in writing and signed by the 
party or parties sought to be charged or bound by the alteration or 
amendment.

               b. Arbitration. All controversies or disputes arising out of 
or in connection with this Pledge Agreement (Disputes) shall be resolved 
pursuant to this Section 9a.

                    (i) All Disputes shall in the first instance be 
discussed amicably between the parties with a view to resolving such 
Dispute, commencing upon one party giving other parties written notice of 
such Dispute. In the event that such Dispute is not resolved within thirty 
(30) days after such notice (or such longer period as the parties may agree 
in writing with respect to any such Dispute), any party may submit such 
Dispute to be finally settled by arbitration administered under the 
Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (the 
Rules) by a panel of three arbitrators sitting in [                    
]. One

8

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

arbitrator shall be nominated by the party initiating arbitration at the 
time of the filing of its demand for arbitration, the second arbitrator 
shall be nominated by the opposing party(ies) at the time of the filing of 
its answering statement, and the third arbitrator (who shall act as 
chairman) shall be jointly nominated by party-nominated arbitrators if they 
are able to agree. If the first two party nominated arbitrators are unable 
to agree upon a third within thirty (30) days after the nomination of the 
second, or if either party fails to nominate an arbitrator as set forth 
herein, an arbitrator shall be appointed pursuant to the Rules. The award 
of the arbitrators shall be final and binding upon the parties, and shall 
not be subject to any appeal or review. The parties agree that such award 
may be recognized and enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. The 
parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the federal and 
state courts sitting in [                    ], for the sole purpose of 
enforcing this Pledge Agreement (including, where appropriate, issuing 
injunctive relief), the agreement to arbitrate contained herein and any 
award resulting from arbitration pursuant to this Section and, to the 
fullest extent permitted by law, waive any objection which they may have at 
any time to the laying of venue of any proceedings brought in such court 
and any claim that such proceedings have been brought in an inconvenient 
forum.

                    (ii) The Lender and Beneficiary further agree that no 
claim may be brought as a class action, and that the Lender and Beneficiary 
do not have the right to act, nor shall they attempt to act, as a class 
representative or participate as a member of a class of claimants with 
respect to any claim related to or arising out of this Pledge Agreement. To 
the extent that this arbitration provision is held unenforceable, the 
Lender and Beneficiary: (i) irrevocably submit to the exclusive 
jurisdiction of any federal or state court sitting in [                    
] in respect of any action or proceeding arising under or related to in any 
manner whatsoever this Pledge Agreement or the transactions contemplated 
under this Pledge Agreement, (ii) agree that this Pledge Agreement and the 
transactions contemplated by the Financing Arrangement shall in all 
respects be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the 
State of [                    ] (without reference to conflicts of laws 
provisions) and (iii) HEREBY WAIVE THE RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL 
BY JURY ON ANY CLAIM, COUNTERCLAIM, SETOFF, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF 
ACTION (I) ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR (II) 
IN ANY WAY IN CONNECTION WITH OR PERTAINING OR RELATED TO OR INCIDENTAL TO 
ANY DEALINGS OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT IN CONNECTION WITH THIS 
PLEDGE AGREEMENT, REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, AND CONSENT OR THE 
EXERCISE OF ANY PARTYS RIGHTS AND REMEDIES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR 
OTHERWISE, OR THE CONDUCT OR THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE PARTIES HERETO, IN ALL 
OF THE FOREGOING CASES WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING AND 
WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE. The Parties hereby agree 
and acknowledge that this provision is intended to encompass any dispute 
between any Party to this Pledge Agreement and any interested third party.

                    (iii) In any arbitral proceeding arising under this 
Pledge Agreement, the parties agree that they will engage in cooperative

Agreement, the granting of such consent by Lender in any instance shall not 
constitute continuing consent to subsequent instances where such consent is

any provision of this Pledge Agreement to be illegal, invalid, or 
unenforceable as to any circumstance, that finding shall not make the 
offending provision illegal, invalid, or unenforceable as to any other 
circumstance. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the offending 
provision shall be considered modified so that it becomes legal, valid and 
enforceable; however, if the offending provision cannot be so modified, it 
shall be considered deleted from this Pledge Agreement. Unless otherwise 
required by law, the validity, invalidity, or unenforceability of any 
provision of this Pledge Agreement shall not affect the legality, validity 
or enforceability of any other provision of this Pledge Agreement.

               l. Successors and Assigns. Subject to any limitations stated 
in this Pledge Agreement on transfer of Beneficiarys interest, this Pledge

Agreement and the Obligations by way of forbearance or extension without 
releasing Beneficiary from the obligations of this Pledge Agreement or

pursuant to the terms of the Promissory Note;
 
  	(h) 	  	the Assignor shall not take any action in contravention of the 
Collateral Agents security interest in the Life Policy, or grant or permit 
to exist any Lien on the Life Policy other than the interests granted to 
the Lender and Collateral Agent under this Assignment, the Promissory Note, 
the Loan Agreement and the other Financing Documents.
 
  	(i) 	  	the Assignor shall not, directly or indirectly, by operation of 
law or otherwise, merge, consolidate, or otherwise combine with, any person 
or entity, unless this Assignment and all obligations hereunder are assumed 
by such person or entity pursuant to such merger, consolidation or other 
combination;
 
  	(j) 	  	the Assignor shall comply with and enforce all provisions of its 
Trust Documents;
 
  	(k) 	  	Following an Event of Default (as defined in the Loan

  	(l) 	  	the Assignor shall not take any action under the Life Policy 
without the written consent of the Lender or Collateral Agent, and agrees

Collateral Agent may reasonably request in writing.

7. TERMINATION. Upon the final and irrevocable payment and satisfaction in 
full of all of the Obligations, this Assignment and the security interests 
created hereunder shall automatically terminate.

8. LIMITED POWER OF ATTORNEY; STANDARD OF CARE.

  	(a) 	  	The Assignor hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints the 
Collateral Agent and any officer or agent thereof, with full power of 
substitution, as its true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full irrevocable 
power and authority in the place and stead of such Assignor and in the name 
of such Assignor or in its own name, from time to time at the Collateral 
Agents discretion, for the limited purpose of carrying out the terms of 
this Assignment, to take any and all appropriate action and to execute and 
deliver any and all documents and instruments that the Collateral Agent

7

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

  	  	  	may deem necessary or desirable to accomplish the purposes of this 
Assignment and to effectuate any right assigned to the Collateral Agent 
under this Assignment (including, without limitation, the right to transfer 
or direct the transfer of the Life Policy or the proceeds thereof to the 
Collateral Agent upon the sole signature of the Collateral Agent) or Lender 
under the Promissory Note, as the case may be; provided, however, that 
nothing in this Assignment shall obligate the Collateral Agent to protect 
the interests of the Assignor or any other person or entity in or under the 
Life Policy.

  	(b) 	  	The Assignor hereby ratifies, to the extent permitted by law, 
all that any said attorney shall lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue 
hereof. The power of attorney granted pursuant to this Assignment, being 
coupled with an interest, shall be irrevocable until the Obligations are 
indefeasibly paid in full (in the case of payment obligations) and 
otherwise satisfied and discharged.
 
  	(c) 	  	The powers conferred on the Collateral Agent pursuant to this 
Section 8 are solely to protect the Collateral Agents interests in the 
Life Policy and shall not impose any duty upon the Collateral Agent to 
exercise any such powers. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing herein shall 
obligate the Collateral Agent to take any action with respect to the Life 
Policy, including, without limitation, selling, transferring or disposing 
of the Life Policy, and the Collateral Agent shall have the right to do or 
cause to be done all things necessary, proper or advisable to maintain the 
Life Policy in full force in accordance with its terms.
 
  	(d) 	  	The Collateral Agents sole duty with respect to the Life Policy 
shall be to use reasonable care in the custody and preservation of any 
documents or instruments in the Collateral Agents possession evidencing 
such Life Policy in the same manner as the Collateral Agent deals with 
similar property for its own account. The Collateral Agent shall not be 
responsible to the Assignor except for the Collateral Agents own gross 
negligence or willful misconduct.
 
  	(e) 	  	The Collateral Agent shall not be responsible for filing any 
financing or continuation statements or recording any documents or 
instruments in any public office at any time or times or otherwise 
perfecting or maintaining the perfection of any security interest in the 
Collateral. The Collateral Agent shall not be liable or responsible for any 
loss or diminution in the value of any of the Collateral, by reason of the 
act or omission of any carrier, forwarding agency or other agent or bailee 
selected by the Collateral Agent in good faith. The Collateral Agent shall 
not be responsible for the existence, genuineness or value of any of the 
Collateral or for the validity, perfection, priority or enforceability of 
the liens in any of the Collateral, whether impaired by operation of law or 
by reason of any action or omission to act on its part hereunder, except to 
the extent

8

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

  	  	  	such action or omission constitutes gross negligence, bad faith or 
willful misconduct on the part of the Collateral Agent, for the validity or 
sufficiency of the Collateral or any agreement or assignment contained 
therein or for the payment of taxes, charges, assessments or liens upon the 
Collateral or otherwise as to the maintenance of the Collateral.

9. NO WAIVER. Any forbearance or failure or delay by the Collateral Agent 
in exercising any right, power or remedy hereunder shall not be deemed to 
be a waiver of such right, power or remedy, and any single or partial 
exercise of any right, power or remedy shall not preclude the further 
exercise thereof. The Collateral Agent may take or release other security, 
may release any party primarily or secondarily liable for any of the 
Obligations, may grant extensions, renewals or indulgences with respect to 
the Obligations, or may apply to the Obligations in such order as the 
Collateral Agent shall determine the proceeds of the Life Policy hereby 
assigned or any amount received on account of the Life Policy by the 
exercise of any right permitted under this Assignment, without resorting or 
regard to other security or any guaranty. No waiver of any provision hereof 
shall be effective unless it shall be in writing and signed by the 
Collateral Agent.

10. MISCELLANEOUS.

  	(a) 	  	Counterparts. This Assignment may be executed in any number of 
counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original and together shall 
constitute one and the same instrument.
 
  	(b) 	  	Assignment. This Assignment shall be binding upon the Assignor 
and its successors and assigns and shall inure to the benefit of the 
Collateral Agent and its successors and assigns.
 
  	(c) 	  	Arbitration. Any claims, questions or controversies arising 
under or related to in any manner whatsoever this Assignment or the 
transactions contemplated hereunder including, but not limited to, any 
challenge by the Assignor, the Insured, or the Insureds estate or

be conducted in [TRUST-CITY-STATE]. Each Assignor Party understands that 
claims submitted to arbitration are not heard by a jury and are not subject 
to the rules governing the courts. Each Assignor Party further agrees that 
no claim may be brought as a class action, and that no Assignor Party has 
the right to act, nor shall they attempt to act, as a class

contemplated hereunder shall in all respects be governed by and construed 
in accordance with the laws of the State of [JURISDICTION] (without

governed under the laws of the State of [JURISDICTION]; and (c) HEREBY 
WAIVE THE RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY ON ANY CLAIM, 
COUNTERCLAIM, SETOFF, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION (I) ARISING OUT OF 
OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO THIS ASSIGNMENT OR (II) IN ANY WAY IN CONNECTION 
WITH OR PERTAINING OR RELATED TO OR INCIDENTAL TO ANY DEALINGS OF THE 
PARTIES TO THIS ASSIGNMENT IN CONNECTION WITH THIS ASSIGNMENT OR THE 
EXERCISE OF ANY PARTYS RIGHTS AND REMEDIES UNDER THIS ASSIGNMENT OR 
OTHERWISE, OR THE CONDUCT OR THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE PARTIES HERETO, IN ALL 
OF THE FOREGOING CASES WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING AND

hereby agree and acknowledge that this provision is intended to encompass 
any Dispute between any Assignor Party and any Interested Party. The 
parties hereby expressly agree, and each Interested Party in receipt of 
this Assignment acknowledges that the arbitration provision in this Section 
10(c) shall not apply to the trustee of the Assignor in respect of its 
rights, duties, protections and immunities under the Trust Documents.

  	(d) 	  	Inconvenient Forum. The Assignor hereby irrevocably waives, to 
the fullest extent that it may legally do so, the defense of an 
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any action or proceeding arising 
out of or related to this Assignment or any other Financing Documents. The 
Assignor further agrees that a final judgment in any such action or 
proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions 
by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.

  	(e) 	  	Disclaimers. THE ASSIGNOR ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THE

Premium payments for the Life Insurance Policy, and the Payment Dates with 
respect to such premium payments, are defined and set forth on Schedule A 
attached hereto.

     C. In connection with the Loan Agreement, the Lender and Trust have 
agreed that to the extent that monies advanced under the Loan Agreement are 
to be used to pay Second Year Premiums and Third Year Premiums on the Life 
Insurance Policy, such additional advanced amounts shall be deposited into 
escrow and held therein until needed to pay subsequent premiums that may 
become due under the Life Insurance Policy.

     D. The Lender intends to finance the loans to the Trust in part by an 
affiliate obtaining loans pursuant to that certain Financing Agreement (the 
Financing Agreement), dated as of                     , 2009, among 
Imperial Life Financing II, LLC, a Georgia limited liability company, the 
lenders from time to time party thereto (together with their successors and 
assigns, the Financing Lenders) and CTL Holdings II LLC, as collateral 
agent and administrative agent for the Financing Lenders (together with its 
successors and assigns, the Agent).

     NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and other good and 
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby 
expressly acknowledged, the Trust, Lender and the Escrow Agent hereby agree

the parties hereto that Escrow Agent shall not in any way whatsoever be 
liable for any losses on any investments, including without limitation, 
losses from market risks due to premature liquidation or resulting from 
other actions taken pursuant to and consistent with this Agreement, except 
to the extent that such losses are a result of Escrow Agents fraud, 
willful misconduct, or gross negligence.

     4. Compensation of Escrow Agent. Lender shall pay to Escrow Agent for 
its services as Escrow Agent hereunder such compensation as may be agreed 
to from time to time, separately in writing, by Lender and Escrow Agent. 
Such compensation shall be fully earned when due and non-refundable when

counsel.

defend any litigation under this Agreement or otherwise or in relation to 
this Agreement, even if at the request, order or direction of the Lender,

indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and 
liabilities that may be incurred by the Escrow Agent therein or thereby.

(n) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in no event 
shall the Escrow Agent be liable for special, indirect or consequential 
loss or damage of any kind whatsoever (including but not limited to lost 
profits), even if the Escrow Agent has been advised of the likelihood of 
such loss or damage and regardless of the form of action.

(o) Escrow Agent shall not be required to take any action hereunder if the 
Escrow Agent shall have reasonably determined, or shall have been advised 
by counsel, that such action is likely to result in liability on the part 
of the Escrow Agent or is contrary to the terms hereof or is otherwise 
contrary to law.

(p) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Escrow Agent

or the Agent hereunder or under the Loan Agreement and, except as expressly 
set forth herein, shall have no duty to determine the compliance by either 
thereof with the terms hereof or thereof.

duties and obligations under this Agreement, Escrow Agent: (i) may act

selected in good faith and employed by it. Escrow Agent shall not be liable 
for anything done, suffered or omitted in good faith by it in accordance

shall be appropriate under the circumstances) to the Lender and Agent 
requesting instruction as to the course of action to be adopted, and, to 
the extent the Escrow Agent acts in good faith in accordance with any such 
instruction received, the Escrow Agent shall not be liable on account of 
such action to any person or party. In the event that the Escrow Agent

5

Agreement shall have first received the same and not otherwise paid out 
such funds in accordance with written instruction under this Agreement. In 
the event of any dispute or other circumstance sufficient in the sole 
discretion of Escrow Agent to justify its doing so, Escrow Agent shall be 
entitled to tender the Escrow Funds and any earnings thereon, into the 
registry of custody of any court of competent jurisdiction, together with 
such legal pleadings as it may deem appropriate, and thereupon be 
discharged from all further duties and liabilities under this Agreement.

against any loss, liability, expense (including but not limited to 
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses), claims or demands arising out of 
or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, except for the 
Indemnified Persons gross negligence or willful misconduct. IT IS THE 
EXPRESS INTENT OF THE PARTIES THAT, FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS PARAGRAPH, 
CLAIMS, AND THE OBLIGATIONS OF LENDER AND TRUST TO DEFEND, PROTECT, 
INDEMNIFY, AND HOLD HARMLESS, WILL INCLUDE, BUT NOT BE LIMITED TO, CLAIMS 
ARISING OUT OF OR RESULTING FROM ESCROW AGENTS SOLE OR CONCURRENT (1) 
NEGLIGENCE, (2) STRICT LIABILITY, OR (3) OTHER FAULT OF ANY NATURE, 
provided that there shall be no obligation to defend, indemnify or hold 
Escrow Agent harmless from any claims arising out of or resulting from 
Escrow Agents gross negligence or willful misconduct. The foregoing 
indemnity shall survive the resignation or removal of Escrow Agent pursuant 
hereto and the termination of this Agreement.

represents and warrants to Lender, Trust and Agent, as of the Agreement 
date, and as of each date it accepts funds to be held in escrow hereunder,

written notice of such resignation, and Agent shall provide to Escrow Agent

appointment of a successor Escrow Agent hereunder and the acceptance by 
such successor of the duties of Escrow Agent hereunder. Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, if no replacement Escrow Agent is appointed in accordance with 
this Section 11 within thirty (30) days after Escrow Agent gives written 
notice to Lender, Trust and Agent of its resignation or Escrow Agent has 
been notified of its removal, the Escrow Agent may, at the joint and 
several expense of the Lender and Trust, petition, any court of competent 
jurisdiction for the appointment of its successor.

HOLD HARMLESS AGREEMENT
[TRUST-NAME]

     The undersigned Grantor and each undersigned Beneficiary release and 
agree to hold harmless the Insurance Agent [AGENT], the Trustee of the 
[TRUST-NAME], (the Trust), for any and all actions, acts or inactions of 
the Insurance Agent and the Trustee in connection with the issuance and/or 
maintenance of any insurance policy(ies) acquired or held by the Trust, the 
administration of the Trust or any other matters related thereto, except 
for dishonesty or intentional fraud, and understand and agree that in the 
event the Trust assets are sold or liquidated on account of any default 
under any loan agreement or other indebtedness (Policy Loan) there are no 
guarantees as to the amount of the net proceeds therefrom except that the 
Trust shall pay to the Beneficiaries the amounts, if any, in excess of full 
satisfaction under any loan agreement or indebtedness in the event of (a) 
the Grantors death or (b) the termination of the Trust. NOTWITHSTANDING, 
THE GRANTOR AND EACH BENEFICIARY UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE NO 
REPRESENTATIONS OR GUARANTEES OF ANY KIND THAT THERE WILL BE ANY FUNDS TO 
DISTRIBUTE TO THE BENEFICIARIES AFTER THE PAYMENT OF ANY INDEBTEDNESS.

     The Grantor and each Beneficiary understand that neither the Trustee 
nor the Insurance Agent nor any other person is rendering legal or tax 
advice by virtue of the Trust or acquisition or financing of the life 
insurance policy, and that the Grantor and each Beneficiary are urged to 
consult their own advisors, AS THE TRUST IS NOT A COMPLETE ESTATE PLANNING 
DOCUMENT.

     The Grantor and each Beneficiary also represent that the only 
understanding, obligations and representations of any person in connection 
with the Trust and/or the acquisition and/or financing of the life 
insurance policy that are of any validity, force or effect are those in 
writing and that no oral statement or representation to the contrary is of 
any force or effect, and there are no other terms, conditions, or 
understandings whatsoever of any kind or nature concerning the purchase, 
financing, or acquisition of any life insurance policy, the subject matter 
of the Trust, and that any other such term, condition, or understanding is 
of no force or effect.

     The Grantor and each Beneficiary also represent that the insurance 
applied for and owned or to be owned by the Trust was applied for and/or 
obtained not for investment but rather for estate preservation purposes and 
the ability to leverage the money of Lender will allow the Trust to 
purchase the Policy that will have a high death benefit option. This will 
(a) allow Grantor and the representative of Grantors estate the ability to 
protect against significant estate tax consequences that Grantors estate 
may face given the current state of the law, (b) will provide Grantors 
estate with certain protection in the event estate tax liability should 
arise, and (c) permit Grantor to be able to protect the Beneficiaries from 
certain potential expenses that they would otherwise sustain without the 
liquidity that the Policy will offer.

GUARANTY

THIS GUARANTY is entered into as of [DATE] by the undersigned (the 
Guarantor), in favor of and for the benefit of [LENDER-NAME], a Florida 
limited liability company (which for all purposes of this Guaranty shall 
include any assignees, whether or not by operation of law, and successors 
thereto, the Lender).


RECITALS

Pursuant to a loan agreement between the Lender and [TRUST-NAME] (Trust 
or Borrower) dated [DATE] (the Loan Agreement), the Lender has made an 
initial loan in the amount of [FIRST-YEAR-PREMIUM] (the Loan) to the 
Trust as evidenced by the Promissory Note dated [DATE] (as amended, 
supplemented or modified from time to time, the Note). The proceeds of 
the Loan were used to pay or reimburse for the premiums due under life 
insurance policy number [POLICY-NUMBER] issued by [INSURER] (the Insurer) 
on the life of [INSURED] in the face amount of [NET-DEATH-BENEFIT] (the 
Policy).

The Guarantor, as grantor of the Borrower, acknowledges and agrees that the 
Guarantor has received and will receive direct and indirect benefits from 
the extension of the Loan made to the Borrower. Any capitalized terms used 
herein and not otherwise defined shall have the definitions accorded to 
such terms in the Loan Agreement.

     1. Conditions to Liability. Notwithstanding anything herein to the 
contrary, this Guaranty shall result in liability to the Guarantor only in 
the event that any of the following shall occur (each of which shall be 
identified as a Default):

          (a) Any act (or omission to act) of fraud or willful misconduct 
on the part of the Guarantor, or any other action or inaction by the 
Guarantor, that impairs the Lenders ability to be repaid under the Note or 
otherwise under the Loan;

          (b) Any act (or omission to act) of the Guarantor that directly 
or indirectly impairs the Lenders rights to the Policy as collateral under 
the terms of the Loan, the Note, any Financing Document and/or the 
Collateral Assignment;

          (c) Any failure of the Borrower to use the proceeds of the Loan 
exclusively as set forth in the Note, the Financing Documents or any other 
documents related to the Loan;

          (d) Any act by the Borrower or the Guarantor to transfer, amend, 
change ownership of, cancel, convey, sell or assign the Policy or any 
interest therein without the express written consent of the Lender;

          (e) Any failure to act by the Borrower or the Guarantor that 
results, directly or indirectly, in the transfer of the Policy or any 
interest therein or any amendment, change of ownership, cancellation, 
conveyance, sale or assignment thereof, except with the express written 
consent of the Lender;

          (f) [Any default in payment of, or failure to pay any, interest, 
principal or other amounts which become due under the Note or Loan;] 
[OPTIONAL]

 

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

          (g) The breach of any representation, warranty or covenant by the 
Guarantor contained in the Collateral Assignment or in any Financing 
Document;

          (h) Any act or action by any Beneficiary or any other person 
asserting to be a beneficiary under the Trust Agreement that impairs, 
delays or interferes with the Lenders rights to have ownership of the Life 
Insurance Policy transferred to it or its designee following an Event of 
Default and a foreclosure by the Lender on the beneficial ownership 
interests in the Borrower pursuant to the Pledge Agreement; and

          (i) Any failure of the Borrower, the Guarantor or any beneficiary 
of the Borrower who directly or indirectly receives any payment from the 
Insurer prior to the repayment of the Loan, to pay or cause to be paid to 
the Lender all or such portion of such payment necessary to repay the 
entire outstanding balance of the Loan and any other outstanding amounts 
under the Financing Documents, together with any accrued and unpaid 
interest thereon and any other charges and expenses payable to the Lender 
under the terms of the Note, the Financing Documents and any other 
documents related to the Loan.

          Upon the occurrence of a Default, the Guarantor hereby 
irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees to the Lender, the due and 
punctual payment when due of all liabilities and all other amounts 
outstanding or due to be paid to the Lender under, in connection with or 
related to, the Loan and any other agreements entered into with respect 
thereto (including the Financing Documents), including but not limited to 
outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest under the Note, any 
early termination fees, costs and expenses payable to the Lender 
(including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys fees) in the event of 
an uncured default under the Loan or any Financing Document, as well as any 
and all costs and expenses of the Lender to enforce this Guaranty 
(including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys fees), whether or not 
(i) due or owing to, or in favor or for the benefit of, the Lender, or (ii) 
ARISING OR ACCRUING BEFORE OR AFTER THE FILING BY OR AGAINST THE GUARANTOR 
OF A PETITION UNDER THE BANKRUPTCY CODE OR ANY SIMILAR FILING BY OR AGAINST 
THE GUARANTOR, AS THE CASE MAY BE, UNDER THE LAWS OF ANY JURISDICTION OR 
(c) ALLOWABLE UNDER SECTION 502(b)(2) OF THE BANKRUPTCY CODE (collectively, 
the Guaranteed Obligations).

          Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event liability under this 
Guaranty results solely as a result of a Default as described in Section 
1(g), the Guarantors liability shall be limited to 100% of the amount 
outstanding or due under the Guaranteed Obligations.

     2. Waiver.

          (a) The Guarantor unconditionally and irrevocably waives, to the 
fullest extent permitted by applicable law: (i) notice of any of the 
matters referred to in Section 1 hereof; (ii) all notices which may be 
required by statute, rule of law or otherwise to preserve any rights 
against the Guarantor hereunder, including, without limitation, notice of 
the acceptance of this Guaranty, or the creation, renewal, extension, 
modification or accrual of the Guaranteed Obligations or notice of any 
other matters relating thereto, any presentment, demand, notice of 
dishonor, protest, nonpayment of any damages or other amounts payable under 
any Financing Document; (iii) any requirement for the enforcement, 
assertion or exercise of any right, remedy,

 

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

power or privilege under or in respect of any Financing Document, 
including, without limitation, diligence in collection or protection of or 
realization upon the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof or any 
collateral therefor; (iv) any requirement of diligence; (v) any requirement 
to mitigate the damages resulting from a default by the Borrower under the 
Note or any Financing Document; (vi) the occurrence of every other 
condition precedent to which the Guarantor or the Borrower may otherwise be 
entitled; (vii) the right to require the Lender to proceed against the 
Borrower or any other person liable on the Guaranteed Obligations, to 
proceed against or exhaust any security held by the Borrower or any other 
person, or to pursue any other remedy in the Lenders power whatsoever; 
(viii) the right to have the property of the Borrower first applied to the 
discharge of the Guaranteed Obligations; (ix) any lack of validity or 
enforceability in the Note or any other Financing Document, (x) any 
exchange or release of, or non-perfection of any collateral securing, all 
or any of the Guaranteed Obligations; (xi) any release, amendment or waiver 
of or consent to departure from any other guaranty or any document relating 
to any security for or in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations; (xii) any 
other circumstances which might otherwise constitute a defense available 
to, or discharge of, the Guarantor; or (xiii) any and all rights it may now 
or hereafter have under any agreement or at law or in equity (including, 
without limitation, any law subrogating the Guarantor to the rights of the 
Lender) to assert any claim against or seek contribution, indemnification 
or any other form of reimbursement from the Borrower or any other party 
liable for payment of any or all of the Guaranteed Obligations for any 
payment made by the Guarantor under or in connection with this Guaranty or 
otherwise.

          (b) The Lender may, at its election, exercise any right or remedy 
it may have against the Borrower without affecting or impairing in any way 
the liability of the Guarantor hereunder and the Guarantor waives, to the 
fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any defense arising out of the 
absence, impairment or loss of any right of reimbursement, contribution or 
subrogation or any other right or remedy of the Guarantor against the 
Borrower, whether resulting from such election by the Lender or otherwise. 
The Guarantor waives any defense arising by reason of any disability or 
other defense of the Borrower or by reason of the cessation for any cause 
whatsoever of the liability, either in whole or in part, of the Borrower to 
the Lender for the Guaranteed Obligations.

          (c) The Guarantor assumes the responsibility for being and 
keeping informed of the financial condition of the Borrower and of all 
other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Guaranteed 
Obligations and agrees that the Lender shall not have any duty to advise 
the Guarantor of information regarding any condition or circumstance or any 
change in such condition or circumstance. The Guarantor acknowledges that 
the Lender has not made any representations to the Guarantor concerning the 
financial condition of the Borrower. The value of the consideration 
received and to be received by the Guarantor is reasonably worth at least 
as much as the liability and obligation of Guarantor incurred or arising 
under this Guaranty and all related papers and arrangements.

     3. Parties. This Guaranty shall inure to the benefit of the Lender and 
its successors, assigns or transferees, and shall be binding upon the 
Guarantor and his or her respective heirs, successors and assigns; 
provided, that the Guarantor may not delegate or assign any of the 
Guarantors duties or obligations under this Guaranty without the prior 
written consent of the Lender.

 

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

     4. Notices. All notices and other communications provided for herein 
shall be in writing and shall be delivered by hand or overnight courier 
service, mailed by U.S. mail, certified with return receipt requested, or 
sent by telecopy (with confirmed receipt or followed by overnight delivery) 
to the addresses (or telecopy numbers) set forth on the signature pages 
hereto. The Guarantor or the Lender may change its address or telecopy 
number for notices and other communications hereunder by notice to the 
other parties hereto. All notices and other communications given in 
accordance with the provisions of this Guaranty shall be deemed to have 
been given on the date of receipt or, if mailed, the fifth (5th) business 
day following the date so mailed, if earlier, or the next business day if 
sent by overnight courier.

     5. Right to Deal with the Borrower. At any time and from time to time, 
without terminating, affecting or impairing the validity of this Guaranty 
or the obligations of the Guarantor hereunder, the Lender may deal with the 
Borrower in the same manner and as fully as if this Guaranty did not exist 
and shall be entitled, among other things, to grant the Borrower, without 
notice or demand and without affecting the Guarantors liability hereunder, 
such extension or extensions of time to perform, renew, compromise, 
accelerate or otherwise change the time for payment of or otherwise change 
the terms of indebtedness or any part thereof contained in or arising under 
any Financing Document or any other document evidencing Obligations of the 
Borrower to the Lender, or to waive any obligation of the Borrower to 
perform, any act or acts as the Lender may deem advisable.

     6. Subrogation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained 
herein, any and all rights and claims of the Guarantor against the Borrower 
or any of its property or against any other person, arising by reason of 
any payment by the Guarantor to the Lender pursuant to the provisions, or 
in respect, of this Guaranty shall be subordinate, junior and subject in 
right of payment to the prior and indefeasible payment in full of the 
Guaranteed Obligations to the Lender, and until such time, the Guarantor 
shall have no right of subrogation, contribution or any similar right and 
hereby waive any right to enforce any remedy the Lender may now or 
hereafter have against the Borrower, any endorser or any other guarantor of 
all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations and any right to participate 
in, or benefit from, any security given to the Lender to secure the 
Guaranteed Obligations. Any promissory note evidencing such liability of 
the Borrower to the Guarantor shall be non-negotiable, shall expressly 
state that it is subordinated pursuant to this Guaranty and shall be 
immediately assigned (with recourse) and delivered to the Lender. All liens 
and security interests of the Guarantor, whether now or hereafter arising 
and howsoever existing, in assets of the Borrower or any assets securing 
the Guaranteed Obligations shall be and hereby are subordinated to the 
rights and interests of the Lender in those assets until the prior and 
indefeasible final payment in full of all of the Guaranteed Obligations to 
the Lender and termination of all financing arrangements between the 
Borrower and the Lender. If any amount shall be paid to the Guarantor 
contrary to the provisions of this Section 6 at any time when all the 
Guaranteed Obligations shall not have been indefeasibly paid in full, such 
amount shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Lender and shall 
forthwith be turned over in kind in the form received to the Lender (duly 
endorsed if necessary) to be credited and applied against the Guaranteed 
Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of 
the Financing Documents and this Guaranty.

     7. Survival of Representations, Warranties, and Agreements. All 
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements made herein, 
including representations

 

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

and warranties deemed made herein, shall survive any investigation or 
inspection made by or on behalf of the Lender and shall continue in full 
force and effect until all of the obligations of the Guarantor under this 
Guaranty shall be fully performed in accordance with the terms hereof, and 
until the payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations.

     8. GOVERNING LAW; CONSENT TO JURISDICTION; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. THIS 
GUARANTY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF 
THE STATE OF [JURISDICTION-UC]. THE GUARANTOR HEREBY IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO 
THE JURISDICTION OF THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR ANY DISTRICT OF 
[JURISDICTION-UC] AND ANY COURT IN THE STATE OF [JURISDICTION-UC] IN ANY 
ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT AGAINST THE GUARANTOR AND RELATED TO OR 
IN CONNECTION WITH THIS GUARANTY OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, 
AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE GUARANTOR HEREBY WAIVES 
AND AGREES NOT TO ASSERT BY WAY OF MOTION, AS A DEFENSE OR OTHERWISE IN ANY 
SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING, ANY CLAIM THAT THE GUARANTOR IS NOT 
PERSONALLY SUBJECT TO THE JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURTS, THAT THE SUIT, 
ACTION OR PROCEEDING IS BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM, THAT THE VENUE OF 
THE SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING IS IMPROPER, OR THAT THIS GUARANTY OR ANY 
DOCUMENT OR ANY INSTRUMENT REFERRED TO HEREIN OR THE SUBJECT MATTER THEREOF 
MAY NOT BE LITIGATED IN OR BY SUCH COURTS. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY 
APPLICABLE LAW, THE GUARANTOR AGREES (I) NOT TO SEEK AND HEREBY WAIVES THE 
RIGHT TO ANY REVIEW OF THE JUDGMENT OF ANY SUCH COURT BY ANY COURT OF ANY 
OTHER NATION OR JURISDICTION WHICH MAY BE CALLED UPON TO GRANT AN 
ENFORCEMENT OF SUCH JUDGMENT AND (II) NOT TO ASSERT ANY COUNTERCLAIM, IN 
ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING UNLESS SUCH COUNTERCLAIM COULD NOT, BY 
REASON OF ANY APPLICABLE FEDERAL OR STATE PROCEDURAL LAWS, BE INTERPOSED, 
PLEADED OR ALLEGED IN ANY OTHER ACTION. THE GUARANTOR AGREES THAT SERVICE 
OF PROCESS MAY BE MADE UPON THE GUARANTOR BY CERTIFIED OR REGISTERED MAIL 
TO THE ADDRESS FOR NOTICES SET FORTH IN THIS GUARANTY OR ANY METHOD 
AUTHORIZED BY THE LAWS OF [JURISDICTION-UC]. THE GUARANTOR IRREVOCABLY 
WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM 
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS GUARANTY, THE FINANCING DOCUMENTS OR THE 
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY.

     9. Expenses. The Guarantor hereby agrees to pay on demand, and to hold 
the Lender harmless against liability for, any and all costs and expenses 
(including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees, costs and expenses 
of counsel and fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with any 
bankruptcy proceeding) incurred or expended by the Lender in connection 
with the enforcement, amendment, modification or waiver of or preservation 
of any rights under this Guaranty, and the collection of amounts payable 
hereunder, and until so paid, such fees, costs, disbursements and expenses 
shall be added to, and constitute, Guaranteed Obligations.

 

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

     10. Further Assurances. The Guarantor hereby covenants and agrees to 
execute and deliver to the Lender such additional agreements, instruments 
and documents as the Lender may reasonably request to give effect to the 
obligations of the Guarantor under this Guaranty.

     11. Miscellaneous.

          If any term of this Guaranty or any application hereof shall be 
invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this Guaranty and any other 
application of such term shall not be affected thereby.

          Any term of this Guaranty may be amended, waived, discharged or 
terminated only by an instrument in writing signed by the Guarantor and the 
Lender. No notice to or demand on the Guarantor shall be deemed to be a 
waiver of the obligations of the Guarantor or of the right of the Lender to 
take further action without notice or demand as provided in this Guaranty. 
No course of dealing between the Guarantor and the Lender shall change, 
modify or discharge, in whole or in part, this Guaranty or any obligations 
of the Guarantor hereunder. No waiver of any term, covenant or provision of 
this Guaranty shall be effective unless given in writing by the Lender and 
if so given shall only be effective in the specific instance in which 
given.

          The headings in this Guaranty are for purposes of reference only 
and shall not limit or define the meaning hereof.

          No delay or failure of the Lender in exercising any right, power 
or privilege hereunder or under the Financing Documents, shall affect such 
right, power or privilege nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof 
or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right, 
power or privilege preclude any further exercise thereof or of any other 
right, power or privilege. The Lenders rights and remedies hereunder are 
cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies which it would 
otherwise have. Any waiver, permit, consent or approval of any kind or 
character of the Lender concerning any breach or default by the Guarantor 
under this Guaranty must be in writing and specifically described.

          All payments made by the Guarantor hereunder to the Lender in 
respect of the Guaranteed Obligations shall be made to the Lender in U.S. 
dollars and immediately available funds at an account designated by the 
Lender, or to such other place as the Lender may hereafter specify in 
writing.

          The execution and delivery of this Guaranty shall not supersede, 
terminate, modify or supplement in any manner any other guaranty previously 
executed and delivered to the Lender by the Guarantor and no release or 
termination of this Guaranty shall be construed to terminate or release any 
other guaranty unless such other guaranty is specifically referred to in 
any such termination.

          The Guarantors obligations hereunder shall be the personal 
obligations of such Guarantor.

 

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

          This Guaranty is a continuing guaranty and shall remain in full 
force and effect without regard to any defenses or counterclaims that the 
Guarantor or the Borrower may assert on the debt underlying this Guaranty, 
including, but not limited to, failure of consideration, breach of 
warranty, fraud, statute of frauds, bankruptcy, statute of limitations, 
lender liability, accord and satisfaction and usury until (A) all of the 
Guaranteed Obligations shall have been indefeasibly paid in full and (B) 
Borrower shall have indefeasibly satisfied all of its Obligations under the 
Note and the other Financing Documents and notice thereof has been provided 
by Lender to the Guarantor.

[LENDER-NAME] (the Lender) is offering a life insurance premium financing 
arrangement (the Financing Arrangement) which provides trusts settled by 
individuals, such as the Grantor, with financing to purchase and maintain a 
life insurance policy (the Policy) on the life of certain qualifying 
individuals, such as the Insured. To obtain financing under the Financing 
Arrangement, the Insured or Grantor must settle (or have settled) a life 
insurance trust (the Life Insurance Trust or Trust) under 
[JURISDICTION] law and the Insured must consent (or have consented) to the 
Life Insurance Trusts purchase of the Policy. The Grantor must have an 
insurable interest in the life of the Insured and all beneficiaries of the 
Life Insurance Trust must be individuals or tax-exempt charities with an 
insurable interest in the life of the Insured or an estate planning 
vehicle, all of the owners or beneficiaries of which have an insurable 
interest in the life of the Insured.

In order to participate in the Financing Arrangement, the Trust will be 
required to execute a Loan Application and Agreement (the Loan Agreement
) and a Promissory Note in favor of the Lender. Pursuant to the Loan 
Agreement, the Lender will, subject to the terms, provisions and conditions 
of the Loan Agreement, make an advance of funds to, or for the benefit of, 
the Trust for the purpose of funding premiums under the Policy. The 
obligations of the Trust under the Loan Agreement may be secured by a 
collateral assignment of the Life Insurance Trusts interest in the Policy 
under a collateral assignment agreement between the Trust and the 
Collateral Agent (the Collateral Assignment Agreement). The obligations 
under the Loan Agreement will bear periodic interest at a [FIXED-FLOATING] 
subject to a minimum interest rate of nine percent

 

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

(9%) (in the case of a floating rate) and will be due and payable (i) one 
(1) Business Day after payment of any proceeds of the Policy, and (ii) any 
other date that the principal and interest shall become due and payable in 
full under the Loan Agreement, whether at the scheduled maturity under the 
Promissory Note, by acceleration, notice of prepayment, or otherwise. The 
Trust may pre-pay the Loan (including any accrued interest), in full but 
not in part, without penalty other than the payment of the Yield 
Maintenance Premium in some circumstances, as provided under the Loan 
Agreement.

Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings 
assigned thereto in the Loan Agreement.

Each of the following are events of default under the Loan Agreement and 
Financing Documents:

Payment Default. Trust fails to make any payment within three (3) Business 
Days after the same becomes due and payable under the Loan Agreement, the 
Promissory Note or any other Financing Document.

Other Defaults. Trust fails to comply with or to perform any other term, 
obligation, covenant or condition contained in the Promissory Note, the 
Loan Agreement or in any of the other Financing Documents or to comply with 
or to perform any term, obligation, covenant or condition contained in any 
other agreement between Lender and Trust or a default occurs under the 
Promissory Note, Loan Agreement, Security Agreement or any other Financing 
Document.

False Statements. Any warranty, representation or statement made or 
furnished to Lender by the Trust, the Insured or on Trusts behalf under 
the Promissory Note, the Loan Agreement or any other Financing Document is 
false or misleading in any material respect, either now or at the time made 
or furnished or becomes false or misleading at any time thereafter.

Related Agreements. The Policy, Promissory Note, Loan Agreement, Security 
Agreement or any other Financing Document ceases to be in full force and 
effect (including failure of any collateral document to create a valid and 
perfected security interest or lien) at any time and for any reason; the 
Trust becomes a revocable trust, contests the validity or enforceability of 
any Financing Document or denies that it has any further liability under 
any Financing Document to which it is a party, or cancels or terminates, or 
attempts to cancel or terminate, the Policy; or the Insurer contests the 
Policy based on the Trust lacking an insurable interest in the life of the 
Insured.

Indebtedness, Creditor or Forfeiture Proceedings. Any garnishment of any of 
Trusts accounts, attachment, lien, levy, additional encumbrance or 
additional security interest being placed upon any of the Collateral, or 
any commencement of foreclosure or forfeiture proceedings, whether by 
judicial proceeding, self-help, repossession or any other method, by any 
creditor of Trust or by any

2

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

governmental agency against any Collateral, and which is not discharged in 
full within one (1) day of the placement thereof. However, this Event of 
Default shall not apply if there is a good faith dispute by the Trust as to 
the validity or reasonableness of the claim which is the basis of the 
creditor or forfeiture proceeding and if the Trust gives Lender written 
notice of the creditor or forfeiture proceeding and deposits with Lender 
monies or a surety bond for the creditor or forfeiture proceeding, in an 
amount determined by Lender, in its sole discretion, as being an adequate 
reserve or bond for the dispute.

Insolvency or Default of Trust. The Trust is: (i) dissolved, liquidated or 
terminated; (ii) is unable to pay its debts as they mature; (iii) makes an 
assignment for the benefit of creditors; (iv) is bankrupt or insolvent; (v) 
seeks appointment of, or becomes the subject of an order appointing, a 
trustee, conservator, liquidator or receiver as to all or part of its 
assets; (vi) commences, approves or consents to, or is the debtor in, any 
case or proceeding under any bankruptcy, reorganization or similar law, and 
in the case of an involuntary case or proceeding, such case or proceeding 
is not dismissed thirty (30) days following its commencement; (vii) is the 
subject of an order for relief in an involuntary case under federal 
bankruptcy law; (viii) the Trust defaults under any loan, extension of 
credit, security agreement, purchase or sales agreement, or any other 
agreement, in favor of any other creditor or person that may materially 
affect any of Trusts property or Trusts ability to repay the Promissory 
Note or perform Trusts Obligations under the Promissory Note, the Loan 
Agreement or any of other Financing Documents; or (ix) Trust violates any 
Law.

Insolvency or Default of Insured or Guarantor. (i) The Insured or any 
Guarantor makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors; (ii) The 
Insured or any Guarantor is adjudicated a bankrupt or insolvent; (iii) The 
Insured or any Guarantor seeks appointment of, or becomes the subject of an 
order appointing, a trustee, conservator, or receiver as to all or part of 
his assets; (iv) The Insured or any Guarantor commences, approves or 
consents to, or is the debtor in, any case or proceeding under any 
bankruptcy or similar law and, in the case of an involuntary case or 
proceeding, such case or proceeding is not dismissed thirty (30) days 
following its commencement; (v) The Insured or any Guarantor is the subject 
of an order for relief in an involuntary case under federal bankruptcy law; 
(vi) Trust defaults under any loan, extension of credit, security 
agreement, purchase or sales agreement, or any other agreement, in favor of 
any other creditor or person that may materially affect any of Trusts 
property or Trusts ability to repay the Obligations; or (vii) any 
Guarantor defaults under the terms of the Personal Guaranty.

Events Affecting Guarantor. Any of the preceding events occurs with respect 
to any Guarantor of any of the indebtedness under the Promissory Note or 
any Guarantor dies or becomes incompetent, or revokes or disputes the 
validity of, or liability under, any guaranty of the indebtedness evidenced 
by the Promissory Note; in the event of a death, Lender, at its option, 
may, but shall not be required

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

to, permit the Guarantors estate to assume unconditionally the obligations 
arising under the guaranty in a manner satisfactory to Lender, and, in 
doing so, cure any Event of Default.

Adverse Change. A material adverse change occurs in Trusts financial 
condition, or Lender believes the prospect of payment or performance of the 
Obligations is materially impaired.

Cure Provisions. Other than as set forth in the preceding clauses of this 
Section, failure by the Trust or Beneficiary, as applicable, to perform in 
any material respect any of its obligations under the Promissory Note, Loan 
Agreement, Security Agreement or any other Financing Document to which 
either is a party if such failure is not remedied on or prior to the 
fifteenth (15th) day after written notice of such failure is given to the 
Trust or the Beneficiary, respectively, by the Lender.

In connection with, and as a condition precedent to the Trust obtaining a 
loan from the Lender in connection with the Financing Arrangement, 
settlement of the Trust and the undersigned Grantor, Insured and, if as of 
the date hereof the Insured is lawfully married, the Insureds Spouse1, do 
each hereby acknowledge, represent, warrant, covenant and agree, jointly 
and severally, to the following:

1. 	  	The Grantor, the Insured and the Insureds Spouse with their 
advisors which they deem appropriate (including, for example, attorneys, 
tax advisors and accountants), have read and understand the terms of each 
Financing Arrangement Document, including, without limitation, this Insured 
Disclosure Statement, Representations and Warranties, and Consent 
(Disclosure Statement), any credit application, the Trust Agreement for 
the Life Insurance Trust, the Loan Agreement, the Promissory Note, the 
Collateral Assignment, the Authorization for Disclosure of Protected Health 
Information and the Authorization and Direction to Provide Death 
Certificate (collectively, the Financing Arrangement Documents). The 
Insured has specifically received appropriate legal and tax advice 
regarding the form, substance and drafting of the Trust Agreement for the 
Life Insurance Trust.

2. 	  	The terms of the Financing Arrangement Documents are fair and 
reasonable to the Life Insurance Trust, the Insured and the Insureds 
Spouse.

3. 	  	The initial contribution of the Insured, if any, to the Life 
Insurance Trust constitutes the Insureds separate property and does not 
constitute the community property or quasi-community property of the 
Insured and the Insureds Spouse. The Insured and the Insureds Spouse 
hereby agree to execute any additional


 
1 	  	If the Insured is not married as of the date hereof, all references 
to Spouse in this Disclosure Statement and Consent are hereby rendered 
null and void.

4

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

  	  	documentation legally required to commute such property to the 
separate property of the Insured.

4. 	  	The Insured is financially sophisticated and, individually or 
together with the Insureds Spouse, has a net worth of at least 
[NET-WORTH]. The Insured formed and is the sole grantor of the Life 
Insurance Trust.

5. 	  	There may be federal, state or local income, gift or estate tax 
effects of participation in the Financing Arrangement to the Grantor, the 
Insured, the Insureds Spouse, the beneficiary(ies) of the Life Insurance 
Trust (Beneficiary) and the Life Insurance Trust. Participation in the 
Financing Arrangement, and termination of participation, could increase the 
taxable income, taxable gifts or taxable estate of a participant including 
the Grantor and Beneficiary. The Grantor, the Insured and the Insureds 
Spouse recognize that if the Policy is not held to maturity and is instead 
surrendered to the issuer or sold on the secondary market, any amounts 
received in excess of the tax basis or possibly the fair market value, if 
lower, of the Policy will be taxable income to one or more of the 
participants. It is unclear under existing tax law whether this income will 
be treated as ordinary income or capital gain income. Some tax 
practitioners have suggested that if the surrender or sale proceeds exceed 
a policys cash surrender value, the excess should be taxed as capital 
gains; and if the cash surrender value exceeds the basis of the policy, a 
conservative approach is to treat that excess as ordinary income. In 
addition, it is unclear under federal income tax law how to compute the tax 
basis in the Policy. Specifically, the Internal Revenue Service has taken 
the position that an owners basis in a policy equals premiums paid minus 
any nontaxable dividends and minus the value of the life insurance 
protection the owner has enjoyed. While existing case law does not appear 
to support this position, there can be no assurances on the outcome of this 
issue if disputed. The Grantor, the Insured and the Insureds Spouse 
recognize that interest incurred on indebtedness the proceeds of which are 
used to pay premiums on the Policy cannot be deducted for tax purposes and 
it is unclear whether any non-deductible interest can be added to the tax 
basis in the Policy. In the event that the Lender forecloses upon the 
Policy following a default under the Financing Arrangement, the excess of 
the amount owed over the tax basis in, or possibly the fair market value, 
if lower, of, the Policy may be ordinary taxable income, unless an 
exception to recognition applies. In all cases, any income realized upon a 
sale, surrender, foreclosure upon or other transfer of the Policy may be 
taxable to the Grantor even through any proceeds may be receivable by the 
Trustee and be required to be used to satisfy any outstanding indebtedness 
and then be distributed to the Beneficiary. This will result in the Grantor 
recognizing income without any cash proceeds (so-called phantom income) 
from which to pay any related tax. The Grantor may also recognize phantom 
income annually based on the value of any insurance provided. The Grantor, 
the Insured, the Beneficiary and the Insureds Spouse have not relied upon 
any advice from the Lender, any life agent or other producer, any insurance 
company that has issued the Policy or any other person associated with the 
Financing Arrangement regarding any such tax effects.

5

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

  	  	The Grantor, the Insured, the Beneficiary and the Insureds Spouse 
have consulted with their own legal, tax and accounting advisors to 
determine the tax effects of the Financing Arrangement on such party.

6. 	  	Insurance companies may only allow any person to purchase, in the 
aggregate, a limited amount of life insurance on the life of the Insured, 
and the Trusts purchase, and the maintenance in force, of the Policy may 
use all or a part of this limited insurance capacity. Therefore, in the 
future, the Insured, the Insureds Spouse, the Trust or any other family 
members of the Insured may be unable to purchase life insurance on the life 
of the Insured in the amounts desired as a consequence of the purchase, and 
the maintenance in force, of the Policy. In the event that the Lender 
forecloses upon the Policy following an Event of Default under the Loan 
Agreement and Financing Documents and resells or further assigns the Policy 
in order to recover on its loan, the Policy may be maintained in force and 
this could in the future limit or eliminate the ability of the Insured, the 
Insureds Spouse, the Trust or any other family members of the Insured to 
purchase future insurance on the Insureds life because there is a limit to 
how much coverage insurers will issue on one life.

7. 	  	Unless otherwise set forth in Schedule A hereto, the only 
beneficiaries of the Insurance Trust are the Insured, the Insureds Spouse 
and/or children or other issue of the Insured or an entity or trust [(a)] 
the beneficiaries of which are either the Insureds Spouse or a child or 
other issue of the Insured [and/or (b) an entity which is qualified as 
tax-exempt under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as 
amended,] and the Grantor is either the Insured, the Insureds Spouse or a 
child of the Insured.

8. 	  	Neither the Insured nor the Insureds Spouse have been paid, 
directly or indirectly, any inducement (money, property or otherwise) in 
connection with the Financing Arrangement or to obtain the Policy.

9. 	  	None of the Grantor, the Insured, the Insureds Spouse or, to the 
knowledge of the foregoing persons, any beneficiary of the Trust has any 
present intention to surrender, sell or settle, directly or indirectly, the 
Policy or any interest therein.

10. 	  	Unless otherwise set forth in Schedule A hereto, no person or 
entity other than the Life Insurance Trust, the Life Insurance Trustee, the 
beneficiaries of the Life Insurance Trust, and the Lender has any direct or 
indirect interest in the Policy.

11. 	  	The Policy application has been completed accurately and there are 
no material omissions or misstatements in the application.

12. 	  	The Lender, or any subsequent owner of the Loan Agreement, may 
sell, or sell participations in, the Loan Agreement without the consent of, 
or prior notice to, the Grantor, the Insured, the Insureds Spouse or the 
Life Insurance Trust and the Insured and the Insureds Spouse agree to take 
all actions (but at no cost or

6

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

  	  	expense to the Insured or the Insureds Spouse) requested by the 
Lender in connection with any such sale or participation.

13. 	  	The Insured agrees to provide certain medical and health 
information (collectively, Private Health Information) as may be 
reasonably requested, from time to time, by the Life Insurance Trust, the 
Lender, life expectancy underwriters and any of their respective 
representatives, agents, designees, third party servicers and purchasers of 
the Policy following the occurrence of an event of default under the Loan 
Agreement, successors or assignees (collectively, the Authorized 
Recipients). To facilitate this provision of Private Health Information, 
the Insured agrees to execute such documents as are necessary to release 
such information to the relevant parties needing to review such information 
so as to allow the Life Insurance Trust to obtain a loan from the Lender in 
connection with the Financing Arrangement or to sell the Policy in 
connection with a foreclosure or otherwise. The Private Health Information 
may be used by the Authorized Recipients for the purposes of (i) valuing 
the Policy as collateral for the loan and (ii) assisting in any disposition 
of the Policy. The Private Health Information may be maintained and/or 
processed in any jurisdiction or country. The disclosure of Private Health 
Information to any of the Authorized Recipients may involve transfers to 
countries outside the United States which may not have laws comparable to 
those in the United States to protect personal data.

14. 	  	The Insured understands that the Trusts obligations under the Loan 
Agreement are secured or supported by, among other things, the Policy, and 
that the Lender can properly evaluate the value of the Policy as collateral 
for the Loan Agreement only by considering the Private Health Information. 
Absent such information, the Lender would likely deny the Insureds 
application because the cash surrender value of the Policy would be 
inadequate to support the loan requested. Therefore, in order for the 
Lender to evaluate the collateral value of the Policy, the Insured directs 
and authorizes the Lender to obtain and consider the Private Health 
Information.

15. 	  	The Insured represents that all Private Health Information that has 
been provided by or on behalf of the Insured to the Lender and its 
designees or third party servicers, the issuer of the Policy and any life 
expectancy underwriters, at the time so provided, was true and complete in 
all material respects to the best of the Insureds knowledge.

16. 	  	The Insured agrees to inform the Trustee, or any designees or 
agents thereof, within thirty (30) days of any and all changes in contact 
information of the Insured and the Insureds Spouse, including home address 
or telephone number. The Insured and the Insureds Spouse acknowledge that 
the Trustee, on behalf of the Trust, the Lender and its designees or third 
party servicers and any subsequent owner of the Policy, or any of their 
respective representatives, servicers, agents or designees may, from time 
to time and at their own discretion, contact the Insured and the Insureds 
Spouse for confirmation and update of such information.

7

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

17. 	  	The Policy is being purchased as part of the Insureds estate 
planning and for retirement purposes.

18. 	  	To the knowledge of the Insured, the Life Insurance Trust has not 
entered into any contracts or agreements, other than the Policy and the 
relevant Financing Arrangement Documents.

19. 	  	If the Insurer of the Policy cancels the Policy prior to the 
repayment of the obligations of the Trust to Lender under the Financing 
Arrangement Documents, the obligations of the Insured and the Life 
Insurance Trust and the rights of Lender with respect to the Financing 
Arrangement Documents and with respect to the Policy shall continue in full 
force, unaffected by such cancellation.

20. 	  	Each of the Insured and the Insureds Spouse is required to take 
all actions relating to the Financing Arrangement that may be necessary or 
desirable from time to time in the Life Insurance Trust or Lenders 
discretion (but at no cost or expense to the Insured or the Insureds 
Spouse), including, but not limited to, executing all such documents as may 
be required by the Life Insurance Trust, any life agent or other producer 
or any insurance company that has issued the Policy and/or beneficiary 
designation if the Lender enforces its security interest, if any, in the 
Policy, the Life Insurance Trust accounts and all other assets of the Life 
Insurance Trust following the occurrence of any event of default under the 
Loan Agreement or the Financing Arrangement Documents.

21. 	  	Any claims, questions or controversies arising under or related to 
in any manner whatsoever this Disclosure Statement or the transactions 
contemplated under the Financing Arrangement including, but not limited to, 
any challenge by the Grantor, the Insured, the Insureds Spouse or the 
Insureds estate, beneficiaries or subrogees (each, a Insured Party) 
against the Lender, its designees and/or third party servicers, the Life 
Insurance Trust, any broker, any insurance company or any other party 
interested in or related in any way to the Financing Arrangement (each, an 
Interested Third Party, notwithstanding the fact such parties are not 
signatories hereto) (a Dispute) shall be submitted to arbitration 
conducted before the American Arbitration Association (the AAA). Any 
Insured Party or any interested third party is hereby authorized to invoke 
this arbitration provision, and any judgment with respect to any award 
rendered pursuant to this arbitration provision may be entered in any court 
of competent jurisdiction. Such arbitration will be conducted under the 
rules of the AAA and the laws of the State of [JURISDICTION] and will be 
conducted in [TRUST-CITY-STATE]. Each Insured Party understands that claims 
submitted to arbitration are not heard by a jury and are not subject to the 
rules governing the courts. Each Insured Party further agrees that no claim 
may be brought as a class action, and that no Insured Party has the right 
to act, nor shall they attempt to act, as a class representative or 
participate as a member of a class of claimants with respect to any claim 
related to or arising out of the Financing Arrangement. To the extent that 
this arbitration

8

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

  	  	provision is held unenforceable, the Insured Parties: (i) irrevocably 
submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of any federal or state court sitting 
in [TRUST-CITY-STATE] in respect of any action or proceeding arising under 
or related to in any manner whatsoever this Disclosure Statement or the 
transactions contemplated under the Financing Arrangement, (ii) agree that 
this Disclosure Statement and the transactions contemplated by the 
Financing Arrangement shall in all respects be governed by and construed in 
accordance with the laws of the State of [JURISDICTION] (without reference 
to conflicts of laws provisions) and (iii) HEREBY WAIVE THE RIGHT SUCH 
PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY ON ANY CLAIM, COUNTERCLAIM, SETOFF, 
DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION (I) ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATED 
TO THIS DISCLOSURE STATEMENT OR (II) IN ANY WAY IN CONNECTION WITH OR 
PERTAINING OR RELATED TO OR INCIDENTAL TO ANY DEALINGS OF THE PARTIES TO 
THIS DISCLOSURE STATEMENT IN CONNECTION WITH THIS DISCLOSURE STATEMENT OR 
THE EXERCISE OF ANY PARTYS RIGHTS AND REMEDIES UNDER THIS DISCLOSURE 
STATEMENT OR OTHERWISE, OR THE CONDUCT OR THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE PARTIES 
HERETO, IN ALL OF THE FOREGOING CASES WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER 
ARISING AND WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE. The sole 
exception to this requirement for arbitration involves suits brought on 
behalf of the Lender seeking a temporary restraining order, preliminary 
injunction, and/or permanent injunction (injunctive relief) based upon 
(i) any failure of the Trust to use the proceeds of advanced exclusively as 
set forth in the Loan Agreement, the Promissory Note, the Financing 
Documents or any other documents related to the Loan Agreement; (ii) any 
act by the Trust or any Guarantor to transfer, amend, change ownership, 
cancel, convey, sell or assign the Policy without the express written 
consent of the Lender; or (iii) any failure to act by the Trust or any 
Guarantor that results, directly or indirectly, in the transfer of the 
Policy or any amendment, change of ownership, cancellation, conveyance, 
sale or assignment thereof, in the event there is immediate and irreparable 
injury, loss, or damage (which immediate and irreparable injury, loss, or 
damage may be presumed by law and/or by agreement of the parties). The 
parties hereby expressly agree, and each Interested Third Party in receipt 
of this Disclosure Statement acknowledges, that the arbitrartion provisions 
in this section shall not apply to the Trustee in respect of its rights, 
duties, protections and immunities.

22. 	  	The Grantor, the Insured and the Insureds Spouse acknowledge and 
understand that various charities, educational institutions and federal, 
state or local governmental entities or agencies may take into account the 
Life Insurance Trusts purchase, and the maintenance in force, of the 
Policy in determining the eligibility of the Insured, the Insureds Spouse 
or any other family members of the Insured to receive aid under one or more 
charitable, educational and federal, state or local governmental programs, 
including without limitation, Medicaid.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

23. 	  	The Grantor, the Insured and the Insureds Spouse acknowledge and 
understand that, due to cost of insurance increases or other factors 
relating to the Policy, it is possible that the amount of funds advanced 
under the Loan Agreement may not be sufficient to keep the Policy in force 
during the term of the Loan Agreement.

24. 	  	The Grantor, the Insured and the Insureds Spouse are each signing 
this Disclosure Statement freely and voluntarily and are each of sound mind 
and not subject to any constraint or undue influence, and neither has ever 
been the subject of any mental health or mental competency proceeding or 
any other proceeding or hearing with respect to which such partys 
competency or capacity to contract is or was an issue.

25. 	  	Each of the Grantor, the Insured and the Insureds Spouse has a 
complete understanding of this Disclosure Statement and has been given the 
opportunity to ask questions regarding the nature and operation of the 
Financing Arrangement.

26. 	  	As of the Execution Date and the Initial Premium Funding Date, the 
Insured is an individual residing in the state designated in the Financing 
Documents.

27. 	  	This document and the other Financing Documents to which the 
Insured is a party have been duly executed and delivered by the Insured, 
and (assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the other 
parties thereto) the Financing Documents constitute legal, valid and 
binding obligations of the Insured, enforceable against the Insured in 
accordance with their terms (subject to applicable bankruptcy, 
reorganization, insolvency, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors 
rights generally and to equitable principles of general application, 
regardless of whether such principles are considered in a proceeding in 
equity or at law).

28. 	  	The execution, delivery and performance by the Insured of the 
Financing Documents to which it is a party do not and will not (i) to the 
knowledge of the Insured, conflict with or cause a violation by the Insured 
of (A) any Law or Governmental Order of the Insureds state of residence 
applicable to the Insured or to any of the Insureds assets, properties or 
business or (B) to the knowledge of the Insured, any other Law or 
Governmental Order applicable to the Insured or to any of the Insureds 
assets, properties or business or (ii) conflict with, result in any breach 
of, constitute a default (or event which with the giving of notice or lapse 
of time, or both, would become a default) under, require any consent under, 
or give to others any rights of termination, amendment or acceleration 
pursuant to any Contract to which the Insured is a party.

29. 	  	No authorization, approval, consent, franchise, license, covenant, 
order, ruling, permit, certification, exemption, notice, declaration or

LIMITED POWER OF ATTORNEY

          Know all by these presents, that the undersigned hereby 
irrevocably constitutes and appoints [COLLATERAL-AGENT], and any officer or 
agent thereof, with full power of substitution, the undersigneds true and 
lawful attorney-in-fact with full irrevocable power and authority in the 
place and stead of the undersigned and in the name of the undersigned or in 
its own name, from time to time, for the limited purpose of carrying out 
the terms of the Collateral Assignment, Loan Agreement or any other 
documents contemplated by the Loan Agreement (capitalized terms used but 
not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned thereto in the Loan 
Application and Agreement between the undersigned and the [LENDER-NAME] 
dated as of [DATE] (the Loan Agreement)) to take any action that the 
Collateral Agent is required to take and to execute and deliver any and all 
documents and instruments necessary or desirable to accomplish the purposes 
of the Collateral Assignment and to effectuate any right assigned to the 
Collateral Agent under the Collateral Assignment (including, without 
limitation, the right to transfer or direct the transfer of ownership of 
the Life Insurance Policy or the proceeds thereof to the Collateral Agent 
or a third party designed by the Collateral Agent upon the sole signature 
of the Collateral Agent following an Event of Default) or Lender under the 
Promissory Note, as the case may be.

          The undersigned hereby ratifies, to the extent permitted by law, 
all that any said attorney shall lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue 
hereof. This power of attorney given as security for indebtedness by the 
undersigned to [LENDER-NAME], being coupled with an interest, shall be 
irrevocable until all Obligations under the Loan Agreement are indefeasibly 
paid in full (in the case of payment obligations) and otherwise satisfied 
and discharged.

          The undersigned expressly authorizes any said attorney-in-fact to 
sign any document on the undersigneds behalf, either by signing the 
undersigneds name or by signing the name of the attorney-in-fact, without 
the need to disclose the fact that said attorney-in-fact is acting as 
attorney-in-fact, and in either event such signature shall have the same 
effect as if the undersigned personally had signed the document. The 
undersigned specifically authorizes my attorney-in-fact so to sign the 
undersigneds name for or in the presence of a notary public as the 
undersigneds notarized signature. The undersigned further authorizes and 
requires all institutions and persons, including banks and insurance 
companies, to accept the signature of said attorney-in-fact with the same 
effect as the undersigneds signature would have.

          The powers conferred on the Collateral Agent pursuant to this 
Limited Power of Attorney are solely to protect the Collateral Agents and 
[LENDER-NAME]s interests in the Life Insurance Policy and shall not impose 
any duty upon the Collateral Agent to exercise any such powers. For the 
avoidance of doubt, nothing herein shall obligate the Collateral Agent to 
take any action with respect to the Life Insurance Policy, including, 
without limitation, selling, transferring or disposing of the Life 
Insurance Policy, and the Collateral Agent shall have the right to do or 
cause to be done all things necessary, proper or advisable to maintain the 
Life Insurance Policy in full force in accordance with its terms.

which recourse shall be had solely to the assets of the Trust, and under no 
circumstances shall [NAME OF TRUSTEE] as trustee of the Trust be personally 
liable for the payment of any indebtedness or expenses of the Trust or be 
liable for the breach or failure of any obligation, representation,

of Attorney to be signed, and this Limited Power of Attorney shall be

1.2. Premium and Trustee Expense Advances.

     (a) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Lender shall cause 
to be made and loaned to the Trust, and the Trust shall borrow, the Advance 
that the Lender may elect to make for the purpose of funding certain 
Premiums and Trustee Expenses during the Term of this Agreement.

     The Advance shall be made on the Initial Premium Funding Date. The 
Advance hereunder may be (a) delivered to the Trust or (b) paid directly to 
the Insurer at the Insurers Mailing Address for Payments with respect to 
the Life Insurance Policy.

     (b) Any Advance for Trustee Expenses may be made at the election of 
the Lender on the Initial Premium Funding Date. If the Lender elects not to 
make an Advance for Trustee Expenses, such Trustee Expenses shall be the 
responsibility of the Trust. The date of any Advance for Trustee Expenses 
may be changed by the Lender. Any Advance for Trustee Expenses may be 
applied by the Lender directly to such expenses.

     (c) Any Advance made hereunder by the Lender shall be evidenced by, 
and repaid with interest in accordance with, the Promissory Note payable to 
the order of the Lender.

1.3. Total Amount Due.

     (a) Interest due under the Promissory Note shall accrue at the 
Interest Rate on the aggregate principal amount of the Advance outstanding 
hereunder on each day from the date of the Advance to the date that the 
Advance plus accrued interest is paid in full. [At the end of each month, 
accrued interest shall be added to the principal amount due under the 
Promissory Note, and interest shall accrue thereafter on such increased 
principal amount.][DELETE IN GEORGIA AND OTHER STATES NOT PERMITTING 
COMPOUNDING OF INTEREST.] Such outstanding principal amount plus any 
accrued and unpaid interest as of any date shall be referred to as the 
Total Amount Due.

     (b) On the Maturity Date, the Trust shall pay to the Lender the Total 
Amount Due under the Promissory Note plus the Origination Fee [plus the 
Lender Protection Insurance Charge].

     (c) Anything contained herein or within the Promissory Note to the 
contrary notwithstanding, if said rate or rates of interest or manner of 
payment exceeds the maximum allowable under applicable law, then the Trust 
shall be liable only for the payment of such maximum as allowed by law, and 
any payment received from the Trust in excess of such legal maximum, 
whenever received, shall be applied to reduce the principal balance of the 
amount due hereunder to the extent of such excess or, at the option of the 
Trust, shall be returned to the Trust.

     (d) The Lender may perform its obligations to compute and determine 
any amounts under this Agreement directly or through an agent. The Lender 
shall not be liable to the Trustee in connection with the performance of 
any such obligations in the absence of willful misconduct or gross 
negligence.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

1.4. Partial and Surplus Payments.

     If at any time the Lender receives a smaller payment than the Total 
Amount Due or any other Obligations due under this Agreement, the 
Promissory Note or the other Financing Documents, it may apply the amount 
actually received in or towards discharge of the Obligations in the order 
indicated by the Promissory Note. If the amount realized by the Lender 
under Article 6 of this Agreement is more than the amount of the 
Obligations, the Lender shall pay the excess to the Trust.

1.5. Dispute Resolution.

     (a) All controversies or disputes arising out of or in connection with 
this Agreement (Disputes) shall be resolved pursuant to this Section 1.5.

     (b) All Disputes shall in the first instance be discussed amicably 
between the parties with a view to resolving such Dispute, commencing upon 
one party giving other parties written notice of such Dispute. In the event 
that such Dispute is not resolved within thirty (30) days after such notice 
(or such longer period as the parties may agree in writing with respect to 
any such Dispute), any party may submit such Dispute to be finally settled 
by arbitration administered under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the 
American Arbitration Association (the Rules) by a panel of three 
arbitrators sitting in [TRUST-CITY-STATE]. One arbitrator shall be 
nominated by the party initiating arbitration at the time of the filing of 
its demand for arbitration, the second arbitrator shall be nominated by the 
opposing party(ies) at the time of the filing of its answering statement, 
and the third arbitrator (who shall act as chairman) shall be jointly 
nominated by party-nominated arbitrators if they are able to agree. If the 
first two party nominated arbitrators are unable to agree upon a third 
within thirty (30) days after the nomination of the second, or if either 
party fails to nominate an arbitrator as set forth herein, an arbitrator 
shall be appointed pursuant to the Rules. The award of the arbitrators 
shall be final and binding upon the parties, and shall not be subject to 
any appeal or review. The parties agree that such award may be recognized 
and enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. The parties agree to 
submit to the personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts sitting 
in [TRUST-CITY-STATE], for the sole purpose of enforcing this Agreement 
(including, where appropriate, issuing injunctive relief), the agreement to 
arbitrate contained herein and any award resulting from arbitration 
pursuant to this Section and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, waive 
any objection which they may have at any time to the laying of venue of any 
proceedings brought in such court and any claim that such proceedings have 
been brought in an inconvenient forum.

     (c) The Trust further agrees that no claim may be brought as a class 
action, and that the Insured and Trustee, on behalf of the Trust, do not 
have the right to act, nor shall they attempt to act, as a class 
representative or participate as a member of a class of claimants with 
respect to any claim related to or arising out of this Agreement. To the 
extent that this arbitration provision is held unenforceable, the Trust: 
(i) irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of any federal or 
state court sitting in [TRUST-CITY-STATE] in respect of any action or 
proceeding arising under or related to in any manner whatsoever this 
Agreement or the transactions contemplated under this Agreement, (ii) 
agrees that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the 
Financing Documents shall in all respects be governed by and construed in 
accordance with the laws of the State of [JURISDICTION] (without reference 
to

conflicts of laws provisions) and (iii) HEREBY WAIVES THE RIGHT SUCH PARTY 
MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY ON ANY CLAIM, COUNTERCLAIM, SETOFF, DEMAND, 
ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION (I) ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO THIS 
AGREEMENT, OR (II) IN ANY WAY IN CONNECTION WITH OR PERTAINING OR RELATED 
TO OR INCIDENTAL TO ANY DEALINGS OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT IN 
CONNECTION WITH THIS DISCLOSURE STATEMENT, REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, 
AND CONSENT OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY PARTYS RIGHTS AND REMEDIES UNDER THIS 
AGREEMENT OR OTHERWISE, OR THE CONDUCT OR THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE PARTIES 
HERETO, IN ALL OF THE FOREGOING CASES WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER 
ARISING AND WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE. The Parties 
hereby agree and acknowledge that this provision is intended to encompass 
any dispute between any Party to this Agreement and any interested third 
party.

     (d) In any arbitral proceeding arising under this Agreement, the 
parties agree that they will engage in cooperative discovery, to be 
supervised by the arbitral tribunal. In its discretion, the tribunal may 
order the exchange of documents in the custody or control of parties to 
this Agreement, and may order a limited number of party depositions of one 
(1) days duration each if requested by the opposing party and if the 
tribunal finds that such depositions would contribute to the efficient 
development of evidence.

     (e) The sole exception to this Section 1.5 involves suits brought on 
behalf of the Lender seeking a temporary restraining order, preliminary 
injunction, and/or permanent injunction (injunctive relief) based upon 
(i) any failure of the Borrower to use the proceeds advanced hereunder 
exclusively as set forth in this Agreement, the Promissory Note, the 
Financing Documents or any other documents related to this Agreement; (ii) 
any act by the Borrower or any Guarantor to transfer, amend, change 
ownership, cancel, convey, sell or assign the Life Insurance Policy without 
the express written consent of the Lender; or (iii) any failure to act by 
the Borrower or any Guarantor that results, directly or indirectly, in the 
transfer of the Life Insurance Policy or any amendment, change of 
ownership, cancellation, conveyance, sale or assignment thereof, in the 
event there is immediate and irreparable injury, loss, or damage (which 
immediate and irreparable injury, loss, or damage may be presumed by law 
and/or by agreement of the Parties).

     (f) The parties hereby expressly agree, and each interested third 
party in receipt of this Agreement acknowledges, that the arbitration 
provisions in this Section 1.5 shall not apply to the Trustee in respect of 
its rights, duties, protections and immunities under the Trust Agreement.

sole and absolute discretion a U.S. Treasury Issue with similar remaining 
time to the end of the applicable prepayment period.

     The Yield Maintenance Premium shall not be less than zero. Further, 
notwithstanding anything else herein to the contrary, in no event shall the 
Yield Maintenance Premium be in an amount which would cause the Borrower to 
pay more upon prepayment of the loan hereunder than the Borrower would have 
paid in full satisfaction of the loan hereunder at maturity on the 
scheduled Maturity Date and to the extent necessary, the Yield Maintenance 
Premium shall be reduced in the least amount needed to comply with this 
limit.

PROMISE TO PAY. [TRUST-NAME] (Borrower) promises to pay to the order of 
[LENDER-NAME] (Lender) in lawful money of the United States of America, 
all principal, together with accrued interest and all other charges, owed 
under the terms of this Promissory Note as hereinafter set forth and the 
Loan Agreement (as defined below). The maximum principal that may be 
advanced to Borrower shall be [PRINCIPAL], or such lesser amount as 
determined in accordance with that certain Loan Application and Agreement 
(the Loan Agreement) of even date herewith between Borrower and Lender 
and Lender shall have no obligation to make any advance in excess of that 
amount. Any advance shall be made under, and in accordance with, the Loan 
Agreement. In the event the unpaid balance of this Promissory Note ever is 
greater than the maximum principal advance, Borrower agrees to repay 
immediately the excess upon Lenders written demand. Capitalized terms used 
but not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned thereto in the Loan 
Agreement.

PAYMENT. The principal amount of this Promissory Note, together with all 
accrued but unpaid interest and all other charges, shall be due and payable 
in full in one lump sum on [MATURITY-DATE], or if earlier, either: (a) one 
(1) Business Day after payment of any proceeds of the Life Insurance Policy 
to or for the benefit of the Borrower; or (b) if the Life Insurance Policy 
is rescinded for any reason, one (1) Business Day after the return of any 
Life Insurance Policy premium. All payments shall be applied in the 
following order: (i) to any collection costs Lender may have incurred in 
procuring Borrowers performance on this Promissory Note; (ii) to any fees 
due under the Loan Agreement; (iii) to the outstanding interest which has 
accrued on the balance of the Promissory Note; and (iv) to the outstanding 
principal balance of the Promissory Note. All interest under the Promissory 
Note shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual 
number of days elapsed in an interest period (actual/360 method). 
Determination of a rate of interest by the Lender shall, in the absence of 
manifest error, be conclusive and binding upon the Borrower. Borrower will 
pay Lender at Lenders address shown above or at such other place as Lender 
may designate in writing. All payments shall be made in lawful money of the 
United States to Lender at the address set forth above or at such other 
place as the Lender under this Promissory Note may designate in writing 
(Payment Address).

INTEREST RATE. The Interest Rate on this Promissory Note shall be set (or 
initially set) at [INTEREST-RATE] per annum [and shall compound on a 
monthly basis][delete in [GEORGIA and other states not permitting 
compounding of interest] and substitute on a simple interest basis]. The 
interest rate on this Promissory Note shall be a [FIXED-FLOATING]. If a 
fixed rate, it shall be fixed at the Interest Rate set forth in the 
preceding sentence; if a floating or variable rate, it shall be reset 
periodically as follows. If the interest rate on this Promissory Note is 
set as variable/floating and not fixed, the Interest Rate shall initially 
be as set forth in the first sentence of this paragraph and shall be 
adjusted thereafter on the first day of each month during the term of this 
Promissory Note. Each date on which the interest rate could vary or change 
is called a Change Date. Beginning with the first Change Date, the 
Interest Rate will be based on an Index plus the Spread. The Index is the 
[INDEX] on the

1

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

Change Date which is publicly announced in the Money Rates section of The 
Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition, or such other similar publication, as 
is reasonably determined by the Lender. If the Index is no longer 
available, the Lender will choose a new index which is based upon 
comparable information. If the Change Date is not a Business Day, the rate 
as announced on the next Business Day shall be used.

On each Change Date, the Lender will calculate the new interest rate by 
adding [SPREAD] basis points (the Spread) to the Index. Subject to the 
limits set forth herein, this amount will be the new interest rate until 
the next Change Date. The interest rate the Borrower is required to pay 
under this Promissory Note will not be greater than 16% or less than 9%. 
Any new interest rate will become effective on each Change Date.

[At the end of each month, accrued interest as calculated above shall be 
added to the principal amount due under the Promissory Note, and interest 
shall accrue thereafter on such increased principal amount.][DELETE IN GA 
and other states not permitting the compounding of interest]

NOTICE: Under no circumstances will the effective rate of interest on this 
Promissory Note be more than the maximum rate allowed by applicable law.

PREPAYMENT. Borrower agrees that all loan fees, including the Origination 
Fee and the Yield Maintenance Premium, and other prepaid finance charges 
are earned fully as of the date of this Promissory Note and will not be 
subject to refund upon early payment (whether voluntary or as a result of 
default), except: (i) in the case of death of the Insured prior to 
maturity, the Yield Maintenance Premium will be waived, or (ii) as 
otherwise required by law. Borrower agrees not to send Lender payments 
marked paid in full, without recourse, or similar language. If Borrower 
sends such a payment, Lender may accept it without losing any of Lenders 
rights under this Promissory Note, and Borrower will remain obligated to 
pay any further amount owed to Lender. All written communications 
concerning disputed amounts, including any check or other payment 
instrument that indicates that the payment constitutes payment in full of 
the amount owed or that is tendered with other conditions or limitations or 
as full satisfaction of a disputed amount must be mailed or delivered to 
the Payment Address. No privilege is reserved by Borrower to prepay any 
principal due hereunder and under the Loan Agreement prior to the Maturity 
Date, except that the Borrower may after giving five (5) days prior 
written notice to Lender, prepay in full, but not in part, all principal 
and interest to and including the date on which payment is made, along with 
all sums, amounts, advances, or charges due under the Loan Agreement, this 
Promissory Note or the other Financing Documents, upon the payment of the 
Yield Maintenance Premium.

LATE CHARGE. Borrower shall pay to Lender a late charge in an amount 
equal to three percent (3%) of any amounts that are not paid within five 
(5) days after the due date thereof to cover the extra expense involved in 
handling delinquent payments. Lenders collection of a late charge 
hereunder shall not be deemed a waiver by Lender of any of its rights under 
this Promissory Note, or any other document between Borrower and Lender.

SECURITY. This Promissory Note is entitled to the benefit of, among other 
things, that certain Assignment Of Life Insurance Policy As Collateral 
(Collateral Assignment) made by Borrower in favor of [________], as 
collateral agent for the Lender (the Collateral Agent), pursuant to which 
the Collateral Agent is granted a first priority security interest in the 
Life Policy (as such term is defined in the Collateral Assignment). This 
Promissory Note shall be subject to the terms and conditions set forth in 
such Collateral Assignment, the Loan Agreement, and the other Financing 
Documents.

INTEREST AFTER DEFAULT. Upon default, all amounts due under this Promissory 
Note shall bear interest from the date of acceleration or maturity at the 
interest rate set forth in this Promissory Note (as it may be adjusted from 
time to time) plus 2% per annum.

DEFAULT. Each of the following shall constitute an event of default (Event 
of Default) under this Promissory Note:

  	  	Payment Default. Borrower fails to make any payment within three (3) 
Business Days after the same becomes due and payable under this Promissory 
Note, the Loan Agreement, or any other Financing Document.

2

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

  	  	Other Defaults. Borrower fails to comply with or to perform any other 
term, obligation, covenant or condition contained in this Promissory Note, 
the Loan Agreement or in any of the other Financing Documents or to comply 
with or to perform any term, obligation, covenant or condition contained in 
any other agreement between Lender and Borrower.

  	  	False Statements. Any warranty, representation or statement made or 
furnished to Lender by Borrower, the Insured or on Borrowers behalf under 
this Promissory Note, the Loan Agreement or any other Financing Document is 
false or misleading in any material respect, either now or at the time made 
or furnished or becomes false or misleading at any time thereafter.

  	  	Related Agreements. The Life Insurance Policy, Promissory Note, Loan 
Agreement, Security Agreement or any other Financing Document ceases to be 
in full force and effect (including failure of any collateral document to 
create a valid and perfected security interest or lien) at any time and for 
any reason; the Borrower becomes a revocable trust, contests the validity 
or enforceability of any Financing Document or denies that it has any 
further liability under any Financing Document to which it is a party, or 
cancels or terminates, or attempts to cancel or terminate, the Life 
Insurance Policy; or the Insurer contests the Life Insurance Policy based 
on the Borrower lacking an insurable interest in the life of the Insured.

  	  	Indebtedness, Creditor or Forfeiture Proceedings. Any garnishment of 
any of Borrowers accounts, attachment, lien, levy, additional encumbrance 
or additional security interest being placed upon any of the Collateral, or 
any commencement of foreclosure or forfeiture proceedings, whether by 
judicial proceeding, self-help, repossession or any other method, by any 
creditor of Borrower or by any governmental agency against any Collateral, 
and which is not discharged in full within one (1) day of the placement 
thereof. However, this Event of Default shall not apply if there is a good 
faith dispute by Borrower as to the validity or reasonableness of the claim 
which is the basis of the creditor or forfeiture proceeding and if Borrower 
gives Lender written notice of the creditor or forfeiture proceeding and 
deposits with Lender monies or a surety bond for the creditor or forfeiture

requested on an expedited basis. All such fees shall be fully earned and 
non-refundable and shall be paid upon Lenders demand (provided, that 
Lender, in its discretion, may add the fees to the principal indebtedness 
due, and accrue interest thereon, and the same shall be due, if not sooner

referred to herein as charge or collect), any amount in the nature of 
interest or in the nature of a fee for this loan, which would in any way or 
event (including demand prepayment, or acceleration) cause Lender to charge 
or collect more for this loan than the maximum Lender would be permitted to 
charge or collect by federal law or the law of the State of [JURISDICTION] 
(as applicable). Any such excess interest or unauthorized fee shall, 
instead of anything stated to the contrary, be applied first to reduce the 
principal balance of the amounts due hereunder to the extent of such excess 
or, at the option of the Borrower, shall be returned to the Borrower. 
Lender may delay or forgo enforcing any of its rights or remedies under 
this Promissory Note without losing them. Borrower and any other person who 
signs, guarantees or endorses this Promissory Note, to the extent allowed

Notwithstanding any provision contained herein to the contrary:

          1. In the event that a Policy Loan is outstanding, is scheduled 
to mature within 60 days (based upon the maturity date specified in the

to the Grantor1 and the beneficiaries of the Trust at the addresses set 
forth in the Trust Agreement (provided, however, that if beneficiaries are 
listed by class, the Trustee shall only be required to deliver such notice 
to the members of such class of beneficiaries identified in a written

Days prior to the maturity date sufficient to permit the Trust to pay the 
Policy Loan in full, that the Trustee is hereby directed to and shall have 
no discretion not to unconditionally and irrevocably transfer and assign 
the Policy to the lender under the Policy Loan (the Lender2) or to a 
designee of the Lender if such designee is specified by the Lender in a 
written notice delivered prior to such transfer and assignment to the 
Trustee (the Designee). If on or before three (3) Business Days prior to 
the maturity date the grantor and/or beneficiaries contribute any funds to 
the Trust, the Trustee shall, within three (3) Business Days after the 
receipt of any funds identified as being contributed by the grantor and/or 
a beneficiary, pay such funds to the Lender. In the event that the insured 
and/or beneficiaries fail to contribute funds to the Trust on or prior to 
such three (3) Business Day period in an amount sufficient to permit the 
Trust to pay all obligations scheduled to be due with respect to the Policy 
Loan on such maturity date (as specified to the Trustee in a written notice 
delivered to the Trustee by the Lender or the Designee), the Trustee is 
hereby directed to and shall have no discretion not to as soon as is 
commercially reasonably practicable thereafter unconditionally and 
irrevocably transfer and assign the Policy and any cash or other assets of 
the Trust to the Lender or the Designee. For purposes hereof, the term 
Policy Loan shall refer to the borrowing effected by the Trust under the 
loan documents referenced in Section [ ] of this Trust Agreement.

          2. Following the maturity of the Policy Loan (whether at stated 
maturity, by acceleration following an event of default or otherwise), if 
(a) the grantor and/or beneficiaries have not contributed funds to the 
Trust on or before three (3) Business Days prior to the maturity date in an 
amount sufficient to permit the Trustee to pay the amount due on the Policy 
Loan in full at the maturity date, as specified to the Trustee in a written 
notice delivered to the Trustee by the Lender, and (b) the Trust does not 
otherwise have sufficient funds to satisfy the Policy Loan in full, 
immediately following receipt by the Trustee of a notice of default from 
the Lender and a written demand for the assignment or transfer of the 
Policy to the Lender or the Designee, the Trustee is hereby directed to and 
shall have no discretion not to as soon as is commercially reasonably 
practicable thereafter unconditionally and irrevocably transfer and assign 
the Policy and any cash or other assets of the Trust to the Lender or the 
Designee.

          3. Any such transfer and assignment of the Policy shall be 
effected by the Trustee executing and delivering on behalf of the Trust to 
the Lender or the Designee as aforesaid (i) a change of owner


 
1 	  	Substitute Settlor for Grantor if state trust law uses Settlor in 
lieu of Grantor.
 
2 	  	For avoidance of doubt, the term Lender shall include any person that 
acquires the Policy Loan, either via purchase and assignment or via a 
participation interest in the loan.

form changing the owner of the Policy to the Lender or the Designee, (ii) a 
change in beneficiary form changing the beneficiary of the Policy to the 
Lender or the Designee and (iii) such other documents or instruments as 
shall be reasonably requested by the Lender for the purpose of effecting 
such changes in owner and beneficiary and the transfer and assignment of 
all right, title and interest in and to the Policy, each of such forms, 
documents or instruments to be in the form provided by Lender to the 
Trustee. Any funds in the Trust to be transferred shall be transferred by 
wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account specified in 
writing by the Lender to the Trustee.

          4. At any time following the receipt of a written notice from the 
Lender stating that an event of default has occurred under the Policy Loan 
and requesting a delivery to the Lender or the Designee of the original 
Policy and all amendments and endorsements thereto and any other documents 
related to such Policy, the Trustee is hereby directed to and shall have no 
discretion not to unconditionally and irrevocably deliver the original 
Policy and such other documents to the Lender or the Designee. If requested 
in writing at any time by the Lender after the execution and delivery of 
the change in owner and change in beneficiary forms referred to in 
paragraph 3 of this Article, the Trustee shall execute all documents 
presented to it for execution by Lender to cause the relevant insurance 
carrier to issue a verification of coverage form indicating that ownership 
of the Policy and the beneficiary under the Policy have been changed to the 
Lender or the Designee.

          5. After the transfer of the Policy and Trust assets as provided 
in Paragraphs (1), (2), (3) and (4) of this Article, the Trustee shall 
thereafter arrange for any filings to be made or actions to be taken by the 
Trustee or the Trust that are required prior to the termination of the 
Trust, including without limitation, the making of any tax or other filings 
required by law. Upon the completion of such filing and the taking of such 
actions, the Trust shall, subject to obtaining the consent of the Lender 
and any Designee, terminate and the Trustee thereafter shall have no 
further duties, obligations or liabilities whatsoever to the grantor or 
beneficiaries hereunder or in connection with or relating to such transfer 
and assignment. The Trustee shall engage, at the expense of the Trust, a 
firm of independent public accountants (the Accountants) to prepare any 
and all tax returns of the Trust that may be required. The Trustee shall 
have no liability with respect to the negligence or misconduct of the 
Accountants and shall only be obligated to (a) execute tax returns 
presented to it by the Accountants and file the same with the appropriate 
tax authorities and (b) pay the tax shown to be due on such tax returns, to 
the to the extent of available funds in the Trust. The Grantor agrees to 
contribute sufficient funds to the Trust to provide for the payment of the 
Accountants tax return preparation fees and to pay any tax shown to be due 
on such tax returns, to the extent that the Trust has insufficient funds 
therefore.

          6. The grantor acknowledges that in the event that the Trustee is 
required to transfer and assign all of the Trusts assets to the Lender 
under the circumstances described above in Paragraphs (1), (2), (3) and (4) 
of this Article, the beneficiaries shall receive no benefits under the 
Trust or any Policy owned by the Trustees.

Spendthrift Clause

Notwithstanding any provision contained herein to the contrary:

          1. Except as may be required in conjunction with any Policy Loan 
or as otherwise provided herein, the interest of any beneficiary in any 
trust created hereunder shall not be transferred, assigned or conveyed and 
shall not be subject to the claims of any creditors of such beneficiary and 
any attempted transfer, assignment or conveyance shall be void and of no 
effect, and the Trustee shall continue distributing trust property directly 
to or for the benefit of such beneficiary as provided for hereunder 
notwithstanding any transfer, assignment or conveyance, and notwithstanding 
any action by creditors.

2

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

          2. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the interest of any beneficiary 
in any trust created hereunder may be pledged to the Lender pursuant to the 
Policy Loan. In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing, immediately upon 
the receipt by the Trustee of a notice of default from the Lender stating 
that the interest of a beneficiary in the Trust has been pledged to the 
Lender pursuant to the Policy Loan and that an event of default has 
occurred under the Policy Loan, and that pursuant to an assignment of 
beneficial interest previously delivered pursuant to a security agreement, 
the interest of the beneficiary in the Trust has been unconditionally and 
irrevocably assigned and transferred to the Lender or the Designee, the 
Trustee shall immediately thereafter reflect on the books and records of 
the Trust the assignment and transfer of such beneficial interest to, and 
the ownership of such beneficial interest by, the Lender or the Designee.

          3. From and after the recordation of such transfer of the 
beneficial interests in the Trust to the Lender or the Designee, the 
Trustee is directed unconditionally and irrevocably not to take any action 
with regard to the Trust or the Policy without the prior written consent of 
the Lender and any such Designee.

          4. In the event the interest of any beneficiary in the Trust 
created hereunder is transferred, assigned and re-titled in the name of the 
Lender or the Designee, as required by paragraph 2 of this clause, the 
Lender or Designee shall have the power and right to direct that the Trust 
be terminated, after which all of the principal thereof, together with 
accumulated income (including any Policy), shall be immediately thereafter 
unconditionally and irrevocably paid and distributed to, or re-titled in 
the name of, the Lender or the Designee by the Trustee.

as owner and/or beneficiary, any policy or policies of insurance on the 
life of the Grantor or the joint lives of the Grantor and any other person 
(a Policy), and may apply for, purchase or enter into any agreement for

          3. The Grantor shall have no incidents of ownership, interest or

connection with any Policy.

          7. The Grantor hereby agrees and, as evidenced by its acceptance 
of any benefits hereunder, any Beneficiary agrees that the Trustee in any 
capacity has not provided and will not provide in the future, any advice,

[LENDER-NAME] (the Lender) is offering a life insurance premium financing 
arrangement (the Financing Arrangement) which provides trusts settled by 
individuals, such as the Grantor, with financing to purchase and maintain a 
life insurance policy (the Policy) on the life of certain qualifying 
individuals, such as the Insured. To obtain financing under the Financing 
Arrangement, the Insured or Grantor must settle (or have settled) a life 
insurance trust (the Life Insurance Trust) under [JURISDICTION] law and 
the Insured must consent (or have consented) to the Life Insurance Trusts 
application for the Policy. The Grantor must have an insurable interest in 
the life of the Insured and all beneficiaries of the Life Insurance Trust 
must be individuals or tax-exempt charities with an insurable interest in 
the life of the Insured or an estate planning vehicle, all of the owners or 
beneficiaries of which have an insurable interest in the life of the 
Insured.

 

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

In order to participate in the Financing Arrangement, the Life Insurance 
Trust was required to execute a Loan Application and Agreement (the Loan 
Agreement) and a Promissory Note in favor of the Lender. Pursuant to the 
Loan Agreement, the Lender will, subject to the terms, provisions and 
conditions of the Loan Agreement, make an advance of funds to, or for the 
benefit of, the Life Insurance Trust for the purpose of funding premiums 
under the Policy. The obligations of the Life Insurance Trust under the 
Loan Agreement are secured by a collateral assignment of the Life Insurance 
Trusts interest in the Policy under a collateral assignment agreement 
between the Life Insurance Trust and the Collateral Agent (the Collateral 
Assignment Agreement). The obligations under the Loan Agreement bear a 
periodic interest at a [FIXED-FLOATING] subject to a minimum interest rate 
of nine percent (9%) (in the case of a floating rate) and will be due and 
payable upon any date that the principal and interest shall become due and 
payable in full under the Loan Agreement, whether at the scheduled maturity 
under the Promissory Note, by acceleration, notice of prepayment, or 
otherwise. The Life Insurance Trust may pre-pay the Loan (including any 
accrued interest), in full but not in part, without penalty other than the 
payment of the Yield Maintenance Premium in some circumstances, as provided 
under the Loan Agreement.

Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings 
assigned thereto in the Loan Agreement.

Each of the following are events of default under the Loan Agreement and 
Financing Documents:

Payment Default. Life Insurance Trust fails to make any payment within 
three (3) Business Days after the same becomes due and payable under the 
Loan Agreement, the Promissory Note or any other Financing Document.

Other Defaults. Life Insurance Trust fails to comply with or to perform any 
other term, obligation, covenant or condition contained in the Promissory 
Note, the Loan Agreement or in any of the other Financing Documents or to 
comply with or to perform any term, obligation, covenant or condition 
contained in any other agreement between Lender and Life Insurance Trust or 
a default occurs under the Promissory Note, Loan Agreement, Security 
Agreement or any other Financing Document.

False Statements. Any warranty, representation or statement made or 
furnished to Lender by the Life Insurance Trust, the Insured or on Life 
Insurance Trusts behalf under the Promissory Note, the Loan Agreement or 
any other Financing Document is false or misleading in any material 
respect, either now or at the time made or furnished or becomes false or 
misleading at any time thereafter.

Related Agreements. The Policy, Promissory Note, Loan Agreement, Security 
Agreement or any other Financing Document ceases to be in full force and 
effect (including failure of any collateral document to create a valid and 
perfected

security interest or lien) at any time and for any reason; the Life 
Insurance Trust becomes a revocable trust, contests the validity or 
enforceability of any Financing Document or denies that it has any further 
liability under any Financing Document to which it is a party, or cancels 
or terminates, or attempts to cancel or terminate, the Policy; or the 
Insurer contests the Policy based on the Life Insurance Trust lacking an 
insurable interest in the life of the Insured.

Indebtedness, Creditor or Forfeiture Proceedings. Any garnishment of any of 
Life Insurance Trusts accounts, attachment, lien, levy, additional 
encumbrance or additional security interest being placed upon any of the 
Collateral, or any commencement of foreclosure or forfeiture proceedings, 
whether by judicial proceeding, self-help, repossession or any other 
method, by any creditor of Life Insurance Trust or by any governmental 
agency against any Collateral, and which is not discharged in full within 
one (1) day of the placement thereof. However, this Event of Default shall 
not apply if there is a good faith dispute by the Life Insurance Trust as 
to the validity or reasonableness of the claim which is the basis of the 
creditor or forfeiture proceeding and if Life Insurance Trust gives Lender 
written notice of the creditor or forfeiture proceeding and deposits with 
Lender monies or a surety bond for the creditor or forfeiture proceeding, 
in an amount determined by Lender, in its sole discretion, as being an 
adequate reserve or bond for the dispute.

Insolvency or Default of Life Insurance Trust. The Life Insurance Trust is: 
(i) dissolved, liquidated or terminated; (ii) is unable to pay its debts as 
they mature; (iii) makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors; (iv) 
is bankrupt or insolvent; (v) seeks appointment of, or becomes the subject

an involuntary case under federal bankruptcy law; (viii) the Life Insurance 
Trust defaults under any loan, extension of credit, security agreement,

property or Life Insurance Trusts ability to repay the Promissory Note or 
perform Life Insurance Trusts Obligations under the Promissory Note, the 
Loan Agreement or any of other Financing Documents; or (ix) Life Insurance 
Trust violates any Law.

Insolvency or Default of Insured or Guarantor. The Insured or any 
Guarantor: (i) makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors; (ii) is 
adjudicated a bankrupt or insolvent; (iii) seeks appointment of, or becomes 
the subject of an order appointing, a trustee, conservator, or receiver as 
to all or part of his assets; (iv) commences, approves or consents to, or 
is the debtor in, any case or proceeding under any bankruptcy or similar

commencement; (v) is the subject of an order for relief in an involuntary 
case under federal bankruptcy law; (vi) Life Insurance` Trust defaults

the Guaranty.

Events Affecting Guarantor. Any of the preceding events occurs with respect 
to any Guarantor of any of the indebtedness under the Promissory Note or 
any Guarantor dies or becomes incompetent, or revokes or disputes the 
validity of, or liability under, any guaranty of the indebtedness evidenced 
by the Promissory Note; in the event of a death, Lender, at its option, 
may, but shall not be required to, permit the Guarantors estate to assume 
unconditionally the obligations arising under the guaranty in a manner 
satisfactory to Lender, and, in doing so, cure any Event of Default.

Adverse Change. A material adverse change occurs in Life Insurance Trusts 
financial condition, or Lender believes the prospect of payment or 
performance of the Obligations is materially impaired.

Cure Provisions. Other than as set forth in the preceding clauses of this 
Section, failure by the Life Insurance Trust or Beneficiary, as applicable, 
to perform in any material respect any of its obligations under the 
Promissory Note, Loan Agreement, Security Agreement or any other Financing 
Document to which either is a party if such failure is not remedied on or 
prior to the fifteenth (15th) day after written notice of such failure is 
given to the Life Insurance Trust or the Beneficiary, respectively, by the 
Lender.

In connection with, and as a condition precedent to the Life Insurance 
Trust obtaining a loan from the Lender in connection with the Financing 
Arrangement, the undersigned on behalf of the Life Insurance Trust hereby 
acknowledges, represents, warrants, covenants and agrees to the following:

1. 	  	The Trustee has not taken any action to dissolve the Life Insurance 
Trust, and to the actual knowledge of the Trustee, no voluntary, 
involuntary or judicial actions have been taken to dissolve the Life 
Insurance Trust.
 
2. 	  	In the event the Trustee receives written notice that the Policy is 
Contested (as defined below) at any time that any amount remains owing 
under the Loan Agreement, the Trustee shall, within three (3) business days 
of its receipt thereof, forward such communications and all documents 
relating to such Contest to the Lender. The Life Insurance Trust agrees to 
cooperate fully in a defense against any Contest. Contested means, with 
respect to a Policy, the denial of a claim for benefits under, or the 
assertion of a right by the issuer of such Policy to cancel

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

  	  	or rescind the Policy pursuant to the suicide or contestability 
provisions thereof or otherwise.

3. 	  	The copy of the trust agreement of the Life Insurance Trust (the 

accurate, and has not been amended, revoked or otherwise changed since the 
date adopted.
 
4. 	  	The execution, performance and delivery of the Financing Arrangement 
Documents are in accordance with, and do not violate, the Trust Agreement. 
Amounts received by the Trustee under the Life Insurance Trust may be used 
or applied only in accordance with the Trust Agreement.
 
5. 	  	There may be federal, state or local income, gift or estate tax 
effects of participation in the Financing Arrangement to the Life Insurance 
Trust. Participation in the Financing Arrangement, and termination of 
participation, could increase the taxable income, taxable gifts or taxable 
estate of a participant. The Life Insurance Trust has not relied upon any 
advice from the Lender, any life agent or other producer, any insurance 
company that has issued the Policy or any other person associated with the 
Financing Arrangement regarding any such tax effects.
 
6. 	  	The Life Insurance Trust and the Trustee have not been paid, 
directly or indirectly, any inducement (money, property or otherwise) in 
connection with the Financing Arrangement or to obtain the Policy other 
than reasonable and customary fees for services as Trustee.
 
7. 	  	None of the Life Insurance Trust, to the actual knowledge of the 
Trust, the Grantor, the Insured, the Insureds Spouse or any beneficiary of 
the Life Insurance Trust has any present intention to surrender, sell or 
settle, directly or indirectly, the Policy or any interest therein.
 
8. 	  	To the knowledge of the Life Insurance Trust, the Policy application 
has been completed accurately and to the knowledge of the Life Insurance 
Trust there are no material omissions or misstatements in the application.
 
9. 	  	The Lender, or any subsequent owner of the Loan Agreement, may sell, 
or sell participations in, the Loan Agreement without the consent of, or 
prior notice to, the Grantor, the Insured, the Insureds Spouse or the Life 
Insurance Trust and the Life Insurance Trust agrees to take all actions 
(but at no cost or expense to the Life Insurance Trust) requested by the 
Lender in connection with any such sale or participation.
 
10. 	  	The Life Insurance Trust (i) has not entered into any contracts or 
agreements, other than the Policy and the Financing Arrangement Documents 
and (ii) after the date hereof, will not, without the prior written consent 
of Lender (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld) enter into any 
contract or agreement which

5

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

  	  	could be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Life 
Insurance Trusts ability to perform its obligations under any Financing 
Arrangement Document or which could adversely effect Lenders rights under 
any Financing Arrangement Documents (as determined by Lender).

11. 	  	Any claims, questions or controversies arising under or related to 
in any manner whatsoever this Disclosure Statement or the transactions 
contemplated under the Financing Arrangement including, but not limited to, 
any challenge by the Life Insurance Trust against the Lender, its designees 
and/or third party servicers, any broker, any insurance company or any 
other party interested in or related in any way to the Financing 
Arrangement (each, an Interested Third Party, notwithstanding the fact 
such parties are not signatories hereto) (a Dispute) shall be submitted 
to arbitration conducted before the American Arbitration Association (the 
AAA). The Life Insurance Trust is hereby authorized to invoke this 
arbitration provision, and any judgment with respect to any award rendered 
pursuant to this arbitration provision may be entered in any court of 
competent jurisdiction. Such arbitration will be conducted under the rules 
of the AAA and the laws of the State of [JURISDICTION] and will be 
conducted in [TRUST-CITY-STATE]. The Life Insurance Trust understands that 
claims submitted to arbitration are not heard by a jury and are not subject 
to the rules governing the courts. The Life Insurance Trust further agrees 
that no claim may be brought as a class action, and that the Life Insurance 
Trust has no right to act, nor shall attempt to act, as a class 
representative or participate as a member of a class of claimants with 
respect to any claim related to or arising out of the Financing 
Arrangement. To the extent that this arbitration provision is held 
unenforceable, the Life Insurance Trust: (i) irrevocably submits to the 
exclusive jurisdiction of any federal or state court sitting in 
[TRUST-CITY-STATE] in respect of any action or proceeding arising under or 
related to in any manner whatsoever this Disclosure Statement or the 
transactions contemplated under the Financing Arrangement, (ii) agrees that 
this Disclosure Statement and the transactions contemplated by the

WITH THIS DISCLOSURE STATEMENT OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY OF ITS RIGHTS AND 
REMEDIES UNDER THIS DISCLOSURE STATEMENT OR OTHERWISE, OR THE CONDUCT OR 
THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE PARTIES HERETO, IN ALL OF THE FOREGOING CASES 
WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING AND WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT, 
TORT OR OTHERWISE. The sole exception to this requirement for arbitration 
involves suits brought on behalf of the Lender seeking a temporary

injunction (injunctive relief) based upon (i) any failure of the Life 
Insurance Trust to use the proceeds of advanced exclusively as set forth in

  	Re:  	  	Imperial Life Financing II, LLC, a Georgia limited liability 
company (the Borrower)

Ladies and Gentlemen:

     We have acted as special counsel for the Borrower, Imperial Premium 
Finance, LLC, a Florida limited liability company (Imperial) and Jonathan 
Neuman and Antony Mitchell (each an Individual Guarantor and 
collectively, the Individual Guarantors and together with the Borrower

     1. A copy of the Articles of Organization of Borrower, filed with the 
Secretary of State of Georgia on February 5, 2009, and certified as of a 
recent date;

     2. A copy of the Articles of Organization of Imperial, filed with the 
Secretary of State of Florida on December 14, 2006, and certified as of a 
recent date;

     3. A certificate issued by the Office of the Secretary of State of 
Florida, dated as of a recent date, indicating that Imperial is duly 
formed, in good standing and validly existing as of such date;

     4. A copy of Limited Liability Company Agreement of Borrower; and

     5. A copy of Limited Liability Company Agreement of Imperial.

     As to questions of fact material to this opinion, we have relied upon 
statements and certificates of the Credit Parties and public officials. We 
have made no independent investigation of the warranties and 
representations made by the Credit Parties in the Documents or of any 
related matters.

     Based on the foregoing, and subject to the limitations, qualifications 
and assumptions set forth herein, we are of the opinion that:

     1. Imperial is a duly formed and validly existing limited liability 
company under the laws of the State of Florida, with the limited liability 
company power under the Florida Limited Liability Company Act and its 
Limited Liability Company Agreement to execute and deliver the Documents to 
which it is a party and to perform Imperials obligations thereunder.

     2. Based solely on the good standing certificate issued by the Utah 
Department of Commerce, Imperial is duly qualified and in good standing as 
a foreign corporation qualified to do business in Utah.

     3. The execution, delivery and performance of the Documents and the 
Collateral Value Policy and the Contingent Lender Protection Insurance 
Policy have been duly authorized by all necessary limited liability company 
action on the part of Imperial under the Limited Liability Company 
Agreement of Imperial and have been duly executed and delivered by the 
Credit Parties party thereto.

     4. The execution and delivery by the Credit Parties of the Documents 
to which they are a party and the performance of their respective 
obligations thereunder (a) do not violate such Credit Partys certificate 
of formation or its limited liability company agreement; (b) do not 
violate, breach or result in a default under any Transaction Document 
listed on Exhibit B hereof to which such Credit Party is bound, (c) to 
our knowledge, do not result in the creation or imposition of a lien, 
charge or encumbrance upon such Credit Party or any of the property or 
assets of such Credit Party (other than pursuant to the Loan Documents), 
(d) do not violate the Florida Limited Liability

its operations or any of its properties.

     6. No consent, authorization or approval by, and no notice to or 
filing with, any Federal, Florida or New York governmental authority is 
required (a) in connection with the due execution, delivery and performance 
by any Credit Party of any Document to which such Person is a party, or (b) 
for the grant by any Credit Party pursuant to any Loan Document, or the 
perfection, of any lien or security interest purported to be created 
thereby in any Collateral, other than (i) the filing of the Imperial 
Financing Statement, which has been filed, and (ii) those which have 
already been obtained.

     7. Each Opinion Document constitutes the legal, valid and binding 
obligation of the Credit Party which is a party thereto, enforceable 
against such Credit Party in accordance with its terms, except as they may 
be qualified below.

     8. To the extent a security interest may be created under Article 9 of 
the Uniform Commercial Code as currently in effect in the State of New York 
(the New York UCC), the Security Agreement creates a valid security 
interest in favor of the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Agents and

extent a security interest may be created under Article 9 of the New York 
UCC, the Imperial Security

Agreement creates a valid security interest in favor of the Collateral 
Agent for the benefit of the Agents and the Lenders in the Collateral 
purported to be covered thereby.

     9. The Imperial Financing Statement is in appropriate form for filing 
with the Florida Secured Transaction Registry (the Imperial Filing 
Office). The description of the Collateral set forth in the Imperial 
Financing Statement is sufficient to perfect a security interest in the 
items and types of Collateral in which a security interest may be perfected 
by the filing of a financing statement under Article 9 of the Uniform 
Commercial Code as currently in effect in the State of Florida (the 
Florida UCC).

     10. With respect to that portion of the collateral described in the 
Imperial Security Agreement in which a security interest may be perfected 
by the filing of a financing statement with the Imperial Filing Office, the 
filing and recording of the Imperial Financing Statement results in the 
perfection of a security interest in Imperials interest in such collateral 
under Article 9 of the Florida UCC.

     11. Other than nominal recording or filing fees, no fees, taxes or 
other charges are due or payable in the State of Florida in connection with 
the execution, delivery, filing or recordation of Imperial Financing 
Statement.

     12. Assuming (i) that the Collateral Agent has taken and is retaining 
possession in the State of New York of (a) the stock certificates 
evidencing the Pledged Shares, together with properly completed stock 
powers endorsing the Pledged Shares and executed by the pledgors owning 
such stock in blank, and (b) the promissory notes representing the Pledged 
Debt (as defined in the Security Agreement) and such promissory notes have 
been properly endorsed, and (ii) the Collateral Agent has taken such 
Pledged Shares and Pledged Debt in good faith without notice having been 
acquired by the Collateral Agent or any Lender of any adverse claim within 
the meaning of the New York UCC, there has been created under the Security 
Agreement and Imperial Security Agreement, and there has been granted to 
the Collateral Agent, a valid and perfected security interest in the 
Pledged Shares and Pledged Debt prior to all other security interests. The 
opinions in this paragraph 12 with respect to Pledged Debt is limited 
solely to Pledged Debt in the form of promissory notes meeting all of the 
requirements set forth in paragraph (xviii) below.

     13. We have no actual knowledge of any pending or threatened action, 
suit or proceeding affecting any Credit Party before any court, arbitrator, 
or Governmental Authority which may materially and adversely affect (i) the 
financial condition, business, performance, properties, operations or 
prospects of any Credit Party, (ii) the ability of any Credit Party to 
perform the obligations of such Person under any Document to which it is a 
party, (iii) the legality, validity or enforceability of any Document, (iv) 
the rights and remedies of any Agent or any Lender under any Opinion 
Document, or (v) the creation, perfection or priority of the Lien of the 
Collateral Agent on any of the Collateral securing the Obligations.

     14. None of the Credit Parties is an investment company registered 
or required to be registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as 
amended, or controlled by such a company.

     15. Assuming that the Opinion Documents are governed by the law of the 
State of Florida for the purpose of the opinion set forth in this 
paragraph, and assuming further that all interest, including all charges, 
fees and penalties in the nature of interest, charged or paid in respect of 
the Term Loan will not exceed, in the aggregate, 25% per annum simple 
interest on the actual principal outstanding from time to time, the Loan 
Documents do not violate any usury laws of the State of Florida.

Parties, that such other parties have the corporate or other entity power 
to enter into and perform all obligations under such documents, the due 
authorization by all requisite corporate or other entity action of the 
execution, delivery and performance of the documents by such other parties, 
and the validity, enforceability and binding effect of those documents as 
and to and on such other parties; and that the execution and delivery of 
such documents by such other parties was unconditional, except for 
conditions to closing expressly set forth within such documents;

          (iv) All applicable Documents have been or will be duly filed, 
indexed, and recorded among the appropriate official records, with all 
fees, charges and taxes having been paid.

          (v) The parties to the Documents and their successors and assigns 
will (i) act in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner in the 
exercise of any rights or enforcement of any remedies under the Documents; 
(ii) not engage in any conduct in the exercise of such rights or 
enforcement of such remedies that would constitute other than fair dealing; 
and (iii) comply with all requirements of applicable procedural and 
substantive law in exercising any rights or enforcing any remedies under 
the Documents.

and in respect of which no Liens have attached to or been filed against the

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

          (v) Quality of Title. No effective financing statement or other 
similar instrument is in effect covering any of the Insurance Premium Loans 
that have been transferred hereunder or any interest therein that has been 
filed, authorized, acknowledged or otherwise permitted by the Assignor or 
any Affiliate thereof in any recording office except for financing 
statements that may be filed (x) in favor of the Collateral Agent in 
accordance with the Security Agreement, and/or (y) in favor of the Assignor 
under the related Loan Document Package.

               3. Representations and Warranties of the Assignee. The 
Assignee hereby represents and warrants to the Assignor as of the 
Settlement Date that:

          (a) Organization and Good Standing. The Assignee has been duly 
organized and is validly existing as a limited liability company in good 
standing under the laws of the State of Illinois, and has power and 
authority to own its properties and to conduct its business as such 
properties shall be currently owned and such business is presently 
conducted.

          (b) Power and Authority. The Assignee shall have the power and 
authority to execute and deliver this Assignment Agreement and to carry out 
its terms; the Assignee shall have full power and authority to purchase the 
property to be purchased and shall have duly authorized such purchase; and 
the execution, delivery and performance of this Assignment Agreement shall 
have been duly authorized by the Assignee by all necessary action.

          (c) Binding Obligation. This Assignment Agreement shall 
constitute a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Assignee 
enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be 
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other 
similar laws affecting creditors rights generally or by general principles 
of equity.

     The representations and warranties set forth in Section 2 and Section 
3 of this Assignment Agreement shall survive the sale of the interests by 
the Assignor to the Assignee pursuant to this Assignment Agreement. Upon 
discovery by the Assignor or the Assignee of a breach of any of the 
foregoing representations and warranties, the party discovering such breach 
shall give prompt written notice to the other.

               4. Remedies.

          (a) Repurchase of interests for Certain Breaches. In the event of 
a breach of any representations and warranties set forth in Section 2(e), 
(f), (g), (h), (k), (o) or (v), upon the earlier to occur of the discovery 
of such breach by the Assignor or receipt by the Assignor of written notice 
of such breach given by or on behalf of the Assignee, the Assignees 
interest in each Insurance Premium Loan relating to such breach shall be 
repurchased by the Assignor from the Assignee and upon such repurchase 
shall terminate and be extinguished.

          (b) Reconveyed Insurance Premium Loans. Upon the repurchase by 
the Assignor of any interest under this Assignment Agreement, then, on the 
date required for such repurchase, the Assignor shall deposit into the 
Collection Account in immediately available funds an amount equal to the 
outstanding principal balance of the affected Insurance Premium Loans on 
the date of such repurchase, together with accrued and unpaid interest 
thereon through such date at the interest rate per annum on the Loans under 
the Financing Agreement. Such deposit shall be considered payment in full 
for such interest.

5

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

          In connection with the preceding paragraph, the Assignee shall 
execute such documents and instruments of transfer or assignment as shall 
be prepared by the Assignor, and shall take such other actions as shall 
reasonably be requested by the Assignor, to effect the repurchase of the 
interests from the Assignee. Upon repurchase of the interests in Insurance 
Premium Loans from the Assignee, the Assignee shall automatically and 
without further action be deemed to transfer, assign, set over and 
otherwise convey to or upon the order of the Assignor, without recourse, 
representation or warranty, all the right, title and interest of the 
Assignee in and to the reconveyed interest and all Collections with respect 
thereto and all proceeds thereof received after the date of such 
repurchase.

               5. Covenants of the Assignor. The Assignor hereby covenants 
that:

          (a) No Impairment. Except in accordance with, or as contemplated 
by, the Loan Documents and the Transaction Documents, the Assignor shall 
take no action, nor omit to take any action, which would impair the rights 
of the Assignee in any Insurance Premium Loan in which an interest has been 
transferred hereunder.
 
          (b) Compliance with Law. The Assignor will comply in all material 
respects with all Requirements of Law with respect to it, its business and 
properties and the Insurance Premium Loans and related Life Insurance 
Policies. The Assignor will maintain all applicable permits, certifications 
and licenses (including all licenses to originate Insurance Premium Loans) 
necessary with respect to its business and properties and all Insurance 
Premium Loans and the Life Insurance Policy related thereto.
 
          (c) Preservation of Existence. The Assignor will preserve and 
maintain its existence, rights, franchises and privileges as a limited 
liability company or corporation, as applicable, and become and remain 
licensed in each jurisdiction where the failure to maintain such license 
would materially and adversely affect (A) the interests of the Assignee 
hereunder or (B) the collectibility of any Insurance Premium Loans in which 
an interest has been transferred hereunder or the related Life Insurance 
Policies; and the Assignor shall not consolidate with or merge into any 
other Person or convey or transfer its properties and assets substantially 
as an entirety to any Person without the prior written consent of the 
Assignee.
 
          (d) Performance and Compliance with Insurance Premium Loans. The 
Assignor will, at its expense, timely and fully perform and comply with all 
provisions, covenants and other promises required to be observed by it 
hereunder. The Assignor shall comply with and perform its obligations with 
respect to any Insurance Premium Loan.
 
          (e) Collections and Payments. Except as otherwise provided in 
this Assignment Agreement, the Assignor will cause any Collections received 
by it to be deposited in the Collection Account no later than the Business 
Day following the receipt and identification of proceeds.
 
          (f) Arms-Length Relationship; Separate Existence. The Assignor 
will maintain an arms-length relationship with the Assignee. Any 
transaction between the Assignee on the one hand and the Assignor or any 
respective Affiliates thereof, on the other hand, will, in the

6

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

reasonable judgment of the Assignor, be fair and equitable to the Assignee. 
The Assignor shall not acquire any obligations of the Assignee.

          (g) Responsibility of Assignor. The Assignor will not agree to 
be, or hold itself out to be, responsible for the debts of the Assignee or 
for the decisions or actions with respect to the daily business and affairs 
of the Assignee.

          (h) Reporting Requirements.

     (i) As soon as possible and in any event within ten (10) Business Days 
after the Assignor obtains knowledge thereof, the Assignor shall notify the 
Assignee of any litigation, investigation or proceeding that could 
reasonably be expected to impair in any material respect the ability of the 
Assignor to perform its obligations under this Assignee Agreement.

     (ii) The Assignor shall promptly deliver to the Assignee such other 
information, documents, records or reports regarding the Insurance Premium 
Loans in which an interest has been transferred hereunder and related Life 
Insurance Policies as the Assignee may from time to time reasonably request 
in order to protect the Assignees interests under or as contemplated by 
this Assignment Agreement..

          (i) No Bankruptcy Filing Against Assignee. The Assignor will not 
commence, institute or cause to be commenced or instituted any bankruptcy, 
reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings, or 
other proceedings under any United States federal or state bankruptcy or 
similar law, against the Assignee or join in the commencement of any 
proceeding against the Assignee under any such law.

          (j) Insurance Premium Loans. After the Effective Date, the 
Assignor will not sell or assign any interests in more than two (2) out of 
every three (3) Insurance Premium Loans to any Person other than the 
Assignee until the Commitments under the Financing Agreement have been 
terminated; provided, that the Assignor is acting in good faith in 
connection with such sales or assignments and has not selected the 
Insurance Premium Loans to be sold and assigned to the Assignee based on 
the perceived quality of credit of any Insurance Premium Loan.

               6. Sale. It is the intention of the parties that the 
conveyance of the Insurance Premium Loans hereunder constitute a sale and 
not pledges of security for a loan and the parties will treat such 
conveyance as a sale for tax and accounting purposes. The parties 
acknowledge and agree that the transactions contemplated by this Assignment 
Agreement shall be, and shall be treated as a purchase by the Assignor and 
a sale by the Assignee of the Insurance Premium Loans hereunder, and not as 
a lending transaction or the grant of a security interest in the Insurance 
Premium Loans hereunder, such that the Insurance Premium Loans hereunder 
shall not be part of the bankruptcy estate of the Assignor under Section 
541 of the Bankruptcy Code or subject to the automatic stay under Section 
362 of the Bankruptcy Code or any similar law. However, if the conveyances 
of such Insurance Premium Loans were not characterized by a court of law as 
sales of Insurance Premium Loans or a court of law determined that the 
consideration for the conveyance of the Insurance Premium Loans hereunder 
did not represent fair value, then such conveyances of such Insurance 
Premium Loans shall be considered a capital contribution to the Assignee 
(or, in the case where the consideration for the conveyances of the

7

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

Insurance Premium Loans did not represent fair value, capital contributions 
to the extent of any shortfall in fair value).

               7. Settlement Date. Following the execution of this 
Assignment Agreement by the Assignor and the Assignee, it will be delivered 
by the Assignor to the Collateral Agent and the Insurance Collateral Agent. 
The effective date of this Assignment Agreement (the Settlement Date) 
shall be the latest of (a) the date of the execution hereof by the Assignor 
and the Assignee, (b) the date this Assignment Agreement has been delivered 
to the Collateral Agent and the Insurance Collateral Agent, (c) the 
settlement date specified on Annex I, and (d) the receipt by Assignor of 
the Purchase Price specified in Annex I.

               8. Rights. As of the Settlement Date (a) the Assignee shall 
be a party to the Loan Documentation Package and, to the extent of the 
interest assigned pursuant to this Assignment Agreement, have the rights 
and obligations of a Lender thereunder, and (b) the Assignor shall, to the 
extent of the interest assigned pursuant to this Assignment Agreement, 
subject to the provisions of any Servicing Agreement, relinquish its rights 
and be released from its obligations under the Loan Documentation Package.

               9. Adjustments. The Assignor and the Assignee shall make all 
appropriate adjustments in payments under the Loan Documentation Package 
for periods prior to the Settlement Date directly between themselves on the 
Settlement Date.

               10. Governing Law. THIS ASSIGNMENT AGREEMENT SHALL BE 
GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE 
STATE OF NEW YORK.

               11. Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES 
ANY RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM 
BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF THIS ASSIGNMENT AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE 
TRANSACTIONS RELATED HERETO, AND AGREES THAT ANY SUCH ACTION, PROCEEDING OR 
COUNTERCLAIM SHALL BE TRIED BEFORE A COURT AND NOT BEFORE A JURY.

               12. Counterparts. This Assignment Agreement may be executed 
in any number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate 
counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be deemed 
an original, but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the 
same agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart of this Assignment 
Agreement by facsimile or electronic mail shall be equally effective as 
delivery of an original executed counterpart.

               13. Indemnification. Without limiting any other rights that 
the Assignee may have hereunder or under any applicable law, the Assignor 
hereby agrees to indemnify the Assignee and the Indemnitees from and 
against any and all amounts awarded against or incurred by any of them, and 
arising out of or resulting from this Assignment Agreement or the 
activities of the Assignor in connection herewith or in respect of any 
Insurance Premium Loan in which an interest has been transferred hereunder 
or related Life Insurance Policy that are sustained as a result of:

8

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

     (i) any representation, warranty or covenant made by the Assignor 
under this Assignment Agreement, or any other document, certificate or 
report delivered by the Assignor hereunder that was incorrect in any 
material respect when made or deemed made or that the Assignor failed to 
perform;

     (ii) the failure by the Assignor to comply with this Assignment 
Agreement, the Transaction Documents, the Loan Documents, or any 
Requirement of Law with respect to any Insurance Premium Loan or Life 
Insurance Policy;

     (iii) any commingling by the Assignor of Collections with other funds 
of the Assignor or any of its Affiliates; or

     (iv) any breach by the Assignor of any obligation under any Insurance 
Premium Loan in which an interest has been transferred hereunder or related 
Life Insurance Policy.

     The foregoing indemnity excludes (a) losses on Insurance Premium Loans 
in which an interest has been transferred hereunder to the extent 
reimbursement therefor would constitute credit recourse to the Assignor for 
nonpayment of any Insurance Premium Loan in which an interest has been 
transferred hereunder by the related obligor and (b) any income or 
franchise taxes or similar taxes (or any interest or penalties on them).

               14. Amendment. This Assignment Agreement may be amended from 
time to time by the Assignor and the Assignee in writing with the prior 
written consent of the Agents and the Required Lenders. Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, the parties hereby agree that no amendment, modification or 
waiver of, or consent with respect to, any provision of this Assignment 
Agreement that (a) prior to the occurrence of a Credit Event (as defined in 
the Collateral Value Insurance Policy) would, in the reasonable belief of 
any party hereto, be likely to adversely affect the interests of the 
Collateral Value Insurer shall in any event be made or become effective 
unless the same shall be consented to by the Collateral Value Insurer in 
writing or (b) following the occurrence of a Credit Event, would, in the 
reasonable belief of any party hereto, be likely to adversely affect the 
interests of the Contingent Collateral Value Insurer shall in any event be 
made or become effective unless the same shall be consented to by the 
Contingent Collateral Value Insurer in writing. In all events, copies of 
any amendments to this Agreement shall be promptly provided to (x) the 
Collateral Value Insurer prior to the occurrence of a Credit Event and (y) 
the Contingent Collateral Value Insurer following the occurrence of a 
Credit Event, by the Assignee following execution thereof. Each of the 
parties hereto agrees that the Collateral Value Insurer and the Contingent 
Collateral Value Insurer are third party beneficiaries solely with respect 
to this Section 14, and shall have no rights with respect to any other 
provisions of this Assignment Agreement. Each of the parties hereto agrees 
that the each of the Agents and the Lenders is a third party beneficiary 
with respect to this Assignment Agreement.

EXHIBIT J

          This MASTER PARTICIPATION AGREEMENT, dated as of March _____,

parties hereby agree as follows:

particular provision of this Agreement; article, section, subsection, 
exhibit and schedule references contained in this Agreement are references 
to articles, sections, subsections, exhibits and schedules in or to this 
Agreement unless otherwise specified; with respect to all terms in this 
Agreement, the singular includes the plural and the plural the singular;

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 


ARTICLE II.

TRANSFERS OF INTERESTS IN INSURANCE PREMIUM LOANS

          SECTION 2.01 Transfers of Interests in Insurance Premium Loans. 
On the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, the 
Originator shall, on the Effective Date and from time to time thereafter, 
sell and transfer to the Participant without recourse, and the Participant 
shall, on the Effective Date and from time to time thereafter purchase from 
the Originator (any such sale, transfer, purchase and acquisition is herein 
referred to as a Transfer), a participation interest in each Insurance 
Premium Loan originated by the Originator in an Applicable Licensed State.


ARTICLE III.

PARTICIPATIONS

          SECTION 3.01 Transfers. (a) On the terms and conditions set forth 
herein, during the Effective Period and on and as of the related Transfer 
Effective Date, the Originator hereby sells, transfers and assigns to the 
Participant, and the Participant hereby purchases and acquires from the 
Originator, with respect to each Insurance Premium Loan made by the 
Originator in an Applicable Licensed State identified in a Participation 
Certificate (as defined herein), a participation evidencing a 100% 
undivided beneficial ownership interest (each, a Participation) in all of 
the Originators right, title and interest in, to and under (i) such 
Insurance Premium Loan, the related promissory note and all other documents 
in the Loan Documentation Package for such Insurance Premium Loan and all 
right, title and interest of the Originator in the Collateral (including 
any related Life Insurance Policies) and (ii) all Collections thereon 
received by the Originator on or after the Transfer Effective Date, 
including all cash proceeds received with respect to such Insurance Premium 
Loans and all related security (including proceeds as defined in the UCC 
of the jurisdiction whose law governs the perfection of an interest in such 
Insurance Premium Loans). On each Transfer Effective Date, the Participant 
and the Originator shall execute a participation certificate in the form of 
Exhibit B attached hereto (each a Participation Certificate). Each 
Participation Certificate shall be deemed to incorporate in its entirety, 
the terms and conditions of this Agreement and all representations, 
warranties, agreements and covenants made hereunder shall be deemed to have 
been made in respect of the Insurance Premium Loans the subject of the 
Participation Certificate as of the applicable Transfer Effective Date.

               (b) The parties acknowledge and agree that (i) the 
conveyance of the Insurance Premium Loans is being effected hereunder by 
Participations instead of outright assignments and (ii) accordingly, the 
sale, transfer, assignment and conveyance of the Participations in the 
Insurance Premium Loans hereunder shall have the consequence that the 
Originator holds legal title and not an equitable interest in such 
Insurance Premium Loans and the Participant holds 100% of the equitable 
interest in such Insurance Premium Loans. The Originator acknowledges and 
agrees that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, it holds 
legal title to such Insurance Premium Loans as trustee for the benefit of 
the Participant and its successors and assigns. However, notwithstanding 
any other provision herein, the Originator and the Participant agree and 
acknowledge that the Originator shall remain the lender of record on all 
Insurance Premium Loans in which a Participation has been transferred 
hereunder. The

2

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

parties acknowledge and agree that the transactions contemplated by this 
Agreement shall be, and shall be treated as a purchase by the Participant 
and a sale by the Originator of Participations in the Insurance Premium 
Loans hereunder, and not as a lending transaction or the grant of a 
security interest in Participations in the Insurance Premium Loans 
hereunder, such that the Participations in the Insurance Premium Loans 
hereunder shall not be part of the bankruptcy estate of the Originator 
under Section 541 of the Bankruptcy Code or subject to the automatic stay 
under Section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code or any similar law.

               (c) Subject to Section 5.03, the Participations sold, 
transferred, assigned and conveyed hereunder in such Insurance Premium 
Loans are final and irrevocable from and after the Transfer Effective Date, 
and neither the Participant nor the Originator shall have any right to 
require that any such Participation terminate or be repurchased by the 
Originator from the Participant and be extinguished.

               (d) It is the intention of the parties that the conveyance 
of the Insurance Premium Loans to the Participant effected by this 
Agreement constitute sales of Participations in such Insurance Premium 
Loans and not pledges of security for a loan. However, if the conveyances 
of such Insurance Premium Loans were not characterized by a court of law as 
sales of Participations or a court of law determined that the consideration 
for the Participations did not represent fair value, then such conveyances 
of such Insurance Premium Loans shall be considered a capital contribution 
to the Participant (or, in the case where the consideration for the 
Participations did not represent fair value, capital contributions to the 
extent of any shortfall in fair value).

          SECTION 3.02 Payment of Purchase Price. In consideration of the 
Transfer of each Participation from the Originator to the Participant as 
provided in Section 3.01, on each Transfer Effective Date the Participant 
agrees to pay the Originator an amount equal to the Purchase Price for each 
such Participation purchased by the Participant hereunder.

ARTICLE VI.

CONFIDENTIALITY

          SECTION 6.01 General Duty. Each party hereto agrees that (i) each 
of the Transaction Documents and its contents, (ii) each Loan Documentation 
Package and its contents, (iii) all medical and personal information 
concerning the Underlying Lives and Premium Finance Borrowers, (iv) the 
identity of and information concerning payments to brokers or other similar 
parties involved in the sourcing, negotiation and funding of any Insurance 
Premium Loan, (v) any information supplied by either party and marked 
confidential, restricted or proprietary or that otherwise reasonably could 
be expected to be confidential in nature regarding its customers and 
prospective customers, account information, products and services, vendors, 
financial, technical or marketing information, business or marketing 
strategies, operating policies and procedures, in whatever form, in each 
case to the extent not in the public domain when transmitted by one party 
to another, not published or otherwise become part of the public domain 
(through no fault of the receiving party) after transmission, not known to 
the receiving party prior to transmission or through disclosure by a third 
party with a lawful right to make such disclosure (and not to the knowledge 
of the recipient of such information bound by any duty to the transmitting 
party to keep such information confidential) and not independently 
developed by the receiving party, comprise Confidential Information.

          SECTION 6.02 Reasonable Precautions. Each party hereto shall 
safeguard and hold as confidential all Confidential Information, and shall 
use such information solely for the purposes contemplated by the 
Transaction Documents, in each case other than its own Confidential 
Information to the extent appropriately disclosed to others in connection 
with its business unrelated to the transactions contemplated by the 
Transaction Documents. Each party hereto shall take such precautions as may 
be lawful and reasonably necessary to restrain its officers, directors, 
employees, agents or representatives from disclosure of all Confidential 
Information to any other Person other than to its own officers, directors, 
employees, agents or representatives that have a need to know such 
information in order for such party to perform its obligations under the 
Transaction Documents, other than its own Confidential Information to the 
extent appropriately disclosed to others in connection with its business 
unrelated to the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents. If 
any party reasonably and in good faith determines that it is required by 
law (or by subpoena, discovery request, search warrant or similar legal 
process) to disclose any Confidential Information to a third party (other 
than a regulator that regulates the Originator or any of its Affiliates), 
such party promptly shall notify the other of such situation or of its 
receipt of such legal process and shall reasonably cooperate with such 
other party in an effort to quash such legal process or to seek a 
protective order or other appropriate relief. Upon the termination or 
expiration of this Agreement, each party hereto promptly shall return to 
the other all Confidential Information of such other party that is within 
its custody and control. Each party hereto agrees that legal remedies may 
be insufficient for a breach of the duties specified in this Section 6.02, 
and that each party shall be entitled to injunctive relief to prevent 
disclosure of and cause the return of Confidential Information as 
contemplated herein, in addition to any other legal or equitable remedies 
available to such party.

          SECTION 6.03 Dissemination of Certain Information. Each party 
hereto shall at all times comply with all laws and regulations applicable 
to it in the performance of its duties hereunder and affecting the 
Insurance Premium Loans and related Collateral (including any Life

15

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

Insurance Policies) and the negotiation, documentation, funding and 
servicing thereof, including laws and regulations regarding the privacy of 
any Underlying Life or Premium Finance Borrower and the maintenance of all 
information obtained by the Originator and/or the Participant in the 
performance of their duties in accordance with applicable laws and 
regulations concerning the dissemination of such information; provided that 
any party may disclose such information to competent judicial or regulatory 
authorities in response to a written request therefrom for such information 
or as otherwise reasonably and in faith determined to be required by law; 
provided, however, that (i) no party shall disclose such information to 
such judicial or regulatory authorities before the date set forth in such 
request therefor and (ii) each party shall provide the other with prompt 
notice to the extent permitted by law or regulation of such request, in 
order to permit such other party, at its own expense, to seek judicial or 
other relief before such information is disclosed.

          SECTION 6.04 Monitoring. In recognition of the Originators 
responsibilities under the Gramm Leach Bliley Act, Section 501(b) (15 
U.S.C. 6801) and the Interagency Guidelines Establishing Standards for 
Safeguarding Customer Information (the Guidelines), the Participant 
represents and warrants that it maintains an information security program 
designed to: (i) ensure the security and confidentiality of customer 
information, (ii) protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the 
security or integrity of customer information, (iii) protect against 
unauthorized access to or use of customer information that could result in 
substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer of the Originator and 
(iv) ensure proper disposal of consumer and customer information as 
required by applicable law, in each case only with respect to customer 
information actually in the possession and control of the Participant 
received in connection with an Insurance Premium Loan. The Participant 
agrees promptly to notify the Originator of any security breaches that 
relate to Confidential Information supplied by the Originator.

               (b) any representation (other than any representation as to

pursuant to Section 5.03), warranty, certification or written statement 
made or deemed made by the Originator under or in connection with this 
Agreement or in any statement, record, certificate, financial statement or

ownership of the Originators right, title and interest in and to the

               (g) the Originator shall become required to register as an 
investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended; 
or

               (h) a Servicer Default shall have occurred; or

               (i) an Event of Default shall have occurred under the 
Financing Agreement;

then, if the event set forth in paragraph (d) above shall have occurred, an 
Event of Termination shall occur without any notice, demand, protest or 
other requirement of any kind immediately upon the occurrence of such 
event, and the Participant may, by notice to the Originator, declare that 
an Event of Termination shall occur as of the date set forth in such 
notice. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Termination, the Effective 
Period shall automatically terminate (any such termination of the Effective

shall have, in addition to the rights and remedies set forth above and any 
other rights and remedies under this Agreement, the following rights and 
remedies:
