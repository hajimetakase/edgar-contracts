rate applicable hereunder). If, on the Interest Determination Date, the

the Reference Banks to provide the Administrative Agent with their offered 
quotations for deposits in U.S. Dollars, for a period substantially equal 
to the applicable Interest Period and in an amount substantially equal to

London interbank market at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such 
Business Day. If at least two (2) such quotations are provided, the LIBO 
Rate shall be calculated using the average of such quotations, and divided

requirements, if any (including, without limitation, any marginal, 
emergency, supplemental, special or other reserves) applicable on the 
Interest Determination Date to any member bank of the United States Federal 
Reserve System in respect of Eurocurrency liabilities (as defined in

Administrative Agent is advised by the Reference Banks

shall forthwith give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Borrower and 
the Administrative Agent shall (as instructed by the Majority Lenders) 
negotiate in good faith to determine the LIBO Rate or a substitute rate. 
Pending such determination, the Interest Rate shall be computed on the 
basis of the LIBO Rate as determined for the immediately preceding Interest 
Period. If the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (as instructed by the 
Majority Lenders) reach agreement as to the determination of the LIBO Rate 
or a substitute rate within 10 Business Days after the giving of notice by 
the Administrative Agent, the Loans shall bear interest at an interest rate 
equal to the sum of the LIBO Rate or such substitute rate as agreed by the 
Borrower and the Administrative Agent (as instructed by the Majority 
Lenders) and the Applicable Margin, such interest rate to be calculated by 
the Administrative Agent (as instructed by the Majority Lenders). If the 
Borrower and the Administrative Agent (as instructed by the Majority 
Lenders) do not reach agreement within such period, the Loans shall bear 
interest at an interest rate equal to the sum of the Alternative Rate in 
effect from time to time and the Applicable Margin until such time as the 
LIBO Rate can be determined.
 
(e) Interest on the Loans based upon the LIBO Rate shall be computed on the 
basis of a year of 360 days and actual days elapsed (including the first 
day but excluding the last day) occurring in the relevant Interest Period.
 
Section 3.3 Optional Prepayments. The Borrower may prepay all or a portion 
of the Loans, at any time after the disbursement of the Loans, which 
prepayment shall in each case be made together with accrued and unpaid 
interest on the principal amount so prepaid and all other amounts then 
payable under this Agreement (including Section 4.4) but without premium or 
penalty (subject to Section 4.4); provided that: (a) the Borrower shall 
give the Administrative Agent notice of each such prepayment as provided in 
Section 3.7 (and, upon the date specified in any such notice, the amount to 
be prepaid shall become due and payable hereunder), (b) each such notice of 
prepayment shall specify the amount being prepaid, (c) the Borrower shall 
certify that it has received, for the benefit of all parties to this 
Agreement, any necessary Governmental Approvals required in connection with 
such prepayment and (d) each partial prepayment shall be in the aggregate 
amount of U.S.$10,000,000 or an integral multiple of U.S.$1,000,000 in 
excess thereof and shall be applied to prepay the remaining installments of 
the Loans in the inverse order of maturity; provided that if and to the 
extent that any such prepayment would cause the Maturity Date to be earlier 
than the date that is the seven (7) year anniversary of the Closing Date, 
such prepayment shall be applied pro rata to the remaining installments of 
the Loans. Amounts that are prepaid may not be reborrowed by the Borrower.
 
Section 3.4 Mandatory Prepayments.
 
(a) Within forty-five (45) days of the financial closing of any Equity 
Issuance other than a Restricted Payment Equity Issuance, the Borrower 
shall apply an amount equal to not less than the Applicable Equity Issuance 
Percentage of the Net Cash Proceeds of such Equity Issuance, at the 
Borrowers election, exercisable on or prior to the receipt of such Net 
Cash Proceeds, (i) to prepay the Loans and any MPP Debt (to the extent that 
the terms of such MPP Debt require such prepayment and, in any event, only 
on a Pro Rata Basis) and/or (ii) to pay (or reserve to pay in a Debt 
Service Reserve Account) scheduled debt service obligations of the Obligors 
under Other Bilateral Debt, Permitted Refinancing Debt or the Loans due 
within the
 
42
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
12-month period immediately following the date of the financial closing of 
such Equity Issuance; provided that, if and to the extent that the proceeds 
of any such Equity Issuance are to be used to fund Investment CAPEX or an 
Approved CAPEX Project, such proceeds shall be excluded in determining the 
amount of any mandatory prepayment required pursuant to this Section 
3.4(a).
 
(b) Within forty-five (45) days of the receipt by any Aracruz Party of Net 
Cash Proceeds from an Asset Sale (including receipt by any such Aracruz 
Party of proceeds from an Asset Sale involving the assets of Veracel), the 
Borrower shall apply the Net Cash Proceeds of such Asset Sale as follows:
 
   (i) 100% of the Net Cash Proceeds from an Asset Sale involving all or
   any portion of Collateral (which Asset Sale shall, for the avoidance of
   doubt, be carried out in accordance with Section 8.18) to prepay
   obligations under the Loans and, if and to the extent mutually agreed by
   the parties in an Intercreditor Agreement, any other Permitted
   Refinancing Debt that may be secured by the Collateral pursuant to the
   terms of such Intercreditor Agreement and in accordance therewith;
    
   (ii) 75% of the Net Cash Proceeds of any Asset Sale involving all or any
   portion of the Capital Stock directly or indirectly held by Aracruz
   Celulose in Portocel (which Asset Sale shall, for the avoidance of
   doubt, be carried out in accordance with Section 8.18) or in Veracel to
   prepay the Loans and any MPP Debt (to the extent that the terms of such
   MPP Debt require such prepayment and, in any event, only on a Pro Rata
   Basis); and
    
   (iii) 75% of the Net Cash Proceeds of any Asset Sale not referred to in
   clauses (i) or (ii) above to, at the Borrowers election exercisable on
   or prior to the time of the closing of such Asset Sale, to (A) prepay
   the Loans and any MPP Debt (to the extent that the terms of such MPP
   Debt require such prepayment and, in any event, only on a Pro Rata
   Basis) and/or (B) pay (or reserve to pay in a Debt Service Reserve
   Account) scheduled debt service obligations of the Obligors under Other
   Bilateral Debt, Permitted Refinancing Debt or the Loans due within the
   12-month period immediately following the date of the financial closing
   of such Asset Sale.
    
(c) Within forty-five (45) days of the receipt by any Aracruz Party of Net 
Cash Proceeds from a Casualty Event (including receipt by any such Aracruz 
Party of proceeds from an Asset Sale involving a Casualty Event of 
Veracel), the Borrower shall prepay an aggregate principal amount of the 
Loans in an amount equal to the amount of any such Net Cash Proceeds; 
provided, however, that, if and for so long as no Default or Event of 
Default is continuing hereunder and the Borrower has delivered a 
certificate to the Administrative Agent within fifteen Business Days of the 
occurrence of such Casualty Event stating that, within 180 days after the 
occurrence of such Casualty Event (or such other period set forth in such 
certificate if the Borrower reasonably determines that the Restoration of 
the affected Properties or assets cannot reasonably be concluded within 180 
days, provided that such certificate outlines in reasonable detail the 
projected steps for the completion of such Restoration) (the Relevant 
Reinvestment Period), all or a portion of such Net Cash Proceeds (but in 
no event more than U.S.$75 million without the consent of the Majority 
Lenders) shall be used to Restore any Properties or assets in respect of 
which such Net Cash Proceeds were paid (which
 
43
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
certificate shall set forth a detailed estimate of the Net Cash Proceeds to 
be so expended), all or such portion of such Net Cash Proceeds may be used 
to Restore any such affected Properties or assets during the Relevant 
Reinvestment Period; provided further, that if all or any portion of such 
Net Cash Proceeds is not ultimately required to be so applied within the 
Relevant Reinvestment Period pursuant to the preceding proviso, any 
remaining portion of such Net Cash Proceeds shall, within 10 days after the 
last day of the Relevant Reinvestment Period, be applied to prepay the 
Loans in an amount equal to the amount of such remaining portion of such 
Net Cash Proceeds.
 
(d) Within ten (10) days of the financial closing of the issuance or 
borrowing of Permitted Refinancing Debt (any such date, an Incurrence Date
):
 
   (i) if such Permitted Refinancing Debt is Subsequently Issued Pari Passu
   Refinancing Debt, the Borrower shall apply 100% of the Net Cash Proceeds
   of such Subsequently Issued Pari Passu Refinancing Debt to prepay the
   Loans; and
    
   (ii) if such Permitted Refinancing Debt is not Subsequently Issued Pari
   Passu Refinancing Debt, the Borrower shall, at the Borrowers option
   exercisable on or prior to the receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds, apply
   100% of the Net Cash Proceeds of such Permitted Refinancing Debt to (A)
   prepay the Loans and any MPP Debt (to the extent that the terms of such
   MPP Debt require such prepayment and, in any event, only on a Pro Rata
   Basis) and/or (B) pay (or reserve to pay in a Debt Service Reserve
   Account) scheduled debt service obligations of the Obligors under Other
   Bilateral Debt, Permitted Refinancing Debt or the Loans due within the
   12-month period immediately following such Incurrence Date.
    
(e) Within forty-five (45) days of any optional prepayment of Permitted 
Refinancing Debt the effect of which is to cause (taking into account such 
prepayment) the weighted average maturity of such Permitted Refinancing 
Debt to be less than the weighted average maturity of the Loans, in each 
case, as calculated on the Incurrence Date of such Permitted Refinancing 
Debt, the Borrower shall prepay the Loans in an amount equal to the portion 
of such optional prepayment that caused the weighted average maturity of 
such Permitted Refinancing Debt to be less than the weighted average 
maturity of outstanding obligations under the Loans.
 
(f) Within fifty (50) days of the date on which Aracruz Celulose has 
delivered its audited annual consolidated financial statements pursuant to 
Section 8.4 and in no event later than 140 days following the end of each 
Fiscal Year (such outside date, the Original Excess Cash Payment Date), 
the Borrower shall apply 75% of any Excess Cash attributable to such Fiscal 
Year to prepay the Loans; provided, however, that, if the making of such 
payment would cause the Aracruz Parties on a consolidated basis to have 
less than the Working Capital Cap in cash or Cash Equivalents as of the 
date of such payment, the Borrower may, by written notice to the 
Administrative Agent providing a certificate of the Chief Financial Officer 
of Aracruz Celulose to such effect, elect to defer such mandatory 
prepayment until the last day of the third Fiscal Quarter of the 
then-current Fiscal Year (the New Excess Cash Payment Date), in which 
case, on or prior to the New Excess Cash Payment Date, the Borrower shall 
apply 75% of any Excess Cash attributable to such immediately preceding 
Fiscal Year plus interest on 75% of such Excess Cash attributable to such 
immediately preceding Fiscal Year from the Original
 
44
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Excess Cash Payment Date to the New Excess Cash Payment Date (or, if 
earlier, the date on which the application of 75% of any Excess Cash 
attributable to the preceding Fiscal Year is made in full) at a per annum 
rate equal to the Default Rate (without duplication with the interest 
otherwise payable with respect to such Excess Cash) to prepay the Loans; 
provided that in no event shall the Borrower be entitled to exercise the 
election permitted in this clause (f) more than two (2) times prior to the 
Maturity Date.
 
(g) Upon receipt of a written request from the Administrative Agent (which 
shall be provided by the Administrative Agent to the Collateral Agents on a 
monthly basis or more frequently upon written request of the Majority 
Lenders to the Administrative Agent), the Collateral Agents (upon reliance 
on any certificates of the Chief Financial Officer of Aracruz Celulose 
delivered to any such Collateral Agent pursuant to Section 3.4(i)) shall 
inform the Administrative Agent in writing whether or not the funds 
deposited in any Debt Service Reserve Accounts have been used for the 
contemplated purpose during the contemplated period pursuant to any DSRA 
Application Notices delivered to the Collateral Agents pursuant to Section 
3.4(i), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly inform the Borrower and 
each Lender in writing of such Collateral Agents response. Immediately, 
and in no event later than eight (8) Business Days after receipt of a 
written notice from the Administrative Agent (as informed by the applicable 
Collateral Agent pursuant to the previous sentence) that funds reserved in 
a Debt Service Reserve Account have not been used for the contemplated 
purpose during the contemplated period pursuant to the terms of this 
Agreement, the Borrower shall prepay the Loans and any MPP Debt (to the 
extent that the terms of such MPP Debt require such prepayment and, in any 
event, only on a Pro Rata Basis) in an amount equal to the amount that was 
not used for the contemplated purpose as set forth in such notice.
 
(h) Any mandatory prepayment as provided for in this Section 3.4 shall be 
made together with accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount so 
prepaid and all other amounts then payable under this Agreement (including 
Section 4.4) but without premium or penalty (subject to Section 4.4) and 
shall be applied to prepay the remaining installments of the Loans in the 
inverse order of maturity; provided that if any such prepayment would cause 
the Maturity Date to be earlier than the date that is the seven (7) year 
anniversary of the Closing Date, such prepayment shall be applied pro rata 
to the remaining installments of the Loans. The Borrower shall give the 
Administrative Agent notice of the proposed date of each such mandatory 
prepayment provided for in this Section 3.4 as provided in Section 3.7 and, 
upon the date specified in any such notice, the amount to be prepaid shall 
become due and payable hereunder.
 
(i) If, pursuant to this Section 3.4, the Borrower elects to reserve in a 
Debt Service Reserve Account funds to (i) pay scheduled debt service 
obligations of the Obligors under Other Bilateral Debt, Permitted 
Refinancing Debt or the Loans or (ii) make mandatory prepayments hereunder 
pursuant to Section 3.4(k), in each case if and to the extent permitted by 
this Section 3.4, the Borrower shall (A) at the time of such election, 
specify the due date, principal amount or the amount of the mandatory 
prepayment to be made pursuant to Section 3.4(k), as the case may be, and 
creditor corresponding to each such debt service obligation in each case in 
writing to the Administrative Agent and Collateral Agents (each such 
written specification, a DSRA Application Notice) and (B) except as 
provided in clause (g) above, be entitled to withdraw such funds from the 
relevant Debt Service Reserve Accounts pursuant to the U.S. Account Control 
Agreement and Brazil Account Pledge Agreement only as necessary
 
45
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
to pay such specified debt service obligations or to make such mandatory 
prepayments on such specified due dates and at no other time and for no 
other purpose, it being understood and agreed that, to the extent any funds 
are reserved in a Debt Service Reserve Account to make scheduled debt 
service payments or mandatory prepayments under the Loans, such funds shall 
be reserved in a Debt Service Reserve Account in New York for such 
purposes. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, unless and until 
such funds are paid to such creditors, all funds in the Debt Service 
Reserve Accounts shall constitute part of the Collateral and no other 
Person other than the Collateral Agents (acting on behalf of the Lenders) 
shall have any right, title or interest in such account or the funds 
contained therein. The relevant Collateral Agent shall consent to any 
withdrawal from a Debt Service Reserve Account contemplated in this Section 
3.4(i) if and as requested in writing by the Borrower or any Debt Service 
Reserve Account intermediary, within two (2) Business Days of receipt of a 
certificate of the Chief Financial Officer of Aracruz Celulose that such 
withdrawal is to be carried out in compliance with this Section 3.4(i) as 
well as any additional documentation as such Collateral Agent requires for 
payments to third parties.
 
(j) If no Default or Event of Default exists and is continuing, then the 
relevant Collateral Agent shall, at the written direction of the Borrower 
from time to time (including by facsimile or electronic communication), 
cause the funds in any Debt Service Reserve Accounts to be invested or 
reinvested in one (1) or more Permitted Investments or, in the case of any 
Debt Service Reserve Account maintained in Brazil, Brazil Permitted 
Investments, in each case selected by the Borrower; provided that in no 
event shall either Collateral Agent: (i) have any responsibility whatsoever 
as to the validity or quality of any Permitted Investment, (ii) be liable 
for the selection of Permitted Investments or for investment losses 
incurred thereon or in respect of losses incurred as a result of the 
liquidation of any Permitted Investment before its stated maturity or the 
failure of the Borrower to provide timely written investment direction or 
(iii) have any obligation to invest or reinvest any such amounts in the 
absence of such investment direction.
 
(k) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event that the 
Borrower is required to make a mandatory prepayment on a date other than a 
Payment Date, then the Borrower may, upon notice to the Administrative 
Agent, elect to make such payment into a Debt Service Reserve Account 
maintained in New York, New York on or before the date such payment is due, 
and on the next Payment Date following such date, the Borrower shall apply 
the funds deposited in such Debt Service Reserve Account pursuant to this 
Section 3.4(k) to such mandatory prepayment.
 
Section 3.5 Payments. (a) All payments of principal, interest and other 
amounts to be made to the Lender Parties under this Agreement (including 
payments made pursuant to Section 5.6(b)) (other than payments made by 
Aracruz Celulose to the Affiliates of the Funding Lenders in respect of the 
Real-Denominated Obligations pursuant to Section 2.3(b)(ii), which shall be 
received in Reais) shall be received in U.S. Dollars, in immediately 
available funds, without deduction, set-off or counterclaim, in the Export 
Collateral Account not later than 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the 
date on which such payment shall become due (each such payment received 
after such time on such due date to be deemed to have been received on the 
next New York Business Day). Amounts that are repaid may not be reborrowed 
by the Borrower.
 
46
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
(b) The Borrower shall, subject to Section 3.6, at the time of making each 
payment under this Agreement and any other Loan Documents (including 
payments made pursuant to Section 5.6(b)) for the account of any Lender 
Party, specify to the Administrative Agent (who shall notify the intended 
recipient(s) thereof) the amounts payable under the Loan Documents to which 
such payment is to be applied, and if the Borrower fails so to specify, or 
if insufficient funds are provided for application of such payment, or if 
an Event of Default exists, then the Administrative Agent shall, as 
directed by the Majority Lenders, distribute such payment for application 
ratably among the Lenders (i) first, to pay indemnities, interest, fees and 
such other amounts due to such Lenders, and (ii) second, to pay principal 
then due to such Lenders under this Agreement.
 
(c) Each payment credited to the Export Collateral Account under this 
Agreement for the account of any recipient shall be paid by the U.S. 
Collateral Agent to the Administrative Agent in accordance with the terms 
of this Agreement or in accordance with written instructions of the 
Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent shall pay such amounts 
promptly to such recipient, in immediately available funds, for the account 
of such recipient (with respect to a Lender, for the account of its 
Applicable Lending Office).
 
(d) If the due date of any payment to any Lender Party under this Agreement 
or any other Loan Document would otherwise fall on a day that is not a 
Business Day, then (to the extent not otherwise provided for herein) such 
date shall be extended to the next Business Day and interest (if any is 
applicable to such payment) shall be payable for any amount so extended for 
the period of such extension.
 
Section 3.6 Pro Rata Treatment. Except to the extent otherwise provided 
herein, each payment or prepayment of principal of the Loans shall be made 
for the account of the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the respective 
unpaid principal amounts of the Loans then due and payable to them.
 
Section 3.7 Certain Notices. The Notice of Borrowing shall be effective 
only if received by the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. (New 
York City time) on the date three (3) Business Days before the Closing 
Date. The Administrative Agent shall promptly, but no later than three (3) 
Business Days before the Closing Date, notify the Lenders of the receipt of 
the Borrowing Notice. Each notice of optional or mandatory prepayment shall 
be effective only if received by the Administrative Agent not later than 
11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the date five (5) Business Days before 
the date of such prepayment. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and 
shall specify the prepayment date (which date shall be a New York Business 
Day). The Administrative Agent shall promptly, but no later than three (3) 
Business Days before the requested prepayment date, notify the Lenders of 
the contents of each such notice.
 
Section 3.8 Non-Receipt of Funds by the Administrative Agent. Unless the 
Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by any Lender or 
an Obligor (in each case, the Payor) before the date on which the Payor 
is to make a Loan or extend credit pursuant to Section 2.3 or to make 
payment to the Administrative Agent (in the case of a Lender) of the 
proceeds of the Loans to be borrowed from such Lender under this Agreement 
or (in the case of an Obligor) of a payment to the Administrative Agent for 
the account of one (1) or more of the Lenders hereunder (any such payment 
being herein called the Required Payment) that such Payor will not make 
its Required Payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the
 
47
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Payor is making its Required Payment available to the Administrative Agent 
and may, but shall not be required to, in reliance upon such assumption, 
make available to the Lenders or the Borrower, as the case may be, a 
corresponding amount. If such amount is so advanced by the Administrative 
Agent but not made available by the Payor to the Administrative Agent by 
the required time on such date, then the Payor shall pay to the 
Administrative Agent, on demand, such amount with interest thereon at a 
rate: (a) in the case of a Lender, equal to the rate specified by the 
Administrative Agent as its cost of funding of such amount for the 
applicable period, and (b) in the case of an Obligor, equal to the 
then-applicable Default Rate, in each case until such amount is paid in 
full (in immediately available U.S. Dollars) to the Administrative Agent; 
provided that the foregoing should not apply to an extension of credit by a 
Non-Funding Lender made pursuant to Section 2.3. A certificate of the 
Administrative Agent submitted to any Payor with respect to any amounts 
owing under this Section shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest 
error.
 
Section 3.9 Set-Off; Sharing of Payments. (a) Without limiting any of the 
obligations of the Obligors or the rights of any Lender Party under the 
Loan Documents, if the Borrower shall fail to pay when due (whether at 
stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) any amount payable by it 
hereunder or under any other Loan Document, then (to the extent not in 
violation of Applicable Law) each Lender Party may, without prior notice to 
the Obligors (which notice is expressly waived by it to the fullest extent 
permitted by Applicable Law), set-off and appropriate and apply against 
such amount any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, 
provisional or final, in any currency, matured or unmatured) at any time 
held or any other Debt owing by such Lender Party or any of its Affiliates 
(in each case, including any branch or agency thereof) to or for the credit 
or account of any Obligor. Each Lender Party shall promptly provide notice 
of any such set-off by it to such Obligor, as applicable, and the 
Administrative Agent; provided that failure by such Lender Party to provide 
such notice shall not in any way give such Obligor any cause of action or 
right to damages or affect the validity of such set-off and application.
 
(b) If any Lender Party shall obtain from any Obligor payment of any 
principal of or interest on the Loans, or payment of any other amount under 
this Agreement or the other Loan Documents through the exercise of any 
right of set-off, bankers lien, counterclaim or similar right or for any 
other reason (other than from the Agents as provided herein), and, as a 
result of such payment, such Lender Party shall have received a percentage 
of the principal of or interest on the Loans or such-other amounts then due 
under the Loan Documents in excess of such Lender Partys share thereof, 
then it shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent thereof and purchase 
from the applicable other Lender Parties participations in (or, if and to 
the extent specified by any such other Lender Party, direct interests in) 
the Loans or such other amounts, respectively, owing to such other Lender 
Parties (or in interest due thereon, as the case may be) in such amounts, 
and make such other adjustments from time to time, as shall be equitable, 
to the end that all the applicable Lender Parties shall share the benefit 
of such excess payment (net of any expenses that may be incurred by such 
Lender Party in obtaining or preserving such excess payment) pro rata in 
accordance with the unpaid principal of and/or interest on the Loans or 
such other amounts, respectively, owing to each of the Lender Parties under 
the Loan Documents. To such end, all such Lender Parties shall make 
appropriate adjustments among themselves (by the resale of participations 
sold or otherwise) if such payment is rescinded or must otherwise be 
restored.
 
48
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
(c) Nothing contained in this Section shall require any Lender Party to 
exercise any such right or shall affect the right of any Lender Party to 
exercise, and retain the benefits of exercising, any such right with 
respect to any other Debt or obligation of the Obligors.
 
ARTICLE IV
YIELD PROTECTION, ETC.
 
Section 4.1 Additional Costs. (a) If the adoption or effectiveness of any 
Applicable Law, or any change in any Applicable Law, or any change in the 
interpretation, administration or application thereof by any Governmental 
Authority charged with the interpretation, administration or application 
thereof, or compliance by any Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office) 
with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of 
any Governmental Authority (in each case above, at any time on or after the 
date hereof), shall impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve 
(including any such requirement imposed by the Board of Governors of the 
U.S. Federal Reserve System), special deposit, insurance assessment or 
similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, 
or credit extended by, any Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office) or 
shall impose upon any Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office) or the 
London interbank market any other condition affecting its obligation to 
make or maintain its Loan, and the result of any of the foregoing is to 
increase the cost to such Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office) of 
making or maintaining its Loan, or to reduce the amount of any sum received 
or receivable by such Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office) under this 
Agreement or under any other Loan Document (other than Taxes), then the 
Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such 
Lender such additional amount(s) as will compensate such Lender (or its 
Applicable Lending Office) for such increased cost or reduction.
 
(b) If any Lender shall have reasonably determined that the adoption or 
effectiveness of any Applicable Law regarding capital adequacy, or any 
change therein, or any change in the interpretation, administration or 
application thereof by any Governmental Authority charged with the 
interpretation, administration or application thereof, or compliance by it 
(or its Applicable Lending Office) with any request or directive regarding 
capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any 
Governmental Authority (in each case above, at any time on or after the 
date hereof), has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return 
on capital of such Lender (or its parent or Applicable Lending Office) as a 
consequence of such Lenders obligations hereunder or its Loan a level 
below that which such Lender (or its parent or Applicable Lending Office) 
could have achieved but for such adoption, change, request or directive, 
then upon written demand by such Lender, the Borrower, from time to time, 
shall pay to such Lender such additional amount as will compensate such 
Lender (or its parent or Applicable Lending Office, as the case may be) for 
such reduction.
 
(c) Each Lender shall promptly (and, in any event, within 180 days of its 
actual knowledge thereof) notify the Administrative Agent (with a copy to 
the Borrower) of any event of which it has knowledge that will entitle such 
Lender to compensation pursuant to this Section 4.1 and shall provide the 
Administrative Agent (with a copy to the Borrower) with reasonable detail 
as to the basis of such Lenders claim to compensation hereunder and method 
for calculating such compensation. Before giving any such notice, a Lender 
shall designate a different Applicable Lending Office if such designation: 
(i) will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation and 
(ii) will not, in the good faith judgment of such Lender,
 
49
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
be disadvantageous to such Lender. A notice of any Lender claiming 
compensation under this Section 4.1 and providing the information set forth 
above within the time set forth above shall be conclusive evidence of its 
entitlement to such compensation and shall be binding upon the Borrower in 
the absence of manifest error and such amounts shall be payable by the 
Borrower promptly (and, in any event, within five (5) Business Days) after 
receipt of such notice (or, if such compensation relates to future dates, 
by no later than the applicable dates indicated in such notice).
 
Section 4.2 Substitute Basis. If, on or before the first day of any 
Interest Period (an Affected Interest Period), the Majority Lenders 
determine and notify the Administrative Agent that the LIBO Rate for such 
Affected Interest Period will not be adequate to cover the cost to such 
Lenders of making or maintaining their Loans for such Affected Interest 
Period, then: (a) the Administrative Agent (as instructed by the Majority 
Lenders) and the Borrower shall negotiate in good faith to determine a 
mutually agreeable substitute rate of interest applicable to the affected 
Loans during the Affected Interest Period (it being understood that each 
affected Lender must consent to such substitute interest rate) and (b) if 
no agreement can be so reached by the tenth Business Day of the Affected 
Interest Period, then each affected Lender shall determine (and shall 
certify from time to time in a certificate delivered by such Lender to the 
Administrative Agent setting forth in reasonable detail the basis of the 
computation of such amount), which determination shall be made in a 
commercially reasonable manner, the substitute rate basis reflecting the 
cost to such Lender of funding its Loan for the Affected Interest Period, 
and such substitute rate basis (the Substitute Rate) shall be binding 
upon the Borrower and shall apply in lieu of the LIBO Rate for such 
Interest Period in the absence of manifest error and the Loans shall bear 
interest from the first day following the expiration of the negotiation 
period at the Substitute Rate plus the Applicable Margin.
 
Section 4.3 Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision of this 
Agreement, if the adoption or effectiveness of or any change in any 
Applicable Law or in the interpretation, administration or application 
thereof by any Governmental Authority (in each case, at any time on or 
after the date hereof) shall make it (or be asserted by it to be) unlawful 
for any Lender or its Applicable Lending Office to honor its obligation to 
make or maintain its Loan hereunder (and, in the reasonable opinion of such 
Lender, the designation of a different Applicable Lending Office would 
either not avoid such unlawfulness or would be disadvantageous to such 
Lender), then such Lender shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent 
(with a copy to the Borrower), following which notice: (a) such Lenders 
Commitment (if still available) shall be suspended until such time as such 
Lender may again make and maintain its Loan or (b) if such Applicable Law 
shall so mandate, such Lenders Loan shall be prepaid by the Borrower, 
together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon and all other amounts 
payable to such Lender by the Borrower under the Loan Documents, on or 
before such date as shall be mandated by such Applicable Law (such 
prepayment not being shared as described in Section 3.9(b) with any Lenders 
not so affected); provided that if it is lawful for such Lender to maintain 
its Loan until the next Payment Date, then such payment shall be made on 
such Payment Date. Any such funds so prepaid may not be reborrowed.
 
Section 4.4 Funding Losses. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative 
Agent for the account of each Lender, upon the request of such Lender 
through the Administrative Agent, such amount as shall be sufficient (in 
the reasonable opinion of such Lender) to compensate each Lender for any 
loss, cost or expense (excluding the loss of any anticipated profits, but 
including
 
50
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 

 
any such loss, cost or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment 
of funds obtained by such Lender to fund its Loan, or from fees payable to 
terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained or, in the case 
of any failure by the Borrower to borrow any Loan from any Funding Lender, 
any loss, cost or expense incurred by a Funding Lender as a result of the 
unwinding of any Foreign Exchange Contract entered into pursuant to Section 
2.3(b)) that such Lender determines is attributable to:
 
(a) any optional or mandatory prepayment (including as a result of an 
acceleration due to an Event of Default pursuant to Section 9.1) of the 
Loans made by the Borrower for any reason on a date other than a Payment 
Date occurring on a date that is not the last day of an Interest Period, or
 
(b) the failure by the Borrower to borrow any Loan from any Funding Lender 
or Non-Funding Lender for any reason (including the failure of any of the 
conditions precedent specified in Article VI to be satisfied) on the 
Closing Date, or
 
(c) any failure to prepay the Loans (or any portion thereof) in accordance 
with a notice of prepayment under Section 3.3 or Section 3.4, as 
applicable.
 
Each Lender shall furnish to the Administrative Agent (with a copy to the 
Borrower) a notice setting forth the basis and amount of each request by 
such Lender for compensation under this Section, which notice shall provide 
reasonable detail as to the calculation of such loss, cost or expense, and 
shall be conclusive evidence of its entitlement to such compensation and 
shall be binding upon the Borrower in the absence of manifest error and 
such amounts shall be payable by the Borrower promptly (and, in any event, 
within five (5) Business Days) after receipt of such notice (or, if such 
compensation relates to future dates, by no later than the applicable dates 
indicated in such notice).
 
Section 4.5 Taxes.
 
(a) Unless otherwise required by Applicable Law, all payments on account of 
the principal of and interest on the Loans, and fees and all other amounts 
payable under the Loan Documents by the Borrower or the Guarantors to or 
for the account of any Lender Party, including amounts payable under 
clauses (b) and (c), shall be made free and clear of and without reduction 
or liability for or on account of any Indemnified Taxes.
 
(b) The Borrower shall indemnify each Lender Party against, and reimburse 
each Lender Party on demand for, any Indemnified Taxes (including any 
Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable 
under this Section 4.5) paid by such Lender Party and any loss, liability, 
claim or expense, including interest, penalties and legal fees arising 
therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes 
were correctly or legally asserted; provided, however, that the Borrower 
shall not be required to indemnify any such amounts payable to any Lender 
Party to the extent attributable to such Lender Partys failure to comply 
with the requirements of clause (e) below. Such indemnification shall be 
made within 30 days after the date any Lender Party makes demand therefor.
 
(c) If any Person (including any Obligor) making a payment under the Loan 
Documents on behalf of any Obligor or any Agent shall be required by 
Applicable Law or otherwise to deduct or withhold any Taxes from any 
amounts payable to any Lender Party on,
 
51
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
under or in respect of the Loans or Loan Documents, then (i) such Person 
shall deduct or withhold and pay such Taxes in accordance with such 
Applicable Law or otherwise and (ii) if such Taxes are Indemnified Taxes, a 
relevant Obligor shall promptly pay the Administrative Agent (on behalf of 
the Lender Party entitled to such amount) such additional amounts as may be 
required, after the deduction or withholding of such Indemnified Taxes 
(including any Indemnified Taxes on any such additional amounts), to enable 
such Lender Party to receive on the due date therefor an amount equal to 
the full amount stated to be payable to such Lender Party under the Loan 
Documents; provided, however, that the Obligors shall not be required to 
increase any such amounts payable to any Lender Party to the extent 
attributable to such Lender Partys failure to comply with the requirements 
of clause (e) of this Section 4.5 below.
 
(d) Upon the payment of Indemnified Taxes to any Lender Party required 
under this Section 4.5, the Borrower shall furnish to the Administrative 
Agent, within 30 days after the date that such payment is made, the 
original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof or, if 
such original or copy of a receipt is not available from the relevant 
taxing authority, other documentation of payment reasonably satisfactory to 
such Lender Party.
 
(e) Each Lender Party that is entitled under Applicable Law to an exemption 
from or reduction of withholding tax with respect to any payments made by 
(or on behalf of) any Obligor pursuant to the Loan Documents agrees (or 
shall be deemed to have agreed) to comply with any certification, 
identification, information, documentation or other reporting requirement 
if: (i) such compliance is required by Applicable Law as a precondition to 
such exemption or reduction and (ii) at least thirty (30) days before the 
first date with respect to which such Obligor shall apply this paragraph 
with respect to such requirement, such Obligor shall have notified the 
relevant Lender Party that such Lender Party will be required to comply 
with such requirement; provided that compliance with any such requirement 
shall not apply to the extent that it would require disclosure by any 
Lender Party of information that such Lender Party in good faith considers 
to be confidential or otherwise materially disadvantageous to disclose, 
would expose such Lender Party to any unindemnified cost, risk or expense 
or be disadvantageous to it.
 
(f) Should a Lender Party become subject to Indemnified Taxes and not be 
entitled to receive additional amounts or to be indemnified because of its 
failure to comply with the requirements of paragraph (e) of this Section 
4.5, the Borrower shall take such steps as the Lender Party shall 
reasonably request at the expense of the Lender Party to assist the Lender 
Party to recover such Indemnified Taxes.
 
(g) If either Obligor reasonably determines that any Indemnified Taxes as 
to which it made a payment of additional amounts to a Lender Party pursuant 
to clause (c) were erroneously assessed, then such Obligor may notify such 
Lender Party of its determination thereof (along with a detailed 
description of the reason why such Obligor believes that such Indemnified 
Taxes were erroneously assessed) and request that such Lender Party refund 
to such Obligor the amount of such additional amounts. Upon its receipt of 
any such notice, and if such Lender Party determines (in good faith) that 
such Obligors determination with respect to such matter is correct, then 
such Lender Party shall (at the request and expense of such Obligor) 
reasonably cooperate with such Obligor in seeking a refund from the 
appropriate Governmental Authority of any such Indemnified Taxes 
erroneously assessed by, and paid to, such Governmental Authority.
 
52
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
(h) The Borrower agrees to pay all present and future stamp, court or 
documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar 
levies and any related interest or penalties incidental thereto imposed by 
any taxing authority that arise from any payment made by (or on behalf of) 
any Obligor under the Loan Documents, from the execution, delivery, 
enforcement or registration of the Loan Documents or from any filing, 
registration or recording contemplated by the Loan Documents, or otherwise 
in connection with the Loan Documents.
 
(i) If any Lender Party receives any refund which it determines in its 
reasonable discretion is attributable to Indemnified Taxes for which the 
Borrower has paid any additional amounts or indemnified amounts pursuant to 
this Section 4.5, then such Lender Party shall repay such refund with any 
interest received thereto, net of all out-of-pocket expenses of such Lender 
Party; provided, however, that the Borrower agrees to promptly return such 
refund or any portion thereof (plus penalties, interest or other charges) 
upon notice from such Lender Party that such refund or any portion thereof 
is required to be repaid to the relevant Governmental Authority. No Lender 
Party shall be obligated to disclose its tax return or any other 
information regarding its tax affairs or computations to the Borrower in 
connection with this clause (i) or any other provision of this Section 4.5.
 
ARTICLE V
COLLATERAL
 
Section 5.1 Collateral. The Obligations and the Guaranteed Obligations 
shall be secured by a perfected first-priority security interest in the 
Collateral.
 
Section 5.2 Release of Collateral. No Collateral other than the Aracruz 
Shares shall be released at any time (except as permitted pursuant to the 
Security Documents or Section 5.6) until all Obligations have been paid in 
full. The Aracruz Shares shall be released on the date on which all of the 
following conditions are first satisfied, as evidenced by a certificate of 
the Chief Financial Officer of Aracruz Celulose: (i) the Debt to Adjusted 
EBITDA Ratio as of the end of each of the then two (2) most recent Fiscal 
Quarters is less than 3.5:1.0, (ii) the Borrower has repaid at least 40% of 
the principal amount of Loans outstanding on the Closing Date and (iii) no 
Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; provided that 
in no event shall such date be earlier than three (3) years and six (6) 
months after the Closing Date.
 
Section 5.3 Application of Proceeds. The proceeds of any sale or 
disposition of all or any part of the Collateral pursuant to the Security 
Documents shall be applied as follows:
 
(a) First, to the reimbursement of sums expended by and fees owed to any 
Agent pursuant to the Security Documents and to the payment of the costs 
and expenses incurred by any Agent with respect to such sale or 
disposition, or any other enforcement action pursuant to the Security 
Documents, including any fees, attorneys fees, and all other expenses 
incurred in connection therewith;
 
(b) Second, to the Administrative Agent to be applied ratably to the 
payment in full of other Obligations; and
 
(c) Third, to, or at the written direction of, the pledgor or as a court of 
competent jurisdiction otherwise directs.
 
53
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Section 5.4 The Collateral Accounts. The Obligors shall, on or before the 
Closing Date, have caused the Collateral Agents to establish the Export 
Collateral Account and any Debt Service Reserve Accounts.
 
Section 5.5 Export Arrangements. (a) Not later than the third (3rd) 
Business Day of each Interest Period (or, in the case of the first Interest 
Period, not later than five (5) Business Days after the Closing Date) or at 
any time during each Interest Period as necessary to ensure that the 
Specified Coverage Ratio is satisfied throughout each Interest Period, the 
Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent (for distribution to the 
Lenders) a written list of all of the Receivables necessary to satisfy the 
Specified Coverage Ratio for such Interest Period, including, without 
limitation, the information with respect to such Receivables set forth in 
Schedule 1 to the U.S. Security Agreement, together with an acknowledgement 
that such Receivables are then promptly (and in no event later than five 
(5) Business Days thereafter) to be included on Schedule 1 to the U.S. 
Security Agreement. All of the Receivables so specified shall constitute 
Designated Receivables, and the delivery of such list to the Administrative 
Agent shall constitute a representation and warranty by the Borrower that, 
among other things, all such Designated Receivables are Eligible 
Receivables. Upon the written request of the Administrative Agent (as 
instructed by the Majority Lenders), the U.S. Collateral Agent or any 
Lender, the Borrower shall promptly deliver (i) copies of the Sales 
Agreements requested, if any, pertaining to such Designated Receivables, 
together with any agreements, documents and instruments executed, by the 
Borrower and the Eligible Offtaker party to any such Designated 
Receivables, (ii) a copy of a complete and correct set of documents of 
title requested (including, without limitation, bills of lading, commercial 
invoices and sight drafts) relating to the Products representing such 
Designated Receivables, including a Letter of Instruction executed by the 
Borrower pertaining to each such Receivable, and (iii) any other evidence 
they may reasonably request to demonstrate that such Receivables are 
Eligible Receivables.
 
(b) Aracruz Celulose shall at all times sell sufficient Products to the 
Borrower, and the Borrower shall at all times sell sufficient Products to 
Eligible Offtakers, so that there shall be Designated Receivables that are 
Eligible Receivables in sufficient quantities to satisfy the Specified 
Coverage Ratio throughout each Interest Period. No Receivable shall qualify 
as an Eligible Receivable for purposes of satisfying the Specified Coverage 
Ratio until the Borrower shall have delivered one (1) or more Letter(s) of 
Instructions to the Eligible Offtaker liable for payment of such 
Receivable.
 
(c) If any Event of Default exists, then the Administrative Agent (as 
instructed by the Majority Lenders) may, under the Export Finance 
Agreement, instruct Aracruz Celulose to promptly deliver Products to the 
Borrower, and may instruct the Borrower to promptly deliver Products, to 
the extent permitted by Applicable Law, to a buyer designated by the 
Administrative Agent (as instructed by the Majority Lenders) in exchange 
for such buyers deposit of the proceeds thereof, at market prices, into 
the Export Collateral Account for application in accordance with the terms 
hereof, until such time as such Event of Default shall no longer be 
continuing or all of the Loans and other amounts payable to the Lender 
Parties under the Loan Documents shall have been paid in full. Neither the 
Borrower nor Aracruz Celulose shall enter into any amendment or 
modification of, or grant any waiver under, the Export Finance Agreement, 
nor any other Export Arrangement to the extent (i) any such amendment, 
modification or waiver to such other Export Arrangement is adverse to any 
Lender Party or (ii) such Export Arrangement is then required to satisfy 
the Specified Coverage Ratio.
 
54
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
(d) With respect to each Designated Receivable, the Borrower shall deliver 
one (1) or more Letter(s) of Instructions to each Eligible Offtaker liable 
for payment of such Designated Receivable and shall use its commercially 
reasonable efforts to cause to be collected from each Eligible Offtaker, 
when due, for deposit in the Export Collateral Account, all amounts owing 
under such Designated Receivable. The Borrower hereby agrees that, with 
respect to any Letter of Instruction so delivered in connection with a 
Designated Receivable, it will not amend, modify, terminate or otherwise 
alter the instructions to make payment to the Export Collateral Account 
included in such Letter of Instruction without the prior written consent of 
the U.S. Collateral Agent. To the extent that the Borrower or any Agent (as 
instructed in writing by the Majority Lenders) or, in the case of any 
Collateral Agent, the Administrative Agent, shall at any time reasonably 
determine that delivery of a Letter of Instruction as set forth above is 
not sufficient to require the customers in any applicable jurisdiction to 
make payment of their Designated Receivables to the Export Collateral 
Account, any Agent (as instructed in writing by the Majority Lenders) or, 
in the case of any Collateral Agent, the Administrative Agent, may require 
that such customers acknowledge the Letters of Instruction or that other 
actions be taken to ensure that such customer(s) are so required and the 
collections on such Designated Receivables shall then not be considered 
Tested Collections nor shall such Designated Receivables be used to 
satisfy the Specified Coverage Ratio until the requesting Agent (as 
instructed in writing by the Majority Lenders) or, in the case of any 
Collateral Agent, the Administrative Agent, has confirmed to the Borrower 
(and the other Agents) that such requirement has been satisfied to its 
satisfaction. As of the date hereof, the Borrower hereby confirms that 
delivery of the Letters of Instruction pursuant to this Agreement alone is 
sufficient to create such a requirement pursuant to the Applicable Laws of 
the United States of America and Hungary.
 
(e) The Borrower and Aracruz Celulose shall ensure that each of the Sales 
Agreements and Export Arrangements to which it is a party and that is then 
being used to satisfy the Specified Coverage Ratio is in proper legal form 
under its governing law to ensure that it constitutes a legal, valid and 
binding obligation of each of the parties thereto under such law 
enforceable in accordance with its terms and there are no terms therein 
restricting or requiring the consent of the Eligible Offtaker to the 
assignment or transfer of, or the creation, attachment, perfection or 
enforcement of a security interest in the rights to payment thereunder. 
Each of the Borrower and Aracruz Celulose shall require that the purchase 
price of all Designated Receivables shall be payable solely in U.S. 
Dollars.
 
(f) If any funds are received by the Borrower or Aracruz Celulose from time 
to time in respect of Designated Receivables designated by the Borrower to 
satisfy the Specified Coverage Ratio, then the Borrower or Aracruz Celulose 
shall promptly (and, in any event, within four (4) Business Days) after its 
receipt thereof cause such funds or funds in an equal amount to be paid to 
the Export Collateral Account (and until so remitted, such funds shall be 
held in trust by such Person for the benefit of the U.S. Collateral Agent). 
The Borrower or Aracruz Celulose shall promptly (and, in any event, by no 
later than the third Business Day after any such remittance): (i) notify 
the Administrative Agent of each such remittance by it (or on its behalf) 
into the Export Collateral Account (specifying the amount and date thereof 
and the Designated Sales Agreement with respect to which it received such 
funds in respect of Designated Receivables) and (ii) deliver to the 
Administrative Agent evidence that it has sent a notice to the applicable 
customer that all future payments of Designated Receivables are to be 
deposited into the Export Collateral Account. Copies of the documents 
delivered to the
 
55
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Administrative Agent under clauses (i) and (ii) shall also be delivered to 
the U.S. Collateral Agent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall 
the operation of this clause (f) operate as a waiver of the obligation 
specified in Section 5.6(c).
 
(g) If the Majority Lenders at any time shall reasonably determine that the 
ability of any Eligible Offtaker listed on Schedule 2 to pay its Designated 
Receivables to the Export Collateral Account or any other Eligible Offtaker 
otherwise previously approved by the Majority Lenders has been materially 
adversely affected following the date of this Agreement or the date such 
Eligible Offtaker is included on Schedule 2 or approved by the Majority 
Lenders, as the case may be, then the Majority Lenders or any Agent (acting 
with Majority Lender consent) may deliver a notice of such determination to 
the Borrower. Upon receipt of such notice by the Borrower, such Eligible 
Offtaker shall no longer be deemed to be an Eligible Offtaker, unless the 
Designated Receivables of such Eligible Offtaker are otherwise covered by a 
Credit Insurance Policy or an Acceptable Letter of Credit or such Eligible 
Offtaker makes payment on a cash-against-documents or on a pre-shipment 
basis.
 
(h) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Borrower shall be 
permitted to deposit amounts in cash in the Export Collateral Account 
during any Interest Period.
 
(i) If no Default or Event of Default exists and is continuing, then the 
U.S. Collateral Agent shall, at the written direction of the Borrower from 
time to time (including by facsimile or electronic communication), cause 
the funds in the Export Collateral Account to be invested or reinvested in 
one (1) or more Permitted Investments selected by the Borrower; provided 
that in no event shall the U.S. Collateral Agent: (i) have any 
responsibility whatsoever as to the validity or quality of any Permitted 
Investment, (ii) be liable for the selection of Permitted Investments or 
for investment losses incurred thereon or in respect of losses incurred as 
a result of the liquidation of any Permitted Investment before its stated 
maturity or the failure of the Borrower to provide timely written 
investment direction or (iii) have any obligation to invest or reinvest any 
such amounts in the absence of such investment direction. It is 
acknowledged and agreed that the Borrower is permitted to instruct the U.S. 
Collateral Agent only to (x) invest in Permitted Investments as described 
in this Section 5.5(i) and only to (y) request, in writing only, the U.S. 
Collateral Agent to determine the balance in the Export Collateral Account 
pursuant to Section 5.6(a), and for no other purposes. Notwithstanding 
anything else in the Loan Documents to the contrary, in no event shall any 
such Permitted Investment (other than an investment in a mutual fund) 
mature later than the New York Business Day before the next Payment Date to 
the extent such funds are needed in order to make payments due on the next 
Payment Date (and investments in mutual funds shall, except to the extent 
that there is no need to use funds therein in order to make payments due on 
the next Payment Date pursuant to Section 5.6(a)(iii), be liquidated by the 
U.S. Collateral Agent on such previous New York Business Day); provided 
that any such investments made during the existence of a Default other than 
an Event of Default shall either mature by no later than the last day of 
the shortest cure period for all such existing Defaults or be Permitted 
Investments that are investments in mutual funds.
 
Section 5.6 Releases from the Export Collateral Account. Subject to the 
provisions of this Section 5.6, the U.S. Collateral Agent shall apply the 
collected credit balance of the Export Collateral Account in accordance 
with the written direction of the Administrative Agent.
 
56
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
(a) On the first Business Day of any Interest Period, and thereafter on a 
weekly basis, or at any other time upon the written request of the Borrower 
or the Administrative Agent on any Business Day on which the U.S. 
Collateral Agent is open, the U.S. Collateral Agent shall determine the 
balance in the Export Collateral Account (such sum, the Export Collateral 
Account Balance), and notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of 
such Export Collateral Account Balance, together with details of any 
deposits made since the date of the last such notice sent to the Borrower. 
If the Export Collateral Account Balance exceeds the Export Collateral 
Account Release Amount, and if no Default or Event of Default then exists 
or would result therefrom, then, upon written request of the Borrower, the 
Administrative Agent shall direct the U.S. Collateral Agent in writing to 
(by no later than two (2) Business Days following the receipt of such 
written request) instruct the Export Collateral Account intermediary to 
release from the Export Collateral Account and remit to the Borrower an 
amount not greater than the difference between the Export Collateral 
Account Balance and the Export Collateral Account Release Amount. 
Notwithstanding the above, the Administrative Agent may, upon written 
request of the Borrower, at any time during each Interest Period, notify 
the U.S. Collateral Agent to retain in the Export Collateral Account all or 
any portion of such amounts (all such amounts so retained being the 
Carry-over Amounts) for application to the payment of the Debt Service 
Amount for the next Payment Date.
 
(b) Without limiting the obligations of the Borrower hereunder and under 
the other Loan Documents, on each Payment Date (or earlier to the extent 
necessary to pay any portion of the Debt Service Amount payable before such 
Payment Date) the U.S. Collateral Agent is irrevocably authorized and 
directed to instruct the Export Collateral Account intermediary to debit 
the Export Collateral Account in accordance with the U.S. Account Control 
Agreement and deliver such funds to (or at the written instruction of) the 
Administrative Agent for application to the payment of the Debt Service 
Amount for such Payment Date (or such portion on such earlier date) 
pursuant to Section 3.5. All such amounts shall be applied by the 
Administrative Agent (in each case on a pro rata basis to the recipients 
thereof based upon the amounts then owed to them) in accordance with 
Section 5.3.
 
(c) If as of the close of the U.S. Collateral Agents business on the tenth 
(10th) Business Day before any Payment Date the Administrative Agent 
notifies the U.S. Collateral Agent that the credit balance of the Export 
Collateral Account is less than the Debt Service Amount for such Payment 
Date, then the U.S. Collateral Agent shall so notify the Obligors and the 
Obligors shall (by no later than the third (3rd) Business Day before such 
Payment Date) pay or cause to be paid to the Export Collateral Account an 
amount in U.S. Dollars in immediately available funds at least equal to 
such shortfall.
 
(d) At any time that a Default exists, the amounts credited to the Export 
Collateral Account shall not be released to the Borrower but shall be 
retained in the Export Collateral Account in each case for so long as any 
Default exists (or until applied in accordance with clause (b) above or 
Section 5.7), all upon the written instructions of the Administrative 
Agent.
 
Section 5.7 Remedies During Events of Default. While an Event of Default 
exists:
 
(a) upon written instructions from the Administrative Agent (acting at the 
direction of the Majority Lenders), the U.S. Collateral Agent shall apply 
or direct the application of any cash balance then on deposit in the Export 
Collateral Account, to the payment of any of the
 
57
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
obligations of the Obligors under the Loan Documents then due and unpaid 
(including any amounts accelerated pursuant to Section 9.1), all as set 
forth in the written instructions from the Administrative Agent (acting at 
the direction of the Majority Lenders) in accordance with Section 5.3, and
 
(b) the U.S. Collateral Agent shall, upon the written instructions of the 
Administrative Agent (acting at the direction of the Majority Lenders), 
liquidate any Permitted Investments made with funds from the Export 
Collateral Account and apply or cause to be applied the proceeds thereof in 
the manner described in clause (a) above.
 
Section 5.8 Certain Rights and Duties of the Collateral Agents. (a) Without 
prejudice to Section 5.6 and Section 5.8(b), the Collateral Agents shall 
take such steps as may be instructed in writing by the Administrative Agent 
(acting at the direction of the Majority Lenders) from time to time with 
respect to the Collateral; provided that neither Collateral Agent shall be 
required to take any action that it reasonably considers to be contrary to 
Applicable Law or the Loan Documents to which it is a party or that it 
believes would subject it to personal liability.
 
(b) Neither Collateral Agent shall be liable for any action taken or 
omitted by it with respect to the Collateral on the written instructions of 
the Administrative Agent, except if such action was taken or omitted as a 
result of such Collateral Agents own gross negligence or willful 
misconduct. The Collateral Agents shall follow the written requests, 
instructions and directions of the Administrative Agent or the Borrower, 
and shall disregard any request, instruction or direction from any other 
Person. In the event either Collateral Agent receives any request, 
instruction or direction from any Person other than the Administrative 
Agent which conflicts with a written request, instruction or direction from 
the Administrative Agent, such Collateral Agent shall proceed in accordance 
with the written request, instruction or direction from the Administrative 
Agent, and such Collateral Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility 
to ascertain whether any such instructions are consistent with this 
Agreement or the other Loan Documents. Each Collateral Agent may 
conclusively rely and shall be fully protected in acting or refraining from 
acting upon any document that it believes to be genuine and to have been 
signed or presented by or on behalf of the proper party. Without limiting 
any other provision of this Agreement, none of the Agents shall have any 
responsibility or liability with respect to the perfection or priority of 
any security interest created by this Agreement, the U.S. Security 
Agreement or any other Loan Document. None of the Agents makes any 
representation or warranty as to the value or condition of the Collateral, 
or any part thereof, as to the title of any Obligor or any other Person 
thereto or as to the validity, execution, enforceability, legality or 
sufficiency of this Agreement, or the other Loan Documents, and none of the 
Agents shall incur any liability or responsibility in respect of any such 
matters.

ARTICLE VII
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
 
In order to induce the Lenders to enter into this Agreement and make the 
Loans hereunder, each of the Obligors makes the following representations 
and warranties as set forth in relation to it, all of which shall survive 
the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Notes, to the Lender 
Parties on the Effective Date and on the Closing Date, provided that any 
representation or warranty that by its terms is made as of a specified date 
shall be required to be true and correct only as of such specified date:
 
Section 7.1 Existence, Power and Authority. Each of the Obligors: (i) is a 
corporation or a limited liability company, as the case may be, duly 
organized, validly existing and, to the extent applicable under the laws of 
its jurisdiction of organization, in good standing under the laws of such 
jurisdiction of organization, (ii) has all requisite corporate power, and 
has all material Governmental Approvals, necessary to own or lease its 
Properties and assets and carry on its business as now being or as proposed 
to be conducted and to do all things necessary or appropriate in respect of 
its business, except where failure to have such Governmental Approvals (in 
the aggregate) is not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect, 
(iii) is duly qualified and is authorized to do business and is in good 
standing in all jurisdictions in which the ownership, leasing or operation 
of its property or the nature of the business conducted by it makes such 
qualification necessary, except where failure to so qualify (in the 
aggregate) is not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect and 
(iv) has full power, authority and legal right to make, execute, deliver 
and perform its obligations under each of the Loan Documents, to which it 
is a party and has taken all corporate or other action necessary to 
authorize the making, execution, delivery and performance by it of each 
such Loan Document as has been executed and delivered as of each date this 
representation and warranty is made.
 
Section 7.2 Subsidiaries.
 
(a) Set forth on Part (a) of Schedule 12 hereto is a complete and accurate 
list of all Subsidiaries of each Obligor, showing as of the Effective Date 
(as to each Obligor and to each such Subsidiary) the jurisdiction of its 
incorporation, the number of shares, membership interests or partnership 
interests (as applicable) of each class of its Capital Stock authorized, 
and the number outstanding, on the date hereof and the percentage of each 
such class of its Capital Stock owned (directly or indirectly) by such 
Obligor and the number of shares covered by all outstanding options, 
warrants, rights of conversion or purchase and similar rights at the date 
hereof. All of the outstanding Capital Stock in each Obligors Subsidiaries 
have been validly issued, are fully paid and non-assessable and are owned 
by such Obligor or one or more of its Subsidiaries free and clear of all 
Liens, except those created hereunder or under the Security Documents.
 
(b) No Obligor has any Capital Stock of any other corporation or entity 
other than those specifically disclosed in Part (b) of Schedule 12.
 
(c) The ownership interest in each of the Subsidiaries of each Obligor 
represents a direct or indirect controlling interest by such Obligor for 
purposes of directing or causing the direction of the management and 
policies of such Subsidiary.
 
63
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
(d) Alicia has no Debt other than Debt arising under the Loan Documents.
 
(e) The aggregate revenues or assets of the direct or indirect Subsidiaries 
of Aracruz Celulose that are not Material Subsidiaries do not exceed any 
threshold under the definition of Material Subsidiary that, if exceeded, 
would render such Subsidiaries a Material Subsidiary if such Subsidiaries 
were treated as a single Subsidiary. Each of the Subsidiaries of Aracruz 
Celulose (other than Portocel), the absence of which would have a material 
adverse effect on the business of the Aracruz Parties taken as a whole, is 
an Initial Guarantor.
 
Section 7.3 Due Authorization, Etc. The execution, delivery and performance 
by each Obligor of the Loan Documents and Export Arrangements to which it 
is or is to be a party have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate 
action (including any necessary shareholder action), and do not: (i) 
contravene its Organizational Documents, (ii) violate any Applicable Law, 
judgment, award, injunction or similar legal restriction in effect or (iii) 
conflict with or result in the breach of, or constitute a default or 
require any payment to be made under, any contract, loan agreement, 
indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, lease or other instrument or other 
contractual restriction binding upon or affecting it, any of its 
Subsidiaries or controlling shareholders, or any of its or their respective 
Properties, or (except pursuant to the Loan Documents) result in the 
creation of any Lien on any of its or their Properties. No Obligor nor any 
of its Subsidiaries is in violation of any such Applicable Law, judgment, 
award, injunction (except to the extent that any such violation is not 
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect) or in breach of any 
such contract, loan agreement, indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, lease or 
other instrument. No provision of any Applicable Law imposes material 
adverse conditions upon the Loan Documents, the Export Arrangements or any 
of the Obligors obligations thereunder.
 
Section 7.4 No Additional Authorization Required. Except for: (a) those 
Brazilian Governmental Approvals and documents required to be obtained in

authorization from, notice to or registration with, the Central Bank that

64
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
BNDES Release, all Governmental Approvals and other actions by, and all 
notices to and filings and registrations with, any Governmental Authority, 
and all third-party approvals required for (x) the due execution, delivery 
and performance by each of the Obligors of the Loan Documents and the 
Export Arrangements to which it is a party, (y) the legality, validity or 
enforceability of the Loan Documents and the Export Arrangements and (z)

remedies in respect of the Collateral pursuant to the Security Documents, 
have been obtained and are in full force and effect and true copies thereof 
have been provided to the Administrative Agent.
 
Section 7.5 Legal Effect. This Agreement and each other Loan Document to 
which it is a party have been duly executed and delivered by each Obligor, 
and are legal, valid and binding obligations of such Obligor, enforceable 
against such Obligor, in accordance with their terms, in each case, except 
as such enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, 
reorganization, recuperação judicial, recuperação extrajudicial, falência 
or other similar laws relating to or affecting the enforcement of 
creditors rights generally and as may be limited by equitable principles 
of general applicability.
 
Section 7.6 Financial Statements.
 
(a) Each of Aracruz Celulose and the Borrower has furnished to the Lender 
Parties its audited consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2008, and 
the related statements of income, stockholders equity and changes in 
financial position for the fiscal year ending on that date, in each case 
reported on by Deloitte. Such financial statements are complete and correct 
and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of 
such Person and its consolidated Subsidiaries as at such date and their 
results of operations and changes in financial position for such periods, 
all in accordance with GAAP.
 
(b) None of Aracruz Celulose nor any of its consolidated Subsidiaries has 
any material contingent liabilities unusual forward or long-term 
commitments or unrealized losses, except as disclosed in the financial 
statements referred to in paragraph (a) above or the notes thereto; and
 
(c) Since December 31, 2008, no event or circumstance has occurred that has 
had, or could reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect.
 
Section 7.7 Ranking; Priority. The obligations of each Obligor under the 
Loan Documents and the Export Arrangements to which it is a party 
constitute, and will at all times constitute, direct and unconditional 
general obligations of such Obligor and rank and will at all times rank at 
least pari passu in right of payment with all other present and future 
unsubordinated Debt of such Obligor; it being understood that such other 
Debt (other than in the case of Alicia, which may not incur any Debt) may 
be secured by Liens as permitted by Section 8.6 (and, as such, may have a 
prior claim to the Properties subject to such Liens) but no other Debt or 
other obligations shall benefit from Liens on the Rights or, except as 
expressly permitted herein, the Collateral.
 
65
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Section 7.8 No Actions or Proceedings. There is no litigation, action, 
suit, investigation, claim, arbitration or other proceeding pending or, to 
the knowledge of each Obligor, threatened against such Obligor or any of

reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or (ii) purports 
to affect the legality, validity, binding effect or enforceability of any 
of the Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby.
 
Section 7.9 Commercial Activity; Absence of Immunity. Each of the Obligors 
is subject to civil and commercial law with respect to its obligations 
under the Loan Documents to which it is a party, and the making and 
performance by it of such Loan Documents constitute private and commercial 
acts rather than public or governmental acts. None of the Obligors nor any 
of their respective Properties is entitled to immunity on the grounds of 
sovereignty or otherwise from the jurisdiction of any court or from any 
action, suit, set-off or proceeding, or service of process (whether through 
service or notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of 
execution, execution or otherwise) in connection therewith, arising under 
the Loan Documents.

and has paid all Taxes shown to be due thereon and payable except such as 
are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings or would not 
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
 
Section 7.12 Legal Form. (a) Each of the Loan Documents is (or upon its 
coming into existence will be) in proper legal form under its governing law 
for the enforcement thereof in accordance with their respective terms 
against the Obligors thereto; provided that, for the admissibility in 
evidence of any Loan Document before Brazilian courts: (i) the signatures 
of the parties signing such document outside Brazil must be notarized by a 
notary public qualified as such under the laws of the place of signing and 
the signature of such notary public must be authenticated by a Brazilian 
consular officer at the competent Brazilian consulate; and (ii) each of the 
Loan Documents executed in English must be translated into Portuguese by a 
sworn translator and filed with the competent Brazilian Registry of Deeds 
and Documents; provided further that, for the admissibility in evidence of 
any Loan Document before Hungarian courts: (x) the signatures of the 
parties signing such document outside Hungary must be notarized by a notary 
public qualified as such under the laws of the place of signing and the 
signature of such
 
66
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
notary public must be authenticated by a Hungarian consular officer at the 
competent Hungarian consulate; and (y) such document must be translated 
into Hungarian by a sworn translator. Subject to the preceding sentence, 
all formalities required in Hungary and/or Brazil for the validity and 
enforceability (including any necessary registration, recording or filing 
with any court or other Governmental Authority) of each Loan Document have 
been accomplished, and no Taxes are required to be paid for the validity 
and enforceability thereof except, in the case of enforcing any Loan 
Document in Brazil or Hungary, as the case may be, the litigating party 
(plaintiff) will have to post security or a performance bond to secure the 
costs of the proceeding and the fees of the opposite partys (defendant) 
lawyer as required by Article 835 of the Brazilian Civil Procedure Code or 
as required by Articles 89-92 of the Hungarian Civil Procedure Code, as the 
case may be.
 
(b) It is not necessary in order for any Lender Party to enforce any rights 
or remedies under the Loan Documents or solely by reason of the execution, 
delivery and performance by the Obligors of the Loan Documents, that any 
Lender Party be licensed or qualified with any Brazilian or Hungarian 
Governmental Authority or be entitled to carry on business in any 
jurisdiction.
 
(c) Any certificate signed by any officer of any Obligor and delivered to 
the Administrative Agent (or its counsel) in connection with the Loans and 
this Agreement shall be deemed a representation and warranty by such 
Obligor, as to matters covered thereby, to each Lender Party.
 
Section 7.13 Full Disclosure. The information, reports, financial 
statements, certificates, exhibits and schedules furnished from time to 
time in writing by (or on behalf of) any Obligor to any Agent or any Lender 
in connection with the Loan Documents or delivered hereunder or pursuant 
thereto do not and will not contain any material misstatement of fact or, 
taken as a whole, omit to state any material fact necessary to make the 
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were 
made, not misleading on the date as of which such information is stated or 
certified, provided that, with respect to any projected financial 
information or appraisals that were prepared by or on behalf of any Aracruz 
Party in connection with the transactions contemplated herein and delivered 
by an Aracruz Party to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders prior to 
the Closing Date (Projections), each Obligor represents only that such 
Projections were prepared in good faith based on assumptions believed to be 
reasonable at the time of their preparation. There are no facts or 
circumstances known to each of the Obligors that, individually or in the 
aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect 
and that have not been disclosed to the Lender Parties.
 
Section 7.14 Security Interest. The Loan Documents provide, and will 
provide so long as any Loan is outstanding, the U.S. Collateral Agent (on 
behalf of the Lender Parties) with effective, valid, legally binding and 
enforceable first priority Liens on all of the Collateral (as defined in 
the U.S. Security Agreement) to which Article 9 of the UCC is applicable 
under the laws of the United States as security for the payment and 
performance of the Obligations and Guaranteed Obligations. No action must 
be taken in Hungary to ensure that the Liens on all of the Collateral (to 
the extent set forth in the immediately preceding sentence) are effective, 
valid, legally binding and enforceable under Hungarian law other than 
reporting the existence of the Collateral to the Hungarian liquidator in 
case of any Obligors liquidation. The U.S. Collateral Agents security 
interests described above will be, as of the Closing Date (and, with 
respect to all
 
67
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
subsequently acquired Collateral, will be when so acquired) superior and 
prior to the rights of all third Persons now existing or hereafter arising 
whether by way of Lien, assignment or otherwise. Upon the filing of the 
Barra do Riacho Security Documents, each Brazilian Security Document, the 
consummation of the BNDES Release and the recordation of the pledges 
created under the Aracruz Share Pledge Agreement and the Alicia Share 
Pledge Agreement in the relevant Share Registry Book, all necessary action 
will have been taken as of the Closing Date under the applicable laws of 
Brazil to establish and perfect the Brazil Collateral Agents first 
priority rights in all collateral pledged thereunder.
 
Section 7.15 Title to Assets; Liens. Except for Permitted Liens and other 
Liens permitted pursuant to Section 8.7, each of the Obligors: (x) has good 
and marketable title to, or lawfully possesses a valid and subsisting 
leasehold estate in, all Property or assets material to its business 
(including good and marketable title to: (i) with respect to the Borrower, 
all of the Rights pledged by it under the Loan Documents, (ii) with respect 
to Alicia, the Barra do Riacho Plants; (iii) with respect to Aracruz 
Celulose, the Associated Property, and (iv) with respect to the Borrower, 
before its sale thereof, all Products (and related Receivables) that become 
a part of the Rights) purported to be owned by it, free and clear of all 
Liens, and holds such title and all of such Property or asset in its own 
name and not in the name of any nominee or other Person and (y) except 
pursuant to the Loan Documents, is not restricted by its Organizational 
Documents, contract, Applicable Law or otherwise from creating Liens on any 
of the Rights pledged by it under the Loan Documents. Each Aracruz Party 
has insured the Properties (including the Barra do Riacho Collateral) used 
or useful in its business in such amounts and covering such risks and 
liabilities as are customary for companies of a similar size engaged in 
similar businesses in similar locations.
 
Section 7.16 Intellectual Property. Each Aracruz Party owns, or is licensed 
to use, all material trademarks, trade names, copyrights, patents, patents 
applications and other intellectual property necessary for the conduct of 
its business as presently conducted, and the use thereof by any Aracruz 
Party does not infringe upon the rights of any other Person, except for 
infringements that, in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to 
result in a Material Adverse Effect.
 
Section 7.17 Customers; Eligible Offtakers.

permitted herein.

(d) Neither Aracruz Celulose nor Alicia shall, without the consent of the 
Majority Lenders, on or after the Closing Date, terminate, amend, modify or 
change in any manner any material term or condition of the Alicia Lease.

not cause or permit any other Aracruz Party to, create, assume or suffer to 
exist any Lien on (a) any Collateral (other than (i) to secure Permitted 
Refinancing Debt to the extent expressly permitted hereunder and (ii) Liens 
in favor of BNDES on the Barra do Riacho Plants, which shall be released 
prior to the Closing Date) or (b) any Capital Stock of Veracel or any 
Material Subsidiary (other than the Capital Stock of a Refinancing 
Drop-Down Subsidiary that is or becomes a Material Subsidiary to the extent 
securing Permitted Refinancing Debt if and to the extent expressly 
permitted hereunder). In addition, no Obligor shall, and Aracruz Celulose 
shall not cause or permit any other Aracruz Party to, create, assume or 
suffer to exist any Lien on any other asset or Property of the Aracruz 
Parties, whether now owned or hereafter acquired by it, except Permitted 
Liens and Liens created under the Loan Documents.
 
Section 8.8 Transactions With Affiliates. No Obligor shall, and Aracruz 
Celulose shall not cause or permit any other Aracruz Party to, enter into 
any transaction of any kind with any Affiliate of such Obligor or of such 
other Aracruz Party, as the case may be, whether or not in the ordinary 
course of business, other than on fair and commercially reasonable terms 
substantially as favorable to such Obligor or such other Aracruz Party as 
would be obtainable by such Obligor or such other Aracruz Party at the time 
in a comparable arms length transaction with a Person other than an 
Affiliate of such Person, provided that the foregoing restriction shall not 
apply to transactions between or among any of Aracruz Celulose and any 
Wholly Owned Obligor; provided further that nothing in this Section 8.8 
shall be deemed to prohibit purchases and resales of Products in accordance 
with the Export Arrangements and similar transactions with the Aracruz 
Parties involving prepayments for exports from Brazil.
 
Section 8.9 Line of Business, Etc. None of the Obligors shall, and Aracruz 
Celulose shall cause each of its other Material Subsidiaries not to: (a) 
make any material change in its line of business, (b) change its fiscal 
year, (c) change its name or domicile or take any other action that might

Papel S.A. of control of Aracruz Celulose.
 
Section 8.10 Use of Proceeds. The Borrower shall use the proceeds of the 
Loan made by each Funding Lender solely to refinance the Terminated 
Derivative Obligations of each such Funding Lender. No part of the proceeds 
of the Loans shall be used directly or indirectly for the purpose (whether 
immediate, incidental or ultimate) of buying or carrying any Margin Stock. 
Each Obligor, each a nonbank entity located outside the United States, 
understands that it is the
 
76
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
policy of the Board of Governors of the U.S. Federal Reserve System that 
extensions of credit by international bank facilities (as defined in 
Section 204.8(a) of Regulation D) may be used only to finance the non-U.S. 
operations of a customer (or its foreign affiliates) located outside the 
United States as provided in Section 204.8(a) (3)(vi) of Regulation D. 
Therefore, each Obligor acknowledges that the proceeds of the Loans by the 
respective international banking facilities of the Lenders will be used 
solely to finance the Obligors operations outside the United States or 
that of the Obligors Affiliates that are domiciled outside the United 
States.
 
Section 8.11 Further Assurances. Each of the Obligors shall do and perform, 
from time to time, any and all acts (and execute any and all documents) as 
may be necessary or as reasonably requested by any Agent in order to effect 
the purposes of the Loan Documents and Export Arrangements. Without 
limiting the above, each of the Obligors shall, at its own cost, take all 
actions necessary or reasonably requested by any Agent to maintain each 
Lien created by the Loan Documents in full force and effect and enforceable 
in accordance with its terms, including: (a) making filings and 
recordations, (b) making payments of fees and other charges, (c) issuing 
and, if necessary, filing or recording supplemental documentation, 
including continuation statements, (d) discharging all claims or other 
Liens affecting any Rights, (e) publishing or otherwise delivering notice 
to third parties, (f) depositing title documents and (g) taking all other 
actions either necessary or otherwise reasonably requested by any Agent to

   the date that is ninety (90) days following the Closing Date.
 
87
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
If an Event of Default exists, then the Administrative Agent shall, upon

outstanding of, and the accrued interest on, the Loans and the Notes and 
all other amounts payable by the Obligors under the Loan Documents 
(including any amounts payable under Section 4.4) to be immediately due and 
payable, whereupon such amounts shall be immediately due and payable 
without presentment, demand, protest or other formalities of any kind, all 
of which are hereby expressly waived by the Obligors; provided that in the 
case of an Event of Default of the kind referred to in clause (e), (f) or

remedies under the Loan Documents and under Applicable Law and in equity 
available to the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agents and the 
Lenders or take any actions with respect to the exercise of such remedies.
 
ARTICLE X
THE AGENTS
 
Section 10.1         Appointment, Powers and Immunities. (a) Each Lender 
hereby appoints and authorizes each of the Agents to act as its agent 
hereunder and (as applicable) under the other Loan Documents to which such 
Agent is a party with such powers as are specifically delegated to such 
Agent by the terms of this Agreement and (as applicable) the other Loan 
Documents to which such Agent is a party and no implied duties or 
responsibilities shall be read into this Agreement against the Agents, 
together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Each 
Agent (which term as used in this sentence and in Section 10.5 shall 
include reference to its Affiliates and its own and its Affiliates 
officers, directors, employees, representatives and agents):
 
   (i)               shall have no duties or responsibilities except those
   expressly set forth in the Loan Documents to which such Agent is a party
   and shall not by reason of this Agreement or any other Loan Document be
   a trustee or fiduciary for any Lender Party,
    
   (ii)              shall not be responsible to the Lender Parties for any
   recitals, statements, representations or warranties contained in any
   Loan Document, or in any certificate or other document referred to or
   provided for in, or received by any of them under, any Loan Document, or
   for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or
   sufficiency of the Rights or any Loan Document or any other document
   referred to or provided for herein or for any failure by any Obligor to
   perform any of its obligations hereunder or thereunder,
    
   (iii)             shall not be required to initiate or conduct any
   litigation or collection proceedings under any Loan Document,
    
   (iv)             shall not be responsible for any action taken or
   omitted to be taken by it hereunder or under any other document referred
   to or provided for herein or in connection herewith, except for its own
   gross negligence or willful misconduct,
 
88
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
   (v)              shall not be bound to make any investigation into the
   facts or matters stated in any certificate, statement, instrument,
   opinion, report, notice, request, direction, consent, order or other
   paper or document,
    
   (vi)             shall not be responsible or liable for special,
   indirect, punitive or consequential loss or damage of any kind
   whatsoever (including, but not limited to, loss of profit) irrespective
   of whether such Agent has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or
   damage and regardless of the form of action, and
    
   (vii)            in no event shall any Agent be responsible or liable
   for any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations hereunder
   arising out of or caused by, directly or indirectly, forces beyond its
   control, including, without limitation strikes, work stoppages,
   accidents, acts of war or terrorism, civil or military disturbances,
   nuclear or natural catastrophes or acts of God, and interruptions, loss
   or malfunctions of utilities, communications or computer (software and
   hardware) services; it being understood that each Agent shall use
   reasonable efforts which are consistent with accepted practices in the
   banking industry to resume performance as soon as practicable under the
   circumstances.
    
Each Agent may employ agents and attorneys-in-fact and shall not be 
responsible for the negligence or misconduct of or for the supervision of 
any such agents or attorneys-in-fact that were selected by it in good 
faith. Each Agent shall as soon as practicable provide the Lenders with all 
information and copies of all notices which are given to it and which by 
the terms of this Agreement are to be provided or given to the Lenders.
 
(b) Before any Agent acts or refrains from acting, it may require an 
officers certificate from any Obligor and/or an opinion of counsel 
satisfactory to such Agent with respect to the proposed action or inaction. 
No Agent shall be liable for any action it takes or omits to take in good 
faith in reliance upon such certificate or opinion. Whenever in the 
administration of the Loan Documents to which such Agent is a party, such 
Agent shall deem it necessary or desirable that a matter be provided or 
established before taking or suffering or omitting to take any act under 
any Loan Document to which such Agent is a party, such matter (unless other 
evidence in respect thereof is herein specifically prescribed) may, in the 
absence of gross negligence or bad faith on the part of such Agent, be 
deemed to be conclusively proved and established by an officers 
certificate delivered to such Agent, and such certificate, in the absence 
of gross negligence or bad faith on the part of such Agent, shall be full 
warrant to such Agent for any action taken, suffered or omitted to be taken 
by it under the Loan Documents upon the faith thereof.
 
(c) Any Person: (i) into which any Agent may be merged or consolidated or 
(ii) that may result from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which 
any Agent shall be a party shall (if such Agent is not the surviving 
entity) be the successor of such Agent without the execution or filing of 
any instrument or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto.
 
Section 10.2 Reliance by the Agents. Each Agent shall be entitled to rely 
conclusively upon any certification, notice or other communication 
(including any thereof by facsimile) reasonably believed by it to be 
genuine and correct and to have been signed or sent by or on behalf of the 
appropriate Person(s), and upon advice and statements of legal counsel and 
other
 
89
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 

 
experts selected by such Agent. As to any matters not expressly provided 
for in the Loan Documents, the Collateral Agents shall be fully protected 
in relying upon the Administrative Agents written instruction and the 
Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in 
refraining from acting, thereunder in accordance with written instructions 
given by the Majority Lenders, and such written instructions of the 
Majority Lenders and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto 
shall be binding upon all of the Lender Parties.
 
Section 10.3 Defaults. No Agent shall be deemed to have knowledge or notice 
of the occurrence of a Default unless it has received written notice from a 
Lender or an Obligor specifying such Default and stating that such notice 
is a Notice of Default. If any Agent receives such a notice, then it 
shall give prompt notice thereof to the Lenders, the Borrower (if such 
notice is received from a Lender) and the other Agents. Any determination 
of the existence of a Default or Event of Default shall be made solely by 
the Majority Lenders. The Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agents 
shall (subject to Section 10.7) take such action with respect to any such 
Default as shall be directed by the Majority Lenders and the Administrative 
Agent, respectively; provided that unless and until any Agent shall have 
received such directions, it may (but shall not be obligated to) take such 
action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default 
(i) in the case of the Administrative Agent, as it shall deem advisable in 
the best interest of the Lender Parties except to the extent that the Loan 
Documents expressly require that such action be taken, or not be taken, 
only with the consent or upon the authorization of the Majority Lenders or 
all of the Lenders and (ii) in the case of the Collateral Agents, as 
directed by the Administrative Agent in writing.
 
Section 10.4 Rights as a Lender. With respect to any Commitment and Loan 
made or any Note held by it, Deutsche Bank AG (and any successor or 
Affiliate acting as an Agent) in its capacity as a Lender hereunder shall 
have the same rights and powers as any other Lender and may exercise the 
same as though its Affiliate, Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (or any 
successor acting as Agent) were not acting as an Agent, and the term 
Lender shall, unless the context otherwise indicates, include Deutsche 
Bank AG in its individual capacity. Deutsche Bank AG and its Affiliates may 
(without having to account therefor to any Lender) accept deposits from, 
lend money to, make investments in and generally engage in any kind of 
banking, trust or other business with any Obligor, any Eligible Offtaker, 
any Eligible Financial Institution and any Affiliate of any thereof as if 
its Affiliate were not acting as an Agent, and Deutsche Bank AG (and any 
such successor) and its Affiliates may accept fees and other consideration 
from any such Person(s) for services in connection with this Agreement or 
otherwise without having to account for the same to the Lenders.
 
Section 10.5 Indemnification. The Lenders agree to indemnify each Agent (to 
the extent not reimbursed under Section 12.4, but without limiting the 
obligations of the Obligors under Section 12.4) ratably in accordance with 
the aggregate principal amount of the Loans held by the Lenders (or, if no 
Loans are at the time outstanding, ratably in accordance with their 
respective Commitments) (in each case determined at the time such indemnity 
is sought), for any and all losses, liabilities, claims, obligations, 
damages or expenses (including the fees and disbursements of counsel) 
incurred by it arising out of or by reason of any investigation, 
litigation, arbitration or other proceeding (including any threatened 
investigation, arbitration or other proceeding) in any way relating to or 
arising out of this Agreement or any other Loan Documents to which such 
Agent is a party or the transactions contemplated hereby (including the 
costs and expenses that the Obligors are obligated to pay under Section 
12.4) or the enforcement
 
90
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
of any of the terms hereof or of any such other documents; provided that no 
Lender shall be liable to any Agent for any of the foregoing to the extent 
that it arises from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such 
Agent as determined by a final, nonappealable judgment by a court of 
competent jurisdiction. In no event shall any Lender be liable to any Agent 
or the Lender for any punitive or consequential damages in connection with 
any of the Loan Documents. The obligations of the Lenders under this 
Section 10.5 shall survive the termination of this Agreement, the repayment 
of the Loans and/or the earlier resignation or removal of an Agent.
 
Section 10.6 Non-Reliance upon the Agents and Other Lenders. Each Lender 
agrees that it has, independently and without reliance upon any Agent or 
any other Lender, and based upon such documents and information as it has 
deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis of the Obligors and 
decision to become a Lender and that it will, independently and without 
reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender, and based upon such documents 
and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make 
its own analysis and decisions in taking or not taking action under this 
Agreement and the other Loan Documents. No Agent shall be required to keep 
itself informed as to the performance or observance by any Obligor of this 
Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other document referred to or 
provided for herein or to inspect the Properties or books of any Obligor. 
Except for notices, reports and other documents and information expressly 
required to be furnished to the Lenders by any Agent under the Loan 
Documents to which such Agent is a party, such Agent shall have no duty or 
responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information 
concerning the affairs, financial condition or business of any Obligor that 
may come into the possession of such Agent or any of its Affiliates.
 
Section 10.7 Failure to Act. Except for any action expressly required of an 
Agent under a Loan Document to which such Agent is a party, it shall in all 
cases be fully justified in failing or refusing to act under the Loan 
Documents unless it shall receive further assurances to its satisfaction 
from the Lenders of their indemnification obligations under Section 10.5 
against any and all liability and expense that may be incurred by it by 
reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. No provision of any 
Loan Document shall require any Agent to take any action that it reasonably 
believes to be contrary to Applicable Law or any Loan Document to which it 
is a party or to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur financial 
liability in the performance of any of its duties thereunder or in the 
exercise of any of its rights or powers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, 
neither of the Collateral Agents shall be obligated to exercise discretion 
hereunder but shall at all times follow the written instructions of the 
Administrative Agent or the Borrower, as the case may be.
 
Section 10.8 Resignation or Removal of the Agents. Subject to the 
appointment and acceptance of a successor Agent as provided below, each 
Agent may, upon thirty (30) days prior notice, resign at any time by 
giving notice thereof to the Lenders and the Obligors, and each Agent may, 
upon thirty (30) days prior notice, be removed at any time with or without 
cause by the Majority Lenders. Upon any such resignation or removal, the 
Required Lenders (if no Default or Event of Default then exists, with the 
written consent of the Borrower, which consent shall not be unreasonably 
withheld or delayed) shall have the right to appoint a successor 
Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as the case may be. If no 
successor Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as the case may be, 
shall have been so appointed and shall have accepted such appointment 
within thirty (30) days after the relevant existing Agents giving of 
notice of resignation or the Majority Lenders election to remove such 
existing Agent, then such
 
91
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
existing Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Agent, 
which shall be a bank that has a combined capital and surplus of at least 
U.S.$500,000,000 (or its equivalent), or petition any court of competent 
jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Agent. Upon the acceptance 
of any appointment as the Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as the 
case may be, hereunder by a successor, such successor shall thereupon 
succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and 
duties of such existing Agent, and such existing Agent shall be discharged 
from its duties and obligations hereunder: After any Agents resignation or 
removal hereunder, the provisions of this Article shall continue in effect 
for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by 
it while it was acting as Agent.
 
Section 10.9 Limitation on Duty of Collateral Agents in Respect of 
Collateral. (a) Beyond the exercise of reasonable care in the custody 
thereof, the Collateral Agents shall have no duty as to any Collateral in 
its possession or control or in the possession or control of any agent or 
bailee or any income thereon or as to preservation of rights against prior 
parties or any other rights pertaining thereto and the Collateral Agents 
shall not be responsible for filing any financing or continuation 
statements or recording any documents or instruments in any public office 
at any time or times or otherwise perfecting or maintaining the perfection 
of any security interest in the Collateral. The Collateral Agents shall be 
deemed to have exercised reasonable care in the custody of the Collateral 
in their possession if the Collateral is accorded treatment substantially 
equal to that which they accord their own property and shall not be liable 
or responsible for any loss or diminution in the value of any of the 
Collateral, by reason of the act or omission of any carrier, forwarding 
agency or other agent or bailee selected by the Collateral Agents in good 
faith.
 
(b) Neither Collateral Agent shall be responsible for the existence, 
genuineness or value of any of the Collateral or for the validity, 
perfection, priority or enforceability of the Liens in any of the 
Collateral, whether impaired by operation of law or by reason of any action 
or omission to act on its part hereunder, except to the extent such action 
or omission constitutes gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct 
on the part of such Collateral Agent, for the validity or sufficiency of 
the Collateral or any agreement or assignment contained therein, for the 
validity of the title to the Collateral, for insuring the Collateral or for 
the payment of Taxes, charges, assessments or Liens upon the Collateral or 
otherwise as to the maintenance of the Collateral.
 
Section 10.10 Appointment of Collateral Agent. (a) Notwithstanding any 
other provisions of this Agreement, at any time, for the purpose of meeting 
any legal requirement of any jurisdiction in which any Collateral may at 
the time be located and for purposes of enforcement, either Collateral 
Agent shall have the power and may execute and deliver all instruments to 
appoint one (1) or more Persons to act as its agent of the Lenders of all 
or any part of the relevant Collateral, and to vest in such Person or 
Persons, in such capacity and for the benefit or on behalf of the Lenders, 
such title to the Collateral, or any part thereof, and such powers, duties, 
obligations, rights and trusts as such Collateral Agent may consider 
necessary or desirable, provided that the appointment of such agent shall 
be subject to the approval of the Majority Lenders, which approval shall 
not be unreasonably withheld, and provided further, that any such agent 
shall agree to be liable to the Lenders to the extent such Collateral Agent 
is so liable pursuant to this Agreement.
 
92
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
(b) All rights and powers, conferred or imposed upon either Collateral 
Agent may be conferred or imposed upon and may be exercised or performed by 
an agent.
 
(c) Any notice, request or other writing given to either Collateral Agent 
shall be deemed to have been given to each of the agents of such Collateral 
Agent as effectively as if given to each such agent. Every instrument 
appointing any agents shall refer to this Agreement.
 
(d) Any agent of either Collateral Agent may at any time appoint such 
Collateral Agent as its agent or attorney in fact with full power and 
authority, to the extent not prohibited by law, to do any lawful act under 
or in respect of this Agreement on its behalf and in its name.
 
(e) Neither Collateral Agent shall be responsible for any willful 
misconduct or negligence on the part of any agent appointed by such 
Collateral Agent with due care and in good faith pursuant to this Section.
 
ARTICLE XI
GUARANTEE
 
Section 11.1 Guarantee. (a) For good and valuable consideration, the 
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, each of the 
Guarantors hereby unconditionally and irrevocably, jointly and severally, 
guarantees the full and punctual payment of (x) Obligations, (y) all 
interest (including any interest that accrues after the commencement of any 
case, proceeding or other action relating to the bankruptcy, insolvency or 
reorganization of the Borrower (or would accrue but for the operation of 
applicable bankruptcy or insolvency laws, whether or not such interest is 
allowed or allowable as a claim in any such proceedings) on the Loans and 
(z) performance of all obligations (of any nature whatsoever) of the 
Borrower under the Loan Documents (each of clauses (x), (y) and (z), 
collectively, the Guaranteed Obligations), as primary obligor and not 
merely as surety and with respect to all such obligations howsoever 
created, arising or evidenced, whether direct or indirect, absolute or 
contingent, now or hereafter existing, or due or to become due. This is a 
guarantee of payment and not merely of collection. If the Borrower fails to 
pay any Obligation punctually when due, each Guarantor agrees that it will 
forthwith on demand pay the amount not so paid at the place and in the 
manner specified in this Agreement, which shall apply to each Guarantor in 
making payments hereunder as fully as though such Guarantor were the 
Borrower in making payments hereunder.
 
(b) All payments made by the Guarantors under this Article XI shall be 
payable in the manner required for payments by the Borrower hereunder, 
including: (i) the obligation to make all such payments free and clear of, 
and without deduction for, any Taxes (including withholding taxes), (ii) 
the obligation to pay interest at the Default Rate and (iii) the obligation 
to pay all amounts due under the Loans and the Notes in U.S. Dollars.
 
Section 11.2 Guarantee Unconditional. The obligations of each Guarantor 
under this Article XI shall be unconditional and absolute and, without 
limiting the generality of the foregoing, shall not be released, discharged 
or otherwise affected by:
 
(a) any extension, renewal, settlement, compromise, waiver or release in 
respect of any obligation(s) of any other Obligor under the Loan Documents 
and/or any Commitment(s) under the Loan Documents, by operation of law or 
otherwise,
 
93
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
(b) any modification or amendment of or supplement to this Agreement or any 
other Loan Document,
 
(c) any release, impairment, non-perfection or invalidity of any direct or 
indirect security for any obligation of the Borrower, any other Guarantor 
or any other Person under any Loan Document,
 
(d) any change in the corporate existence, structure or ownership of any 
other Obligor or any other Person, or any insolvency, bankruptcy, 
reorganization, recuperação judicial, recuperação extrajudicial, falência 
or other similar proceeding affecting any other Obligor or any other Person 
or any of their assets or any resulting release or discharge of any 
obligation of any other Obligor or any other Person under any Loan 
Document,
 
(e) the existence of any claim, set-off or other rights that any Guarantor 
may have at any time against any other Obligor, any Agent, any other Lender 
Party or any other Person, whether in connection herewith or with any

(f) any invalidity or unenforceability relating to or against any other 
Obligor, for any reason of any Loan Document, or any provision of 
Applicable Law purporting to prohibit the performance by any other Obligor 
of any of such Obligors obligations under the Loan Documents, or
 
(g) any other act or omission to act or delay of any kind by any other 
Obligor, any Agent, any other Lender Party or any other Person or any other 
circumstance whatsoever that might, but for the provisions of this Section, 
constitute a legal or equitable discharge of the obligations of such 
Obligor under the Loan Documents.
 
Section 11.3 Discharge Only Upon Payment in Full; Reinstatement In Certain 
Circumstances. The obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall remain in 
full force and effect until all of the payment and performance obligations 
of the Borrower under the Loan Documents shall have been paid or otherwise

any time any payment made under this Agreement or any other Loan Document 
is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned upon the insolvency, 
bankruptcy, reorganization, recuperação judicial, recuperação 
extrajudicial, falência or similar event of the Borrower or any other 
Person or otherwise, then the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder with 
respect to such payment shall be reinstated at such time as though such 
payment had been due but not made at such time.
 
Section 11.4 Waiver. Each Guarantor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally 
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law: (a) notice of 
acceptance of the Guarantee provided in this Article XI and notice of any 
liability to which this Guarantee may apply; (b) all notices that may be 
required by Applicable Law or otherwise to preserve intact any rights of 
any Lender Party against the Borrower, including any demand, presentment, 
protest, proof of notice of non-payment, notice, of any failure on the part 
of the Borrower to perform and comply with any covenant, agreement, term, 
condition or provision of any agreement and any other notice to any other 
party that may be liable in respect of the obligations Guaranteed hereby 
(including the Borrower) except any of the foregoing as may be expressly 
required hereunder; (c) any right to the enforcement, assertion or exercise 
by any Lender Party of any right, power, privilege or
 
94
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
remedy conferred upon such Person under the Loan Documents or otherwise; 
(d) any requirement that any Lender Party exhaust any right, power, 
privilege or remedy, or mitigate any damages resulting from a default, 
under any Loan Document, or proceed to take any action against any Rights 
or against the Borrower or any other Person under or in respect of any Loan 
Document or otherwise, or protect, secure, perfect or ensure any Lien on 
any Rights; and (e) the benefit of Articles 366, 821, 827, 829, 830, 834, 
835, 837, 838 and 839 of the Brazilian Civil Code, and Articles 77 and 595 
of the Brazilian Civil Procedure Code.
 
Section 11.5 Subrogation. Upon making a payment under this Article, each 
Guarantor shall be subrogated to the rights of the payee against the 
Borrower, as the case may be, with respect to such obligation; provided 
that the rights of each subrogated Guarantor will be subordinated to the 
rights of any Lender under the Credit Documents and each Guarantor hereby 
expressly, irrevocably and unconditionally waives in favor of the Lenders 
(but not in favor of any other creditors) any claims that it may have or 
hereafter acquire that arises from the existence, payment, performance or 
enforcement of such Guarantee, including any right of subrogation, 
indemnification, reimbursement or exoneration, and shall not exercise any 
other right against the Borrower or by reason of contribution against any 
other Guarantor (or otherwise benefit from any payment or other transfer 
arising from any such right), in each case, for so long as any payment 
obligations (other than on-going but not yet incurred indemnity 
obligations) of the Borrower remain unpaid and/or unsatisfied under the 
Loan Documents.
 
Section 11.6 Stay of Acceleration. If acceleration of the time for payment 
of any amounts payable under the Loan Documents is stayed due to any event 
described in Section 9.1(e), Section 9.1(f), or Section 9.1(g), then all 
such amounts otherwise subject to acceleration under this Agreement shall 
nonetheless be payable by each Guarantor hereunder immediately upon demand 
by the Administrative Agent.
 
ARTICLE XII
MISCELLANEOUS
 
Section 12.1 Waiver. No failure on the part of any Agent or any other 
Lender Party to exercise and no delay in exercising, and no course of 
dealing with respect to, any right, power or privilege under any Loan 
Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial 
exercise of any right, power or privilege under any Loan Document preclude 
any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, 
power or privilege. The remedies provided in the Loan Documents are 
cumulative and not exclusive of any other remedies provided by Applicable 
Law.
 
Section 12.2 Waiver of Security, Performance Bond, Etc. To the extent that 
any Obligor may be entitled to the benefit of any provision of Applicable 
Law requiring any Lender Party in any suit, action or proceeding brought in 
a court of Brazil or other jurisdiction arising out of or in connection 
with this Agreement, the Loans, the Notes, any of the other Loan Documents 
or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, to post security 
for litigation costs or otherwise post a performance bond or guarantee or 
to take any similar action, each of the Obligors hereby irrevocably waives 
such benefit, in each case to the fullest extent now or hereafter permitted 
under the laws of Brazil or any such other jurisdiction.

the case may be, in the manner specified in the Loan Documents but only to 
the extent requested by the Administrative Agent or the Majority Lenders.
 
Each Obligor hereby acknowledges that the Administrative Agent may make

behalf of the Lender Parties hereunder (collectively, the Obligor 
Materials) by posting the Obligor Materials on Intralinks
 
97
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
or another similar electronic system (the Platform). All such Obligor

the administration of this Agreement and the Loan Documents, the 
enforcement of the Collateral, any enforcement or collection proceedings 
resulting from the occurrence of an Event of Default, whether in any

suits, costs, claims, damages, disbursements or expenses (including, 
without limitation, any Environmental Claim) incurred by any of them as a

investigation, litigation, arbitration or other proceeding) relating to the 
Loan Documents and/or the use or proposed use by the Borrower of the 
proceeds of the Loans or the consummation of any transactions contemplated

to Taxes (for which a separate indemnity is provided in Section 4.5(b)) or 
by reason of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Person to be 
indemnified, as determined by a final, nonappealable judgment by a court of 
competent jurisdiction). In no event shall any Obligor or any Lender Party 
be liable to any Person for any punitive or consequential damages in 
connection with any of the Loan Documents, except that the Obligors shall 
indemnify the Lender Parties for any punitive or consequential damages
 
98
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
which are incurred by any Lender Party in connection with any third-party 
judgment imposed on such Lender Party in accordance with the immediately 
preceding sentence.
 
(c) To the extent that any undertaking in clause (b) may be unenforceable 
if it would violate any Applicable Law or public policy, the Obligors shall

date that is fifteen (15) Business Days after the date on which the 
Obligors were requested in writing to make such payment, be an Event of 
Default and bear interest from the date of such request at the Default 
Rate. The provisions of, and the obligations of the Obligors under, this 
Section 12.4 shall survive the termination of this Agreement.
 
Section 12.5 Benefit of Agreement. This Agreement shall be binding upon and 
inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the respective successors and 
assigns of the parties hereto, provided that, except as otherwise set forth 
in this Agreement, none of the Obligors may assign or transfer any of their 
rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the 
Administrative Agent and each of the Lenders (and any attempted assignment 
or transfer by the Borrower without such prior written consent shall be 
null and void ab initio).
 
Section 12.6 Amendments, Etc. Except as otherwise expressly provided in 
this Agreement and subject to Section 12.25, no amendment or waiver of any 
provision of this Agreement and (except as specifically provided therein) 
any other Loan Document, nor consent to any departure by any Obligor 
therefrom, shall in any event become effective unless the same shall be in 
writing and signed by the applicable Obligor(s), the Administrative Agent 
and the Majority Lenders (or the applicable Collateral Agent upon the 
written instruction of the Majority Lenders); provided that:
 
(a) no amendment, supplement or waiver, unless by an instrument signed by 
all Lenders shall: (i) increase, extend the term of or reinstate the

payment of principal of or interest on any Loans or any fee payable to the 
Lenders under the Loan Documents, (iii) reduce the amount of any payment of 
principal or any amount payable by any Obligor under any Loan Document or 
(iv) reduce the rate at which interest is payable thereon or any fee is 
payable to the Lenders under the Loan Documents.
 
(b) no amendment, supplement or waiver, unless by an instrument signed by 
all Lenders shall: (i) alter the terms of Section 3.6 or Section 3.9(b) or 
the terms of this Section 12.6 (or otherwise alter the pro rata treatment 
of the Lenders), (ii) release all or any portion of the Rights or the 
Collateral (except as expressly otherwise provided in the Loan Documents), 
(iii) release any Obligor from any payment obligation or indemnity under 
any Loan Document or the Guarantors from their respective Guarantees 
hereunder or modify any of the defined terms included therein, or (iv) 
modify the definition of the term Majority Lenders or Required Lenders

99
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Documents or to modify any provision thereof;
 
(c) no amendment, supplement or waiver, unless by an instrument signed by 
the Required Lenders shall release any Obligor from any obligation under 
Section 8.12;
 
(d) any modification or supplement of Article X, or of any of the rights or 
duties of an Agent under the Loan Documents, shall also require the consent 
of such Agent;

entered into solely by the parties thereto (it being understood that no 
other Person shall have any rights with respect thereto, including to 
receive a copy thereof); and
 
(f) the Administrative Agent may, with the consent of the Obligors only, 
amend, modify or supplement this Agreement to add any additional Guarantor 
pursuant to Section 8.25.
 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, each Lender 
agrees that neither the consent of the Majority Lenders nor the consent of 
any Lender individually shall be required in connection with the execution 
of one or more Facility Increase Amendments in order to implement the 
addition of Loans by Additional Lenders as contemplated in Section 2.1(b). 
No Obligor (nor any other Person on their behalf) shall directly or 
indirectly pay or cause to be paid any remuneration in any manner 
whatsoever to any Lender as consideration for or as an inducement to the 
entering into by such Lender of any waiver or amendment of any of the Loan 
Documents unless such remuneration is concurrently paid ratably to each 
Lender even if any such Lender is not required to or did not consent to 
such waiver or amendment.
 
Section 12.7 Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement is made and entered 
into for the sole protection and legal benefit of the parties hereto, the 
Lender Parties and their permitted successors and assigns and, to the 
extent provided herein, the Affiliates of the Lender Parties, and no other 
Person shall be a direct or indirect legal beneficiary of, or have any 
direct or indirect cause of action or claim in connection with, this 
Agreement.
 
Section 12.8 Assignments and Participations.
 
(a) Each Lender may, in accordance with Applicable Law and this Section 
12.8, assign its Loan or any portion thereof to any other Person (other 
than any Aracruz Party or any Affiliate thereof) by execution of an 
Assignment Agreement; provided that:
 
   (i) any such partial assignment (other than to another Lender) shall be
   in an amount at least equal to U.S.$1,000,000 or an integral multiple of
   U.S.$500,000 in excess thereof (or, if less, all of such Lenders
   remaining Loan);
    
   (ii) each such assignment shall be to an Eligible Assignee;
    
   (iii) upon each such assignment, the assignor and assignee shall deliver
   an Assignment Agreement to the Administrative Agent;
    
   (iv) the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the
   Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire; and
 
100
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
(v) each such assignment does not and will not constitute or otherwise 
result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of the U.S. 
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, or Section 
4975 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
 
(b) Upon the effective date of the assignment to be effected by an 
Assignment Agreement and registration thereof in the Register pursuant to 
Section 12.8(d), the assignee shall have, to the extent of such assignment, 
the obligations, rights and benefits of a Lender hereunder holding the 
Commitment (or portion thereof) assigned to it and specified in such 
Assignment Agreement (in addition to the Commitment, if any, theretofore 
held by such assignee), and the assigning Lender shall, to the extent of 
such assignment of its Commitment, be released from the Commitment (or 
portion thereof) so assigned. Upon its receipt of an Assignment Agreement 
executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee together with (except in 
the case of an assignment by a Lender to an Affiliate of such Lender) 
payment by the assigning or assignee Lender to the Administrative Agent of 
an assignment fee of U.S.$3,000, the Administrative Agent shall: (A) 
promptly accept such Assignment Agreement and (B) on the effective date 
determined pursuant thereto record such assignment in the Register and give 
notice of such acceptance and recordation to the assigning Lender, its 
assignee and the Obligors. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary 
contained herein, the Obligors shall not be obligated to pay to any Lender 
any amount under Section 4.1, Section 4.3, Section 4.4 and Section 4.5 that 
is greater than the amount that the Obligors would have been obligated to 
pay such Lenders assignor if such assigning Lender had not assigned to 
such Lender any of its rights under this Agreement, unless at the time such 
assignment is made: (1) the circumstances giving rise to such greater 
payments did not exist or (2) the Borrower consents in writing to such 
greater obligation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such assignment shall 
be allowed if the assignor thereof (if it is assigning less than all of its 
Loans) would, after such assignment, have less than U.S.$1,000,000 in Loans 
(such amount to be reduced on a pro rata basis upon the receipt of any 
payment of principal on the Loans) or Commitments. Any assignment in 
contravention of the provisions of this paragraph shall be null and void 
ab initio.
 
(c) Upon the request of the assigning Lender and presentment of its 
existing Note, the Borrower shall execute and deliver, in any event within 
seven (7) Business Days after its receipt of such notice, at the Borrowers 
expense, one (1) or more new Notes (as requested by the holder thereof) in 
exchange therefor, in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal 
amount of the surrendered Notes. Each such new Note shall be dated the 
effective date of the Assignment Agreement and in such principal amount and 
be payable to such Person as such holder may request and shall be 
substantially in the form of Exhibit A. Each such new Note shall be dated 
and bear interest from the date to which interest shall have been paid on 
the relevant surrendered Note(s) or dated the date of the relevant 
surrendered Note(s) if no interest shall have been paid thereon. Notes 
shall not be issued or transferred in denominations of less than 
U.S.$1,000,000; provided that if necessary to enable the registration of 
transfer by a holder of its entire holding of Notes, one (1) Note may be 
issued in a denomination of less than U.S.$1,000,000.
 
(d) The Administrative Agent shall maintain a copy of each Assignment 
Agreement delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names 
and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments and principal amount of 
the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to 
time (the Register). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive
 
101
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
in the absence of manifest error and the Borrower, the Agents and the 
Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register 
pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this 
Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. All payments under the 
Loan Documents or the Notes in respect of principal or interest shall be 
made to the appropriate Person named in the Register. The Register shall be 
available for inspection by the Borrower and any Lender, at any reasonable 
time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.
 
(e) A Lender may assign its Loans and its rights and obligations thereunder 
only by complying with the terms of this Agreement. No such assignment 
shall be effected until, and such assignee shall succeed to the rights of a 
holder only upon, final acceptance and registration of the assignment by 
the Administrative Agent in the Register. Prior to the registration of any 
assignment of Loans by a holder as provided herein, each Agent may treat 
the Person in whose name the Lenders are registered as the owner thereof 
for all purposes and as the Person entitled to exercise the rights 
represented thereby, any notice to the contrary notwithstanding. If 
requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, the assignee shall 
provide the Borrower with a fully executed U.S. Internal Revenue Service 
Form W-9 or applicable Form W-8 or such other forms or certificates 
evidencing such transferees exemption from backup withholding taxes 
imposed pursuant to Section 3406 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as 
amended, as may be reasonably requested by the Borrower.
 
(f) If any Lender assigns all or a part of its Loans and its rights and 
obligations hereunder to any other Person pursuant to the provisions 
hereof, the assigning Lender shall be relieved of its obligations hereunder 
with respect to the assigned Loans and Notes, and the assignee shall be a 
party hereto and, to the extent that Loans and Notes and such other rights 
and obligations hereunder have been assigned, shall acquire such Loans and 
Notes and other rights and obligations of a Lender hereunder and under the 
other Loan Documents, and this Agreement shall be deemed to be amended to 
the extent necessary to reflect the transfer and assignment of such rights 
and obligations and the addition of such assignee, and any reference to the 
assigning Lender in this Agreement, the other Loan Documents or the Notes 
of such Lender shall thereafter refer to such Lender and to such assignee 
to the extent of their respective interests.
 
(g) Upon receipt by the Borrower of evidence reasonably satisfactory to it 
of the ownership of and the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of any 
Notes, and
 
   (i) in the case of loss, theft or destruction, of indemnity reasonably
   satisfactory to each of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent; or
    
   (ii) in the case of mutilation, upon surrender and cancellation thereof,
    
the Borrower, at its own expense, shall execute and deliver, in lieu 
thereof, new Notes, dated and bearing interest from the date to which 
interest shall have been paid on such lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated 
Notes or dated the date of such lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated Notes 
if no interest shall have been paid thereon.
 
(h) A Lender may, in accordance with Applicable Law, without the consent of 
any Lender Party, sell or agree to sell to one (1) or more other Persons 
(other than any Aracruz
 
102
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Party or any Affiliate thereof) (each a Participant) a participation in 
all or a portion of such Lenders rights and obligations under this 
Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment, the Loans owing to 
it and the Note held by it); provided that such Participant shall not have 
any rights or obligations under this Agreement (the Participants rights 
against such Lender in respect of such participation to be those set forth 
in the agreements executed by such Lender in favor of the Participant). All 
amounts payable to any Lender under Article IV in respect of the Loans held 
by it, its Commitment or its Note, shall be determined as if such Lender 
had not sold or agreed to sell any participation in such Loan, Commitment 
or Note and as if such Lender were funding such Loans or Commitment in the 
same way that it is funding the portion of such Loans or Commitment in 
which no participations have been sold (or if all of its Loans or 
Commitment has been so participated, in the same way that it was funding 
such Loans or Commitment at the time of such participation). In no event 
shall a Lender that sells a participation agree with the Participant to 
take or refrain from taking any action hereunder except that such Lender 
may agree with the Participant that it shall not, without the consent of 
the Participant, agree to anything requiring the vote of 100% of the 
applicable Lenders hereunder.
 
(i) In addition to the assignments and participations permitted under the

RIACHO SECURITY DOCUMENTS, THE ARACRUZ SHARE PLEDGE AGREEMENT, THE ARACRUZ 
NOTE PLEDGE AGREEMENT, THE ALICIA SHARE PLEDGE AGREEMENT AND THE EXPORT

OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT MAY BE BROUGHT IN OR REMOVED

AGREEMENT, EACH PARTY ACCEPTS, FOR ITSELF AND IN RESPECT OF ITS PROPERTY, 
GENERALLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY, THE JURISDICTION OF THE AFORESAID COURTS 
(AND COURTS OF APPEALS THEREFROM) FOR LEGAL ACTIONS OR PROCEEDINGS ARISING 
OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS, 
WHICH JURISDICTION SHALL BE EXCLUSIVE IN THE CASE OF ANY LEGAL ACTION OR 
PROCEEDING BY ANY ARACRUZ PARTY (OTHER THAN COUNTERCLAIMS WITH RESPECT TO 
ANY LEGAL ACTIONS OR PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT AGAINST ANY ARACRUZ PARTY IN ANY 
OTHER JURISDICTION). EACH OF THE OBLIGORS IRREVOCABLY CONSENTS TO THE 
APPOINTMENT OF THE PROCESS AGENT (AS DEFINED BELOW) AS ITS AGENT TO RECEIVE 
SERVICE OF PROCESS (WITH RESPECT TO ALL OF THE LOAN DOCUMENTS AND ALL OTHER 
RELATED AGREEMENTS TO WHICH IT IS A PARTY) IN NEW YORK, NEW YORK.

any notice of any such service of process to it shall not impair or affect 
the validity of such service or, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, 
the enforcement of any judgment based thereon. Such appointment shall be 
irrevocable until the final payment of all amounts payable under this 
Agreement and the other Loan Documents, except that if for any reason the 
Process Agent appointed hereby ceases to be able to act as such, then the 
Obligor (as applicable) shall, by an instrument reasonably satisfactory to 
the Administrative Agent, appoint another Person in the Borough of 
Manhattan
 
104
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
as such Process Agent subject to the approval (which approval shall not be 
unreasonably withheld) of the Administrative Agent. Each Obligor covenants 
and agrees that it shall take any and all reasonable action, including the

continue the designation of the Process Agent pursuant to this paragraph in 
full force and effect and to cause the Process Agent to act as such.

Applicable Law or to obtain jurisdiction over any Person in such other 
jurisdictions, including but not limited to Brazil, and in such manner, as 
may be permitted by Applicable Law.
 
(d) Each party hereto hereby irrevocably waives any objection that it may 
now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any suit, action or 
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the other Loan 
Documents brought in or removed to New York City (and courts of appeals 
therefrom) and hereby further irrevocably waives any claim that any such 
suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an 
inconvenient forum. A final judgment (in respect of which time for all 
appeals has elapsed) in any such suit, action or proceeding shall be 
conclusive and may be enforced by suit upon judgment in any court in any 
jurisdiction to which the applicable Person is or may be subject.
 
(e) Each Obligor irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by 
Applicable Law, any claim that any action or proceeding commenced against 
it relating in any way to this Agreement and/or any of the other Loan 
Document(s) should be dismissed or stayed by reason, or pending the 
resolution, of any action or proceeding commenced by such Obligor relating 
in any way to this Agreement and/or the other Loan Documents, whether or 
not commenced earlier. To the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, 
each Obligor shall take all measures necessary for any such action or 
proceeding commenced against it to proceed to judgment before the entry of 
judgment in any such action or proceeding commenced by such Obligor.
 
Section 12.14 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO KNOWINGLY, 
VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVES ITS RIGHTS TO A TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY 
CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BASED UPON, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE LOAN 
DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY, IN ANY ACTION, 
LITIGATION OR OTHER PROCEEDING OF ANY TYPE BROUGHT BY ANY OF THE PARTIES 
AGAINST ANY OTHER PARTY OR ANY OTHER PERSON, WHETHER WITH RESPECT TO 
CONTRACT CLAIMS, TORT CLAIMS OR OTHERWISE. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO 
AGREES THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE TRIED IN A COURT 
TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, THE PARTIES FURTHER 
AGREE THAT THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IS WAIVED BY OPERATION 
OF THIS SECTION AS TO ANY ACTION, COUNTERCLAIM OR OTHER PROCEEDING THAT 
SEEKS, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, TO CHALLENGE THE VALIDITY OR ENFORCEABILITY OF 
THE LOAN DOCUMENTS OR ANY PROVISION THEREOF. THE AGREEMENT OF EACH PARTY 
HERETO TO THIS PROVISION IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT FOR EACH OF THE OTHER 
PARTIES HERETO TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT. THIS WAIVER IS IRREVOCABLE, 
MEANING THAT IT MAY NOT BE MODIFIED EITHER ORALLY OR IN WRITING (OTHER THAN 
BY A MUTUAL WRITTEN WAIVER SPECIFICALLY REFERRING TO THIS SECTION 12.14 AND
 
105
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
EXECUTED BY EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO THAT IS A PARTY IN ANY SUCH ACTION, 
LITIGATION OR PROCEEDING), AND THIS WAIVER SHALL APPLY TO ANY SUBSEQUENT 
AMENDMENTS, RENEWALS, SUPPLEMENTS OR MODIFICATIONS HERETO OR ANY OF THE 
OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS OR TO ANY OTHER DOCUMENTS OR AGREEMENTS RELATING TO 
THE LOANS MADE HEREUNDER, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT WAIVED IN WRITING AS SET 
FORTH ABOVE. IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, THIS AGREEMENT MAY BE FILED AS A 
WRITTEN CONSENT TO TRIAL BY THE COURT.
 
Section 12.15 Waiver of Immunity. To the extent that any Obligor may be or 
become entitled to claim for itself or its Property any immunity on the 
ground of sovereignty or the like from suit, court jurisdiction, attachment 
before judgment, attachment in aid of execution of a judgment or execution 
of a judgment, and to the extent that in any such jurisdiction there may be 
attributed such an immunity (whether or not claimed), it hereby irrevocably 
agrees not to claim and hereby irrevocably waives such immunity with 
respect to its obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan 
Documents.
 
Section 12.16 Judgment Currency. This is an international loan transaction 
in which the specification of U.S. Dollars and payment in New York City is 
of the essence, and the obligations of the Obligors under this Agreement 
and the other Loan Documents to each Lender Party to make payment in U.S. 
Dollars shall not be discharged or satisfied by any tender or recovery 
pursuant to any judgment expressed in or converted into any other currency 
or in another place except to the extent that on the Business Day following 
receipt of any sum adjudged to be so due in the judgment currency the payee 
may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase U.S. Dollars in 
the amount originally due to the payee with the judgment currency. If, for 
the purpose of obtaining judgment in any court, it is necessary to convert 
a sum due hereunder in U.S. Dollars into another currency (in this Section 
called the judgment currency), then the rate of exchange that shall be 
applied shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures 
the payee could purchase such U.S. Dollars at New York, New York with the 
judgment currency on the Business Day preceding the day on which such 
judgment is rendered. The obligations of the Obligors in respect of any 
such sum due from it to the payee hereunder (in this Section called an 
Entitled Person) shall, notwithstanding the rate of exchange actually 
applied in rendering such judgment, be discharged only to the extent that 
on the Business Day following receipt by such Entitled Person of any sum 
adjudged to be due hereunder in the judgment currency such Entitled Person 
may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase and transfer U.S. 
Dollars to New York City with the amount of the judgment currency so 
adjudged to be due; and each of the Obligors hereby, as a separate 
obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, agrees to indemnify such 
Entitled Person against, and to pay such Entitled Person on demand, in U.S. 
Dollars, the amount (if any) by which the sum originally due to such 
Entitled Person in U.S. Dollars hereunder exceeds the amount of the U.S. 
Dollars so purchased and transferred. If the amount of U.S. Dollars so 
purchased and transferred to the Entitled Person exceeds the amount 
originally due to such Entitled Person, then such Entitled Person shall 
transfer, or caused to be transferred, to the Borrower the amount of such 
excess.
 
Section 12.17 Use of English Language. This Agreement has been negotiated 
and executed in the English language. Except as specified otherwise herein 
all certificates, reports, notices and other documents and communications 
given or delivered pursuant to this Agreement
 
106
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
and the other Loan Documents (including any modifications or supplements 
hereto or thereto) shall be in the English language, or accompanied by an 
English translation thereof.
 
Section 12.18 Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the other Loan Documents 
constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the 
subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior or 
contemporaneous agreements and understandings of such Persons, verbal or 
written, relating to the subject matter hereof and thereof.
 
Section 12.19 Severability. The illegality or unenforceability in any 
jurisdiction of any provision hereof or of any document required hereunder 
shall not in any way affect or impair the legality or enforceability of the 
remaining provisions of this Agreement or such other document in such 
jurisdiction or such provision in any other jurisdiction.
 
Section 12.20 No Fiduciary Relationship or Partnership. Each of the 
Obligors acknowledges that neither any Agent nor any other Lender Party has 
any fiduciary relationship with, or fiduciary duty to, any Obligor arising 
out of or in connection with this Agreement or any other of the Loan 
Documents. Each of the Obligors recognizes that each Agent, each Lender 
Party and their respective Affiliates may have economic interests that 
conflict with those of the Borrower, its shareholders and/or its 
Affiliates. Each of the Obligors agrees that the relationship between the 
Administrative Agent and the Lenders, on the one hand, and the Obligors, on 
the other, in connection herewith or therewith is solely that of debtor and 
creditor and that nothing in the Loan Documents or otherwise shall be 
deemed to create an advisory, fiduciary or agency relationship or fiduciary 
or other implied duty between any Lender, on the one hand, and the 
Obligors, its shareholders or its Affiliates, on the other. Nothing 
contained in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document shall be deemed 
or construed to create a partnership; tenancy in common, joint tenancy, 
joint venture or co-ownership by or between any Lender on the one hand, and 
any other Lender, any Obligor or any other Person, on the other hand.
 
The Obligors acknowledge and agree that (i) the transactions contemplated 
by the Loan Documents (including the exercise of rights and remedies 
hereunder and thereunder) are arms-length commercial transactions between 
the Lenders, on the one hand, and the Obligors, on the other, and (ii) in 
connection therewith and with the negotiation of the Loan Documents, (x) no 
Lender Party has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor 
of any Obligor, its shareholders or its Affiliates with respect to the 
transactions contemplated hereby (or the exercise of rights or remedies 
with respect thereto) or the negotiation of the Loan Documents 
(irrespective of whether any Lender Party has advised, is currently 
advising or will advise any Obligor, its shareholders or its Affiliates on 
other matters) or any other obligation to any Obligor except the 
obligations expressly set forth in the Loan Documents and (y) each Lender 
Party is acting solely as principal and not as the agent or fiduciary of 
any Obligor, its management, shareholders, creditors or any other Person. 
Each Obligor acknowledges and agrees that it has consulted its own legal 
and financial advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate and that it is 
responsible for making its own independent judgment with respect to such 
transactions the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents. Each 
Obligor agrees that it will not claim that any Lender has rendered advisory 
services of any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to 
Obligor, in connection with such transaction or the process leading 
thereto. No Lender Party shall in any way be responsible or liable for the 
debts, losses, obligations or duties of the Obligors or any other Person 
other than itself.
 
107
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Section 12.21 Confidentiality. Each Lender Party agrees to hold all 
Confidential Information obtained pursuant to the Loan Documents or the 
transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with its customary procedure 
for handling such information of this nature and in accordance with safe 
and sound banking practices; provided that nothing herein shall prevent any 
Lender from disclosing such information: (a) to any Affiliate of such 
Lender Party and to their respective advisors or any other Lender or Agent 
solely in connection with the Loan Documents and the transactions 
contemplated thereby, (b) upon the order of any court or administrative 
agency or otherwise to the extent required by Applicable Law, (c) to bank 
examiners or upon the request or demand of any other regulatory agency or 
authority, (d) that had been publicly disclosed other than as a result of a 
disclosure by any Agent or Lender prohibited by this Agreement, (e) in 
connection with any litigation to which any one (1) or more of the Lenders 
or Agents (in each case, including to any of their respective employees, 
counsel, representatives or other agents) is a party, or in connection with 
the exercise of any remedy hereunder or under the, other Loan Documents, 
(f) to such Lenders or Agents legal counsel and independent auditors and 
accountants, (g) that was in such Lender Partys possession prior to the 
disclosure by any Aracruz Party to such Lender Party, provided that the 
source of such information was not known to such Lender Party to be bound 
by a confidentiality agreement with any Aracruz Party with respect to such 
information, (h) that is developed by such Lender or Agent independently of 
and without reference to any Confidential Information, (i) that is 
identified by the Obligors in writing as no longer to be considered 
Confidential Information, (j) to any actual or proposed participant or 
assignee provided that any actual or proposed participant or assignee has 
signed an agreement containing provisions substantially similar to or at 
least as restrictive as those contained in this Section 12.21 (including by 
cross reference to obligations of the Lender), and (k) to any actual or 
prospective counterparty (or its advisors) to any securitization, swap or 
derivative transaction relating the any Obligor and the Loan Documents that 
has signed an agreement containing provisions substantially similar to or 
at least as restrictive as those contained in this Section 12.21 (including 
by cross reference to obligations of the Lender); provided further that, 
(i) in the case of a disclosure of the type referred to in clauses (b), (c) 
and (e), such Lender or Agent shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable 
Law, promptly notify the relevant Obligor of such intended disclosure so 
that the relevant Obligor may take appropriate action to protect their 
respective interests and (ii) each Person to whom such disclosure is made 
will be informed of the confidential nature of such information and 
instructed to keep such information confidential on substantially the same 
terms as provided herein.
 
The terms contained in the Loan Documents are confidential and, except for 
disclosure to the various parties thereto, their respective shareholders 
and such Persons board of directors (or similar body), officers, 
Affiliates, employees or professional advisors, or as may be required by 
Applicable Law, may not be disclosed in whole or in part by any Obligor to 
any other Person without the prior written consent of the Administrative 
Agent (acting upon the direction of the Majority Lenders); provided that 
each Lender Party may disclose the existence of this Agreement and the 
information about this Agreement to market data collectors, similar 
services providers to the lending industry, and service providers to such 
Lender Party in connection with the administration and management of this 
Agreement and the other Loan Documents.
 
Section 12.22 Payments Set Aside. If any Obligor (or any Person on its 
behalf) makes a payment to any Lender Party, or any Lender Party exercises 
its right of set-off, and such payment or the proceeds of such set-off or 
any part thereof subsequently are invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or 
preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement 
entered into
 
108
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
by such Lender Party in its discretion) to be repaid to such Obligor (or 
such Person), a trustee, administrator, receiver or any other Person in 
connection with any insolvency proceeding or otherwise, then: (a) to the 
extent of such recovery, the obligation or part thereof originally intended 
to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as 
if such payment had not been made or such set-off had not occurred, and (b) 
each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Agent from whom it (or any 
related Lender Party) received any such amounts upon demand its pro rata 
share of any amount so recovered from or repaid by such Agent.

owing to any Lender, such Lender shall promptly upon written request from 
the Borrower surrender the corresponding Note to the Administrative Agent, 
which shall promptly surrender the same to the Borrower for cancellation.

requirements of the Patriot Act, the Administrative Agent (for itself and 
not on behalf of any Lender) and each Collateral Agent (for itself and not 
on behalf of any Lender) hereby notifies each party hereto that, pursuant 
to the requirements of the Patriot Act, it is required to obtain, verify 
and record information that identifies each such party, which information 
includes the name and address of each such party and other reasonable 
information that will allow such Lender, the Administrative Agent or either 
Collateral Agent, as applicable, to identify such party in accordance with 
the Patriot Act.
 
Section 12.25 Loans Held by the Aracruz Parties or their Affiliates. If, 
notwithstanding the provisions of Section 12.8(a), any Aracruz Party or any 
Affiliate thereof is or becomes a Lender, in determining whether the 
Lenders of the requisite aggregate Commitments or requisite aggregate 
principal amount of the Loans outstanding have concurred in any direction, 
consent or waiver under this Agreement, any Loans held by any such Persons 
shall be disregarded and not be deemed Loans for the purpose of any such 
determination.

the U.S. Collateral Agent thereof and (ii) if requested by the U.S. 
Collateral Agent (acting upon instructions of the Administrative Agent), 
deliver to the U.S. Collateral Agent a supplement to this Agreement in form

Agent a security interest in such Commercial Tort Claim.
 
(c) Other Financing Statements and Liens. Without the prior written consent 
of the U.S. Collateral Agent (acting upon instructions of the

   additional rights and remedies to which a secured party is entitled
   under the Applicable Laws in effect in any jurisdiction where any rights
   and remedies hereunder may be asserted, including the right, to the
   maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law, to exercise all powers of
   ownership pertaining to the Collateral as if the U.S. Collateral Agent
   were the sole and absolute owner thereof (and each of the Borrower and

   reasonably requested by the U.S. Collateral Agent to give effect to such
   right),

C-8
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
   for cash or for credit or for future delivery (without thereby assuming
   any credit risk), at public or private sale, without demand of
   performance or notice of intention to effect any such disposition or of
   the time or place thereof (except such notice as is required above or by
   Applicable Law and cannot be waived), and any Person (including the U.S.

   lessee, assignee or recipient of any or all of the Collateral at any

   claim or right of whatsoever kind, including any right or equity of
   redemption (statutory or otherwise), of the Borrower or Aracruz

   or is of a type customarily sold on a recognized market, and
    
   (v) any action taken by the U.S. Collateral Agent hereunder shall be
   taken in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner.
    
Each of the Borrower and Aracruz Celulose acknowledges that, by reason of 
prohibitions contained in the United States Securities Act of 1933, as 
amended, and applicable state securities laws, there may be a need, with 
respect to any sale of all or any part of the Collateral constituting 
securities, to limit purchasers to those who agree, among other things, to 
acquire the Collateral for their own account, for investment and not with a 
view to the distribution or resale thereof. If any such sale of Collateral 
is made in accordance with this Agreement, then the parties hereto 
acknowledge (and each Secured Party shall be deemed to have acknowledged) 
that any price obtained in a public or private sale of such Collateral 
shall be conclusive and binding upon each of the parties thereto and hereto 
(and each of the Secured Parties), to the extent permitted by Applicable 
Law. Nothing herein shall be deemed to be a waiver by either the Borrower 
or Aracruz Celulose of its respective rights under the UCC.
 
(f) Deficiency. If the proceeds of collection or other realization of or 
upon the Collateral are insufficient to cover the costs and expenses of 
such realization and the payment in full of the Secured Obligations, then 
the Borrower and Aracruz Celulose shall remain liable for any deficiency.
 
(g) Books and Records; UCC Matters. Each of the Borrower and Aracruz 
Celulose agrees to furnish to the U.S. Collateral Agent upon at least 30 
days prior written notice of any of the following: (i) a change in its 
legal name from that indicated in the introductory statement to this 
Agreement and in its organizational documents as filed with its 
jurisdiction of organization; (ii) a change in its organizational legal 
entity designation from that indicated in the introductory statement to 
this Agreement; (iii) a change in its jurisdiction of incorporation or 
formation from
 
C-9
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
that indicated in the introductory statement to this Agreement and (iv) a 
change in the location of its chief executive office from that indicated in 
the introductory statement to this Agreement. Each of the Borrower and 
Aracruz Celulose agrees not to effect or permit any change referred to in 
the preceding sentence unless it is otherwise permitted by the Credit 
Agreement and all filings have been made under the Uniform Commercial Code 
or other Applicable Law that are required in order for the U.S. Collateral 
Agent to continue at all times following such change to have a valid, legal 
and perfected, security interest in the Collateral.
 
(h) Private Sale. It acknowledges (and each Secured Party will be deemed to 
have acknowledged) that any private sale of any of the Collateral may be at 
prices and on terms less favorable than those obtainable through a public 
sale and agrees (or will be deemed to have agreed) that any such private 
sale pursuant to Section 3.1(e)(iii) made in accordance with Applicable Law 
shall be deemed to have been made in a commercially reasonable manner and 
that the U.S. Collateral Agent shall have no obligation to engage in public 
sales unless required by any Applicable Law. Neither the U.S. Collateral 
Agent nor any of the other Secured Parties shall incur any liability as a 
result of the sale of the Collateral, or any part thereof, at any private 
sale conducted in a commercially reasonable manner and made in accordance 
with Applicable Law. Each of the Borrower and Aracruz Celulose hereby 
waives (and each Secured Party will be deemed to have waived) any claims 
against the U.S. Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party arising by 
reason of the fact that the price at which the Collateral may have been 
sold at such a private sale made in accordance with Applicable Law was less 
than the price that might have been obtained at a public sale or was less 
than the aggregate amount of the Secured Obligations, even if the U.S. 
Collateral Agent accepts the first offer received and does not offer such 
sold Collateral to more than one offeree.
 
(i) Clean Sale. Upon any sale of Collateral under this Section made in 
accordance with Applicable Law, the U.S. Collateral Agent shall have the 
right to deliver, assign and transfer to the purchaser thereof the 
Collateral so sold. Each purchaser at any such sale shall hold the 
Collateral so sold to it absolutely and free from any Lien, claim or right 
of any kind, and each of the Borrower and Aracruz Celulose, to the extent 
permitted by Applicable Law, hereby specifically waives all rights of 
redemption, stay or appraisal that it has or may have under any Applicable 
Law with respect thereto. The Borrower shall execute and deliver such 
documents and take such other actions as the U.S. Collateral Agent (acting 
upon written instructions of the Administrative Agent) deems necessary or 
advisable in order that any such sale may be made in compliance with 
Applicable Law.
 
(j) Application of Proceeds. The proceeds of any sale or disposition of all 
or any part of the Collateral shall be applied as provided in the Credit 
Agreement.
 
(k) Attorney-in-Fact. Without limiting any rights or powers granted by this 
Agreement to the U.S. Collateral Agent while no Acceleration Event or 
Non-Payment Event of Default exists, during the existence of any 
Acceleration Event or Non-Payment Event of Default, the U.S. Collateral 
Agent is hereby appointed the attorney-in-fact of each of the Borrower and 
Aracruz Celulose for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this 
Article and taking any action and executing and delivering any documents 
that the U.S. Collateral Agent (acting at the written instructions of the 
Administrative Agent, as directed by the Majority Lenders) may deem 
necessary or advisable to accomplish the purposes hereof provided that any 
action taken by the
 
C-10
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
U.S. Collateral Agent is taken or made in good faith and in a commercially 
reasonable manner, which appointment as attorney-in fact is irrevocable and 
coupled with an interest; it being understood that the grant of an 
attorney-in-fact is subject at all times to Section 2.3(c) hereof. Without 
limiting the generality of the foregoing, so long as the U.S. Collateral 
Agent shall be entitled under this Article to make collections in respect 
of the Collateral, the U.S. Collateral Agent shall have the right and power 
to receive, endorse and collect all checks and other instruments made 
payable to the order of the Borrower and/or Aracruz Celulose representing 
any payment or other distribution in respect of the Collateral (including 
the Designated Receivables) or any part thereof and to give full discharge 
for the same.
 
(l) Termination. If and when all of the Secured Obligations shall have been 
finally paid in full (other than any indemnification obligations not yet 
incurred), this Agreement shall terminate upon written notice from the 
Administrative Agent to the U.S. Collateral Agent and the U.S. Collateral 
Agent shall (at the written request and direction of the Borrower and at 
the Borrowers cost and expense): (i) cause to be assigned, transferred and 
delivered, against receipt but without any recourse; warranty or 
representation whatsoever, any remaining Collateral (including funds 
received in respect thereof) to or on the order of the Borrower; (ii) 
deliver to the Borrower any Collateral or other Property of the Borrower or 
Aracruz Celulose in the possession of the U.S. Collateral Agent; and (iii) 
execute and file or deliver lien releases, Uniform Commercial Code 
termination statements and notices of termination of the U.S. Account 
Control Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Liens created by this 
Agreement on any Products sold under the Sales Agreements shall 
automatically terminate upon any such sale or use.
 
(m) Further Assurances. It shall, at its own cost, promptly take all 
actions as may be required by Applicable Law or reasonably requested by the 
U.S. Collateral Agent (acting upon instructions of the Administrative 
Agent) to maintain the Lien created hereby in full force and effect and 
enforceable in accordance with its terms, including, without limitation, 
any such actions that may be necessary or desirable in any applicable 
non-U.S. jurisdiction and including: (i) making necessary filings and 
recordations, (ii) making payments of documented fees and other charges, 
(iii) issuing and, if necessary, filing or recording supplemental 
documentation, including continuation statements, (iv) discharging all 
claims or other Liens adversely affecting the rights of the U.S. Collateral 
Agent or any other Secured Party in any Collateral, (v) publishing or 
otherwise delivering notice to third parties, (vi) depositing title 
documents, (vii) taking such other steps as are necessary or as otherwise 
the U.S. Collateral Agent may reasonably request to perfect and maintain 
the perfection of the security interest in the Collateral and (viii) taking 
all other actions as may be required by Applicable Law or as reasonably 
requested by the U.S. Collateral Agent to ensure that all after-acquired 
property of the Borrower intended to be covered by such Liens is subject to 
a valid and enforceable first priority perfected Lien in favor of the U.S. 
Collateral Agent (on behalf of the Secured Parties).
 
(n) Collections. It shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause 
to be collected from the Eligible Offtaker obligated under each Sales 
Agreement, as and when due (including amounts that are delinquent), any and 
all amounts owing under or on account of the Designated Receivables, and 
shall apply promptly upon payment thereof all such amounts as are so 
collected to the outstanding balance of such Designated Receivables. Other 
than in the ordinary course of business, the Borrower shall not adjust, 
settle or compromise the amount or
 
C-11
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
payment of any Designated Receivable or Intercompany Obligation, or release 
wholly or partly any Eligible Offtaker or obligor thereof, or allow any 
credit or discount thereon. The costs and expenses (including attorneys 
fees) of collection, whether incurred by the Borrower or Aracruz Celulose, 
on the one hand, or by the U.S. Collateral Agent, on the other hand, shall 
be a joint and several obligation of the Borrower and Aracruz Celulose and 
shall constitute, if paid by the U.S. Collateral Agent, Secured Obligations 
hereunder.
 
(p) Collateral. Each of the Borrower and Aracruz Celulose shall perform in 
all material respects all of its obligations with respect to the 
Collateral.
 
(q) Acceleration Event or Non-Payment Event of Default. The U.S. Collateral 
Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of 
an Acceleration Event or a Non-Payment Event of Default unless it has 
received written notice from the Administrative Agent or the Borrower 
specifying such Acceleration Event or Non-Payment Event of Default. The 
U.S. Collateral Agent shall take such action with respect to any 
Acceleration Event or Non-Payment Event of Default as the Majority Lenders 
shall direct; provided that unless and until the Collateral Agent shall 
have received such directions, it may (but shall not be obligated to) take 
such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such 
Acceleration Event or Non-Payment Event of Default as it shall deem 
advisable in the best interest of the Secured Parties except to the extent 
that the Loan Documents expressly require that such action be taken, or not 
be taken, only with the consent or upon the authorization of the Majority 
Lenders.

filing of any and all documents, that may be necessary to continue the 
designation of the Process Agent pursuant to this paragraph in full force

or to obtain jurisdiction over the Borrower or Aracruz Celulose in such 
other jurisdictions, and in such manner, as may be permitted by Applicable

further irrevocably waives any claim that any such suit, action or 
proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient 
forum. A final judgment (in respect of which time for all appeals has

be enforced by suit upon judgment in any court in any jurisdiction to which 
the Borrower or Aracruz Celulose is or may be subject.
 
(e) Each of the Borrower and Aracruz Celulose irrevocably waives, to the

reason, or pending the resolution, of any action or proceeding commenced by 
the Borrower or Aracruz Celulose relating in any way to this Agreement

earlier. To the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, each of the

before the entry of judgment in any such action or proceeding commenced by 
the Borrower or Aracruz Celulose.

VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVES ITS RIGHTS TO A TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY

TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, THE PARTIES FURTHER 
AGREE THAT THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IS WAIVED BY OPERATION 
OF THIS SECTION AS TO ANY ACTION, COUNTERCLAIM OR OTHER PROCEEDING THAT 
SEEKS, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, TO CHALLENGE THE VALIDITY OR ENFORCEABILITY OF 
THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY PROVISION HEREOF. THE AGREEMENT OF EACH PARTY HERETO 
TO THIS PROVISION IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT FOR EACH OF THE OTHER PARTIES 
HERETO TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT.
 
Section 5.13 Severability. The illegality or unenforceability in any

agrees to comply with entitlement orders of, or instructions directing 
distribution of uninvested funds from, such Person or (ii) any other 
agreement with ATI, Aracruz Celulose or any other Person purporting to 
limit or condition the obligation of the Intermediary to comply with 
entitlement orders and instructions directing distribution of uninvested

D-4
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
the U.S. Collateral Agent as set forth in Section 5. The Intermediary shall

Collateral Accounts other than the U.S. Collateral Agent, ATI or Aracruz

the U.S. Collateral Agent asserts any Lien, claim or interest (including 
any writ, garnishment, judgment, warrant of attachment, execution or 
similar process) against the Collateral Accounts or in respect of any 
financial asset credited thereto or uninvested funds on deposit therein,

ATI thereof.

to the U.S. Collateral Agent and the Intermediary have been granted in 
order to perfect the U.S. Collateral Agents security interests in the 
Collateral Accounts, are powers coupled with an interest and are not 
intended to be affected by the bankruptcy (or similar event) of ATI or 
Aracruz Celulose or the lapse of time. The obligations of the Intermediary 
hereunder shall continue in effect until the security interest of the U.S. 
Collateral Agent in the Collateral Accounts has been terminated pursuant to 
the Security Agreement and the U.S. Collateral Agent has notified the 
Intermediary of such termination in writing. The Intermediary may at any 
time resign by giving at least 30 days prior written notice of resignation 
to the U.S. Collateral Agent, ATI and Aracruz Celulose, and may at any time 
(with or without cause) be removed by the U.S. Collateral Agent by giving 
at least 30 days prior written notice to the Intermediary from the U.S. 
Collateral Agent, and such resignation or removal shall be effective upon 
the appointment by the U.S. Collateral Agent of a successor and the 
acceptance by the successor of such appointment.
 
SECTION 11. Waiver. No failure on the part of the U.S. Collateral Agent or 
any other Secured Party to exercise and no delay in exercising, and no 
course of dealing with respect to, any right, power or privilege under this 
Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or 
partial exercise of any right, power or privilege under this Agreement 
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other 
right, power or privilege. The remedies provided in this Agreement are 
cumulative and not exclusive of any other, remedies provided by Applicable 
Law.
 
SECTION 12. Notices. All notices, requests, instructions, directions and 
other communications provided for herein (including any modifications of, 
or waivers, requests or consents under, this Agreement) shall be given or 
made in writing (including by facsimile) delivered to: (a) any of ATI,

Agreement; it being understood that if such Collateral or proceeds 
therefrom are Brazilian Collateral, such Collateral or proceeds therefrom 
shall be delivered to the Brazil Collateral Agent, and if such Collateral 
and proceeds are U.S. Collateral, such Collateral and Proceeds shall be 
delivered to the U.S. Collateral Agent. Until such time as the provisions 
of the immediately preceding sentence have been complied with, such Secured 
Party, Administrative Agent or Additional Administrative Agent shall be 
deemed to hold such Collateral or proceeds therefrom in trust for the 
parties entitled thereto hereunder.

SECTION 5. The Collateral Agent.
 
5.1. Appointment of the Collateral Agent.
 
(a) Each Additional Administrative Agent, acting on behalf of the Lenders 
party to a Refinancing Agreement pursuant to which such Additional 
Administrative Agent is administrative agent, and each Additional Bilateral 
Lender hereby appoints and authorizes the U.S. Collateral Agent to act as 
its agent hereunder and (as applicable) under the Collateral Documents and 
other Financing Agreements to which the U.S. Collateral Agent is a party 
with such powers as are specifically delegated to the U.S. Collateral Agent 
by the terms of this Agreement and (as applicable) the Collateral Documents 
and other Financing Agreements to which the U.S. Collateral Agent is a 
party, and together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental 
thereto.
 
(b) Each Additional Lender hereby appoints, designates, and irrevocably 
undertakes to execute, through a public deed, a power of attorney 
substantially in the form of Schedule 3 hereto, appointing, authorizing and 
designating, the Brazil Collateral Agent as its attorney-in- fact, 
conferring upon the Brazil Collateral Agent hereby and pursuant to such 
power of attorney, all necessary powers to enter into and act as its agent 
and attorney-in-fact in connection with this Agreement, the Collateral 
Documents and other Financing Agreements to which the Brazil Collateral 
Agent is a party and to take such action as agent on its behalf and to 
exercise such powers under this Agreement, the Collateral Documents and 
such Financing Agreements as are conferred upon the Brazil Collateral Agent 
by the terms hereof or thereof, together with all such powers as are 
reasonably incidental thereto. Each Additional Lender hereby acknowledges 
and agrees that it is a requirement of Brazilian applicable law that the 
Brazil Collateral Agent be appointed by means of a power of attorney 
executed through a public deed pursuant to the terms of this Section 
5.1(b). If any Additional Lender elects to cause its Additional 
Administrative Agent or any other Person to appoint the Brazil Collateral 
Agent as collateral agent with respect to the Brazilian Collateral on its 
behalf, such Additional Lender agrees to deliver to such Person a power of 
attorney substantially in the form of Schedule 4, executed through a public 
deed. For the avoidance of doubt, any Person appointing the Brazil 
Collateral Agent as collateral agent with respect to the Brazilian 
Collateral upon instructions of an Additional Lender pursuant to the 
previous sentence shall deliver to the Brazil Collateral Agent a power of 
attorney substantially in the form of Schedule 3 hereto, executed through a 
public deed, conferring to the Brazil Collateral Agent the powers described 
in this Section 5.1(b).
 
(c) Each Collateral Agent (which term as used in this Agreement shall 
include reference to its respective Affiliates and its own and its 
respective Affiliates officers, directors, employees, representatives and 
agents):
 
   (i) shall have no duties or responsibilities except those expressly set
   forth in this Agreement, the Collateral Documents and other Financing
   Agreements to which such Collateral Agent is a party and shall not by
   reason of this Agreement, the Collateral Documents or any Financing
   Agreements to which it is a party be deemed to be a trustee or fiduciary
   for any Additional Administrative Agent acting on behalf of the Lender
   party to a Refinancing Agreement or for any Additional Bilateral Lender,
 
J-10
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
   (ii) shall not be responsible to any Additional Administrative Agent
   acting on behalf of any Lender party to a Refinancing Agreement or to
   any Additional Bilateral Lender for any recitals, statements,
   representations or warranties contained this Agreement, the Collateral
   Documents or any Financing Agreements to which it is a party, or in any
   certificate or other document referred to or provided for in, or
   received by any of them under, this Agreement, the Collateral Documents
   or any Financing Agreements to which it is a party, or for the value,
   validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of
   the Collateral or this Agreement, the Collateral Documents or any
   Financing Agreements to which it is a party or any other document
   referred to or provided for herein or therein or for any failure by any
   Obligor to perform any of its obligations hereunder or thereunder,
    
   (iii) shall not be required to initiate or conduct any litigation or
   collection proceedings under this Agreement, the Collateral Documents or
   any Financing Agreements to which it is a party,
    
   (iv) shall not be responsible for any action taken or omitted to be
   taken by it hereunder or under any other document referred to or
   provided for herein or in connection herewith, except for its own gross
   negligence or willful misconduct,
    
   (v) shall not be bound to make any investigation into the facts or
   matters stated in any certificate, statement, instrument, opinion,
   report, notice, request, direction, consent, order or other paper or
   document,
    
   (vi) shall not be responsible or liable for special, indirect, punitive
   or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever (including, but
   not limited to, loss of profit) irrespective of whether such Collateral
   Agent has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage and
   regardless of the form of action, and
    
   (vii) in no event shall be responsible or liable for any failure or
   delay in the performance of its obligations hereunder arising out of or
   caused by, directly or indirectly, forces beyond its control, including,
   without limitation strikes, work stoppages, accidents, acts of war or
   terrorism, civil or military disturbances, nuclear or natural
   catastrophes or acts of God, and interruptions, loss or malfunctions of
   utilities, communications or computer (software and hardware) services; 
   it being understood that either Collateral Agent shall use reasonable
   efforts which are consistent with accepted practices in the banking
   industry to resume performance as soon as practicable under the
   circumstances.
    
(d) Before either Collateral Agent acts or refrains from acting, it may 
require an officers certificate from any Obligor and/or an opinion of 
counsel satisfactory to it with respect to the proposed action or inaction. 
Neither Collateral Agent shall be liable for any action it takes or omits 
to take in good faith in reliance upon such certificate or opinion. 
Whenever in the administration of this Agreement, the Collateral Documents 
or any Financing Agreement to which it is a party, either Collateral Agent 
shall deem it necessary or desirable that a matter be provided or 
established before taking or suffering or omitting to take any act under 
this Agreement, the Collateral Documents or any Financing Agreement to 
which it is a party, such
 
J-11
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
matter (unless other evidence in respect thereof is herein specifically 
prescribed) may, in the absence of gross negligence or bad faith on the 
part of such Collateral Agent, be deemed to be conclusively proved and 
established by an officers certificate delivered to it, and such 
certificate, in the absence of gross negligence or bad faith on the part of 
such Collateral Agent, shall be full warrant to such Collateral Agent for 
any action taken, suffered or omitted to be taken by it under this 
Agreement, the Collateral Documents or any Financing Agreement to which it 
is a party upon the faith thereof.
 
(e) Any Person: (i) into which either Collateral Agent may be merged or 
consolidated or (ii) that may result from any merger, conversion or 
consolidation to which either Collateral Agent shall be a party shall (if 
such Collateral Agent is not the surviving entity) be its successor without 
the execution or filing of any instrument or any further act on the part of 
any of the parties hereto.
 
(f) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, at any time, 
for the purpose of meeting any legal requirement of any jurisdiction in 
which any Collateral may at the time be located and for purposes of 
enforcement, the Collateral Agents shall have the power and may execute and 
deliver all instruments to appoint one or more Persons to act as agent of 
the Secured Parties of all or any part of the Collateral and to vest in 
such Person or Persons, in such capacity and for the benefit or on behalf 
of the Secured Parties, such title to the Collateral, or any part thereof, 
and such powers, duties, obligations, rights and trusts as the Collateral 
Agent may consider necessary or desirable; provided that the appointment of 
such agent shall be subject to the approval of the Aggregate Required 
Interest Holders, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld; 
provided further, that any such agent shall agree to be liable to the 
Secured Parties to the extent the applicable Collateral Agent is so liable 
pursuant to this Agreement.
 
(g) All rights and powers, conferred or imposed upon the Collateral Agents 
may be conferred or imposed upon and may be exercised or performed by an 
agent appointed pursuant to Section 5.1(f); provided that, if the Brazil 
Collateral Agent appoints any agent pursuant to Section 5.1(f) with respect 
to the Brazil Collateral, such appointment shall be made by means of the 
execution of a power-of-attorney through a public deed substantially in the 
form of Schedule 5 hereto.
 
(h) Any notice, request or other writing given to either Collateral Agent 
shall be deemed to have been given to each of the agents appointed pursuant 
to Section 5.1(f) as effectively as if given to each of them. Every 
instrument appointing any such agents shall refer to this Agreement.
 
(i) Any agent appointed pursuant to Section 5.1(f) may at any time appoint 
either Collateral Agent as its agent or attorney in fact with full power 
and authority, to the extent not prohibited by law, to do any lawful act 
under or in respect of this Agreement on its behalf and in its name.
 
(j) The Collateral Agent shall not be responsible for any willful 
misconduct or negligence on the part of any agent appointed by it with due 
care and in good faith pursuant to this Section.
 
J-12
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
5.2. Reliance By The Collateral Agent. Each Collateral Agent shall be 
entitled to rely conclusively upon any certification, notice or other 
communication (including any thereof by facsimile) reasonably believed by 
it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed or sent by or on 
behalf of the appropriate Person(s), and upon advice and statements of 
legal counsel and other experts selected by such Collateral Agent.
 
5.3. Non-Reliance upon the Collateral Agent and Lenders party to any 
Refinancing Agreement.
 
Each Additional Administrative Agent acting on behalf of the Lenders party 
to a Refinancing Agreement pursuant to which such Additional Administrative 
Agent is administrative agent and each Additional Bilateral Lender agrees 
that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Collateral Agents 
or any other Lender, and based upon such documents and information as it 
has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis of the Obligors and 
decision to become a Lender and that it will, independently and without 
reliance upon the Collateral Agents or any other Lender, and based upon 
such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, 
continue to make its own analysis and decisions in taking or not taking 
action under this Agreement, the Collateral Documents and the Refinancing 
Agreement to which it is a party. Each Collateral Agent shall be required 
to keep itself informed as to the performance or observance by any Obligor 
of this Agreement, the Collateral Documents to which such Collateral Agent 
is a party, any Financing Document to which it is a party or any other 
document referred to or provided for herein or to inspect the properties or 
books of any Obligor (as permitted under the Financing Agreements). Neither 
Collateral Agent shall have any or responsibility to provide any Lender 
with any credit or other information concerning the affairs, financial 
condition or business of any Obligor that may come into the possession of 
such Collateral Agent.
 
5.4. Liability of the Collateral Agent.
 
(a) Neither Collateral Agent shall be liable for any action taken or not 
taken by it in connection herewith with the consent or at the request of 
the Aggregate Required Interest Holders, except if such action was taken or 
omitted as a result of such Collateral Agents own gross negligence or 
willful misconduct.
 
(b) Without limiting any other provision of this Agreement, neither 
Collateral Agent shall have any responsibility or liability with respect to 
the perfection or priority of any security interest created or the 
effectiveness of the power-of-attorney contemplated by this Agreement, the 
Collateral Documents or any other Financing Agreement to which it is a 
party. Neither Collateral Agent makes any representation or warranty as to 
the value or condition of the Collateral, or any part thereof, as to the 
title of any Obligor or any other Person thereto or as to the validity, 
execution, enforceability, legality or sufficiency of this Agreement, the 
Collateral Documents or the other Financing Agreements to which it is a 
party, and it shall not incur any liability or responsibility in respect of 
any such matters.
 
(c) Beyond the exercise of reasonable care in the custody thereof, neither 
Collateral Agent shall have any duty as to any Collateral in its possession 
or control or in the possession or control of any agent or bailee or any 
income thereon or as to preservation of rights against prior
 
J-13
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
parties or any other rights pertaining thereto and neither Collateral Agent 
shall be responsible for filing any financing or continuation statements or 
recording any documents or instruments in any public office at any time or 
times or otherwise perfecting or maintaining the perfection of any security 
interest in the Collateral. Each Collateral Agent shall be deemed to have 
exercised reasonable care in the custody of the Collateral in its 
possession if such Collateral is accorded treatment substantially equal to 
that which such Collateral Agent accords its own property and shall not be 
liable or responsible for any loss or diminution in the value of any of the 
Collateral, by reason of the act or omission of any carrier, forwarding 
agency or other agent or bailee selected by such Collateral Agent in good 
faith.
 
(d) Neither Collateral Agent shall be responsible for the existence, 
genuineness or value of any of the Collateral or for the validity, 
perfection, priority or enforceability of the Liens in any of the 
Collateral, whether impaired by operation of law or by reason of any action 
or omission to act on its part hereunder, except to the extent such action 
or omission constitutes gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct 
on the part of such Collateral Agent, for the validity or sufficiency of 
the Collateral or any agreement or assignment contained therein, for the 
validity of the title to the Collateral, for insuring the Collateral or for 
the payment of taxes, charges, assessments or Liens upon the Collateral or 
otherwise as to the maintenance of the Collateral.
 
5.5. Notice of Default.
 
Neither Collateral Agent shall be deemed to have actual, constructive, 
direct or indirect notice or knowledge of the occurrence of any Default 
unless and until it shall have received a written notice indicating that 
any Default has occurred. Upon receipt of such notice, each Collateral 
Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to the Lenders, to the Obligors and 
to the Administrative Agent and any Additional Administrative Agent. 
Neither Collateral Agent shall have any obligation whatsoever, either prior 
to or after receiving any such notice, to inquire whether a Default has, in 
fact, occurred and shall be entitled to rely conclusively, and shall be 
protected in so relying, on any such notice so furnished to it.
 
5.6. Successor Collateral Agent.
 
Each Collateral Agent may, upon thirty (30) days prior notice, resign at 
any time by giving notice thereof to the Obligors and the Administrative 
Agent, each Additional Administrative Agent and each Additional Bilateral 
Lender, and each Collateral Agent may, upon thirty (30) days prior notice, 
be removed at any time with or without cause by the Aggregate Required 
Interest Holders. Upon any such resignation or removal, the Aggregate 
Required Interest Holders (if no Default or Event of Default has occurred 
and is continuing, with the written consent of Aracruz Celulose, acting on 
behalf of the Obligors, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or 
delayed) shall have the right to appoint a successor Collateral Agent, by 
means of an agreement substantially in the form of Schedule 2 hereto, to 
replace the resigning Collateral Agent. If no successor Collateral Agent 
shall have been so appointed by the Aggregate Required Interest Holders 
(with the written consent of Aracruz Celulose, acting on behalf of the 
Obligors, if applicable) and shall have accepted such appointment, within 
30 days after the applicable Collateral Agents giving of notice of 
resignation or the Aggregate Required Interest Holders decision to remove 
such Collateral Agent, then such existing Collateral Agent
 
J-14
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
may, on behalf of the Secured Parties, appoint, pursuant to an agreement 
substantially in the form of Schedule 2 hereto, a successor Collateral 
Agent in such capacity, which successor Collateral Agent shall be a bank 
that has a combined capital and surplus of at least U.S.$500,000,000 (or 
its equivalent). Upon (i) the acceptance of its appointment as the 
Collateral Agent hereunder by a successor Collateral Agent, (ii) the 
execution of an agreement substantially in the form of Schedule 2 hereto, 
and (iii) only with respect to a successor Collateral Agent with respect to 
the Brazilian Collateral, the delegation of the powers granted under the 
power of attorney, by means of public deed, substantially in the form of 
(x) Schedule 3 hereto (in the case of an appointment by the Additional 
Lenders to such successor Collateral Agent, provided that such Additional 
Lender shall upon the delivery of its power of attorney to such successor 
Collateral Agent immediately revoke any power of attorney previously 
granted to the Collateral Agent being replaced), or (y) Schedule 6 hereto 
(in the case of an appointment by the Collateral Agent resigning or being 
removed to the successor Collateral Agent), such successor Collateral Agent 
shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, 
privileges and duties of such existing Collateral Agent in its capacity as 
such, and the existing Collateral Agent shall be discharged from its duties 
and obligations hereunder. After the Collateral Agents resignation or 
removal hereunder, the provisions of this Section 5.6 shall continue in 
effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be 
taken by it while it was acting as Collateral Agent.
 
5.7. Indemnification of the Collateral Agent.
 
Each Lender shall, based on its Pro Rata Share and to the extent not paid 
by the relevant Borrower, indemnify each Collateral Agent against any and 
all losses, liabilities, claims, obligations, damages or expenses 
(including the fees and disbursements of counsel) incurred by it arising 
out of or by reason of any investigation, litigation, arbitration or other 
proceeding (including any threatened investigation, arbitration or other 
proceeding) in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the 
Collateral Documents or any Financing Agreement to which it is a party or 
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (including the 
remuneration that the Obligors are obligated to pay to such Collateral 
Agent under Section 5.8 below) or the enforcement of any of the terms 
hereof or of any such other documents; provided that no Lender shall be 
liable to the Collateral Agent for any of the foregoing to the extent that 
it arises from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such 
Collateral Agent as determined by a final, nonappealable judgment by a 
court of competent jurisdiction, it being understood that no Lender will be 
liable to indemnify that Collateral Agent for any punitive or consequential 
damages in connection with this Agreement, the Collateral Documents or the 
Financing Agreement to which it is a party. The obligations of the Lenders 
under this Section 5.7 shall survive the termination of this Agreement, the 
repayment of the Obligations and/or the earlier resignation or removal of 
the Collateral Agent.
 
J-15
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
5.8. Remuneration.
 
Each Collateral Agent shall be entitled to such remuneration from the 
Obligors as it may agree from time to time with the Obligors and the 
Secured Parties, except that, following the occurrence of a Default that is 
continuing for at least thirty (30) days, such Collateral Agent may first 
seek remuneration from the Obligors and, in the event the Obligors do not 
provide such remuneration within a reasonable time period, such Collateral 
Agent may then seek remuneration from the Secured Parties, provided that no 
Secured Party will be liable to pay to such Collateral Agent any percentage 
of such remuneration pursuant to this Section 5.8 that exceeds such Secured 
Partys Pro Rata Share.
 
5.9. Action by the Collateral Agent.
 
The obligations of the Collateral Agents hereunder are only those expressly 
set forth herein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither 
Collateral Agent shall be required to take any action with respect to any 
Default, except as expressly provided herein.
 
5.10. Calculation of Liability.
 
The Pro Rata Share of each Secured Partys obligation to indemnify the 
Collateral Agents pursuant to Section 5.7 or to pay remuneration pursuant 
to Section 5.8 shall be calculated as of the date of first demand for 
payment by the applicable Collateral Agent pursuant to such Section.
 
SECTION 6. Decision making and consultation.
 
6.1. General.
 
No Secured Party shall exercise or enforce any right, including without 
limitation, enforcement against, foreclosure on or similar action with 
respect to the Collateral, give any consent or any waiver, agree to any 
amendment, or make any determination or notify any Obligor or any other 
Secured Party in respect of any provision of the Collateral Documents 
except in accordance with this Agreement. Without limiting the generality 
of the foregoing, neither Collateral Agent shall take any action or 
proceeding to enforce, foreclose on, or take similar action with respect 
to, the Collateral or to exercise its rights with respect to the 
Collateral, including the initiation of action in any court or before any 
administrative agency or governmental or arbitral tribunal to enforce such 
rights, except in accordance with this Agreement.
 
6.2. Information concerning Defaults and Default Actions.
 
In addition to and not in substitution for any notification requirements 
contained in this Agreement or any other Financing Agreement, the 
Administrative Agent, acting on behalf of the Lenders party to the EPF and 
Secured Loan Agreement, each Additional Administrative Agent, acting on 
behalf of the Lenders party to any Refinancing Agreement pursuant to which 
such Additional Administrative Agent is administrative agent and each 
Additional Bilateral Lender will notify the other Secured Parties, 
including the Collateral Agents, of the occurrence of any
 
J-16
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Default or Default Action of which such Administrative Agent, Additional 
Administrative Agent or Additional Bilateral Lender becomes aware as soon 
as reasonably practicable thereafter. Neither the Administrative Agent nor 
any Additional Administrative Agent nor any Additional Bilateral Lender 
shall incur any liability to any other party to this Agreement by reason of 
any failure by any party other than such Administrative Agent, such 
Additional Administrative Agent or such Additional Bilateral Lender, as the 
case may be, to give any notification required pursuant to this Section.
 
6.3. Amounts of Secured Party Debt.
 
The Collateral Agents shall be entitled to request from the Administrative 
Agent, acting on behalf of the Lenders party to the EPF and Secured Loan 
Agreement, from each Additional Administrative Agent, acting on behalf of 
the Lenders party to any Refinancing Agreement or from each Additional 
Bilateral Lender, at any time, with at least five Business Days prior 
written notice, confirmation as of the close of business on a specified 
date (a Calculation Date) of outstanding Obligations under each Financing 
Agreement outstanding as of such Calculation Date. The Administrative 
Agent, each Additional Administrative Agent and each Additional Bilateral 
Lender shall, not later than 11:00 a.m. New York City time on the Business 
Day that immediately follows the applicable Calculation Date, provide to 
the Collateral Agents such information, together with any other information 
with respect thereto that the Collateral Agent may reasonably request. The 
Collateral Agents shall be entitled conclusively to rely on information 
included in any such notice it receives pursuant to such a request in 
making calculations under this Agreement.
 
6.4. Meetings.
 
6.4.1. Meeting requisitions.
 
Each Collateral Agent, the Administrative Agent, acting on behalf of the 
Lenders party to the EPF and Secured Loan Agreement, each Additional 
Administrative Agent, acting on behalf of the Lenders party to any 
Refinancing Agreement, and any Additional Bilateral Lender may require at 
any time a meeting of the Secured Parties (or their representatives) in 
order to enable the Secured Parties to consult with each other as to:
 
(a) any Default which has occurred and the action to be taken with respect 
thereto (if any); and/or
 
(b) any potential or imminent Default or, any potential or imminent changes 
in law or circumstances or any other matter or thing which may affect the 
Obligors or the Collateral.
 
6.4.2. Time and place of meetings.
 
A meeting proposed by a Secured Party pursuant to Section 6.4.1 shall take 
place in accordance with the directions of the Aggregate Required Interest 
Holders and shall take place not less than ten (10) Business Days after a 
notice of a meeting is given pursuant to such Section 6.4.1.
 
J-17
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
6.5. Secured Party action following Default.
 
6.5.1. Notification of requirement to take decision.
 
If, at any time, an Administrative Agent, an Additional Administrative 
Agent or an Additional Bilateral Lender notifies either Collateral Agent, 
whether through notice given by an Administrative Agent, an Additional 
Administrative Agent or an Additional Bilateral Lender pursuant to Section 
6.4.1 hereof or otherwise, of an Event of Default or any other matter in 
respect of which it considers that a right of such Collateral Agent should 
be exercised or action should be taken, then such Collateral Agent shall 
promptly request instructions from the Aggregate Required Interest Holders 
(whether in conjunction with or without calling a meeting pursuant to 
Section 6.4.1) by delivering written notice to the Administrative Agent, 
acting on behalf of the Lenders party to the EPF and Secured Loan 
Agreement, and to each Additional Administrative Agent, acting on behalf of 
the Lenders party to any Refinancing Debt and to each Additional Bilateral 
Lender (a Notice Requesting Instruction):
 
(a) specifying, if relevant, the course of action such Collateral Agent 
proposes to take with respect to the matter in question;
 
(b) requesting each Secured Party then entitled to vote in connection with 
the relevant decision to give instructions to the Administrative Agent, to 
an Additional Administrative Agent or directly to such Collateral Agent 
pursuant to Section 6.5.2 as to how it wishes to cast the votes to which it 
is entitled in connection with the relevant decision to be made and, in the 
case of an Event of Default, requesting each Lender party to the EPF and 
Secured Loan Agreement to give instructions to the Administrative Agent or 
directly to such Collateral Agent and requesting each Additional Lender to 
give instructions to the relevant Additional Administrative Agent or 
directly to such Collateral Agent, in each case as to how such Lender 
wishes to cast the votes to which it is entitled as to whether or not such 
Collateral Agent should commence enforcement, foreclosure or similar action 
against the Collateral pursuant to the relevant Financing Agreement; and
 
(c) specifying the date by which the Aggregate Required Interest Holders 
must provide it with instructions in relation to such decision, which date 
must be not less than ten (10) Business Days after the date upon which such 
Collateral Agent gives such Notice Requesting Instruction or such lesser 
period as (i) such Collateral Agent, having consulted, to the extent 
practicable, with the Administrative Agent and each Additional 
Administrative Agent and each Additional Bilateral Lender, may consider 
necessary or advisable in circumstances where the interests of the Secured 
Parties or any of them would otherwise be likely to be prejudiced or (ii) 
such Collateral Agent may, in its absolute discretion, consider appropriate 
following due consideration of any request from the Secured Parties.
 
6.5.2. Voting returns to the Collateral Agent.
 
(a) The Administrative Agent, each Additional Administrative Agent and each 
Additional Bilateral Lender shall, not later than 11:00 a.m. New York City 
time on the date referred to in Section 6.5.1(c), provide to the relevant 
Collateral Agent a certificate setting out:
 
J-18
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
   (i) as of the close of business on the date of such Notice Requesting
   Instruction from such Collateral Agent distributed pursuant to Section
   6.5.1, (A) the aggregate amount of the outstanding commitments of the
   Lenders under the relevant Financing Agreement (or such Additional
   Bilateral Lenders commitment under the relevant Financing Agreement)
   and (B) the aggregate principal amount of the loans outstanding under
   such Financing Agreement; and
    
   (ii) the aggregate amount of Obligations represented by (A) the Secured
   Parties under the relevant Financing Agreement that have voted in favor
   of the proposed action, and (B) the Secured Parties under the relevant
   Financing Agreement who have voted against the proposed action; it being
   understood that if a Secured Party has not responded by 11:00 a.m. New
   York City time on the date referred to in Section 6.5.1(c) to the
   Collateral Agent (either directly or through its administrative agent),
   then such Secured Party shall be deemed to have voted against the
   proposed action.
    
6.6. Decisions binding on all parties.
 
Subject to Section 6.5.2 above, each decision of the Aggregate Required 
Interest Holders made under this Section 6 shall be binding on all parties 
to this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, if, in connection with an 
Event of Default and pursuant to Section 6.5.2, the Aggregate Required 
Interest Holders vote against instructing either Collateral Agent to 
enforce, foreclose on, or take similar action with respect to the 
Collateral, such Collateral Agent shall not take such action (and no 
Secured Party shall be entitled to request such Collateral Agent to take 
such action).
 
6.7. Restrictions on Secured Party action.
 
Save as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement and excluding in 
each case any Default Action taken pursuant to this Agreement and the 
Collateral Documents, each of the Secured Parties agrees that it does not 
have any right to, and that it will not, and that no other Person on its 
behalf or appointed by it (with the exception of the Collateral Agents 
acting in accordance with this Agreement) will:
 
(a) directly or indirectly take any action of any nature whatsoever against 
any Obligor under or in respect of the Collateral Documents, including but 
not limited to the commencement, continuance or voluntary joining in of any 
proceedings or process in any court or other competent forum in order to 
enforce compliance of any Borrower or any Obligor with the terms of any 
Collateral Document; or
 
(b) demand the payment of any amount owing to it (or to the Lenders of 
which it is the Administrative Agent, as the case may be) under any 
Collateral Document; or
 
(c) take any other action under any Collateral Document that would require 
payments by any Obligor of any amount under such Collateral Document in 
advance of any scheduled payment date; or
 
(d) enforce, foreclose on or take similar action with respect to any 
security interest created by or pursuant to any of the Collateral 
Documents, or exercise any rights or powers in

relation to enforcement of Collateral conferred by any Collateral 
Documents, unless such action is taken to preserve or protect (rather than 
to enforce) such security interest.
 
6.8. Enforcement of Default Action and Guarantors Guarantees.
 
For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement shall prevent: (a) 
any Secured Party from taking any Default Action pursuant to any Financing 
Agreement, and (b) any Secured Party, or the Administrative Agent or 
Additional Administrative Agent acting on behalf of such Secured Party, 
from enforcing any guarantee extended by a Guarantor in support of any 
Borrowers Obligations under any Financing Agreement; provided that, in the 
event any such Secured Party takes any of the foregoing actions pursuant to 
this Section 6.7(b), such Secured Party will notify the Collateral Agents 
and the other Secured Parties that it has taken such action, it being 
understood that the failure of such Secured Party to make such notification 
will not prejudice the right of such Secured Party from taking such action 
pursuant to this Section 6.7(b).
 
SECTION 7. Accession of Secured Parties.
 
7.1. Subsequently Issued Pari-Passu Refinancing Debt.
 
(a) Subject to Section 7.1(b), any Additional Administrative Agent and any 
Additional Bilateral Lender may, at any time and from time to time, deliver 
to the Collateral Agents an Accession Agreement, substantially in the form 
of Schedule 1 hereto executed by such Additional Administrative Agent or 
such Additional Bilateral Lender, whereby such Additional Administrative 
Agent or such Additional Bilateral Lender becomes a party to this Agreement 
as a Secured Party (in the case of any Additional Administrative Agent, for 
itself and on behalf of the Lenders party to any Refinancing Agreement 
pursuant to which any Additional Administrative Agent is administrative 
agent).
 
(b) Each Additional Bilateral Lender delivering an Accession Agreement 
pursuant to clause (a) above, or each Additional Lender on whose behalf an 
Accession Agreement was delivered by an Additional Administrative Agent 
pursuant to clause (a) above, shall deliver to the Brazil Collateral Agent 
a power of attorney in the form of Schedule 3 hereto, executed by such 
Additional Lender through a public deed, whereby such Additional Lender 
appoints, as its lawful attorney with respect to the Brazilian Collateral, 
the Brazil Collateral Agent; provided that, if any such Additional Lender 
elects to cause its Additional Administrative Agent or any other Person to 
deliver a power of attorney to the Brazil Collateral Agent pursuant to this 
Section 7.1(b), such Additional Lender agrees to deliver to such Person a 
power of attorney substantially in the form of Schedule 4, executed through 
a public deed. For the avoidance of doubt, any Person appointing the Brazil 
Collateral Agent as collateral agent with respect to the Brazilian 
Collateral upon instructions of an Additional Lender pursuant to the 
previous sentence shall deliver to the Brazil Collateral Agent a power of 
attorney substantially in the form of Schedule 3, executed through a public 
deed.
 
(c) An Additional Administrative Agent or an Additional Bilateral Lender 
under any Refinancing Agreement may only accede to and become party to this 
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(a) if no Default has occurred and is 
continuing.
 
J-20
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
(d) Upon such Accession Agreement becoming effective, such Refinancing 
Agreement shall be deemed to be a Financing Agreement hereunder, such 
additional lender under such Refinancing Agreement shall be deemed to be an 
Additional Lender for the purposes of this Agreement and any administrative 
agent, if any, under such Refinancing Agreement shall be deemed to be an 
Additional Administrative Agent.
 
7.2. Secured Party transfers.
 
(a) The Administrative Agent (on behalf of itself and each Lender party to 
the EPF and Secured Loan Agreement), each Additional Administrative Agent 
(on behalf of itself and each Lender party to the Financing Agreement 
pursuant to which such Additional Administrative Agent is administrative 
agent) and each Additional Bilateral Lender undertakes that it shall not 
transfer or assign any of its rights or obligations under any Financing 
Agreement to which it is party other than to a Person that, prior to or 
simultaneously with such transfer is bound by the terms of this Agreement 
or so becomes by executing and delivering to the Administrative Agent, each 
Additional Administrative Agent and each Additional Bilateral Lender, as 
the case may be, an Accession Agreement in the form of Schedule 1.
 
(b) For the avoidance of doubt, each transfer pursuant to Section 7.2 shall 
be subject to the terms of the relevant Financing Agreement.
 
SECTION 8. Miscellaneous.
 
8.1. Addresses for notices. All notices, directions, instructions and other 
communications provided for herein shall be in writing and shall be given 
to the respective parties hereto at the addresses provided for notices in 
each Financing Document or the relevant Accession Agreement, as the case

notice to the other parties hereto.
 
8.2. Entire agreement. This Agreement and each Accession Agreement 
represent the entire agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the 
subject matter hereof and thereof and, except as otherwise provided, this 
Agreement may not be altered, amended, modified or terminated except in a 
writing executed pursuant to Section 8.10.
 
8.3. Remedies and waivers. The remedies provided in this Agreement are 
cumulative and not exclusive of any other remedies provided by Applicable 
Law.
 
8.4. Severability. The illegality or unenforceability in any jurisdiction 
of any provision hereof or of any document required hereunder shall not in 
any way affect or impair the legality or enforceability of the remaining 
provisions of this Agreement or such other document in such jurisdiction or 
such provision in any other jurisdiction.
 
8.5. Prevailing provisions. If there is any conflict between the provisions 
of any Financing Agreement and the Collateral Documents on the one hand, 
and this Agreement, on the other hand, in relation to when payments shall 
or may be made or action that shall or may be taken, in each case with 
respect to the Collateral or the Collateral Documents, the provisions of 
this Agreement shall prevail.
 
J-21
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
8.6. Obligations binding inter se. The obligations of the parties that have 
executed this Agreement shall not be affected by the fact that not all of 
the parties hereto have validly executed this Agreement and such 
obligations shall be binding inter se.
 
8.7. No Lien. The parties hereto confirm that this Agreement shall not 
constitute nor create nor is it intended to constitute or create any Lien 
on the part of the Secured Parties.
 
8.8. Interest on overdue sums. Each amount payable by any of the Secured 
Parties to the Collateral Agent which is not paid when due and payable, 
shall carry interest until paid (as well before as after judgment) payable 
on demand at a rate of interest as would equal the cost to the Collateral 
Agent of borrowing such amount as determined by the Collateral Agent.
 
8.9. Successors and assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure 
to the benefit of each of the parties and their respective successors and 
assigns, whether so expressed or not, and, in particular, shall inure to 
the benefit of and be enforceable by any future holder or holders of any 
Obligations, and any Secured Party shall include any such subsequent holder 
of Obligations, wherever the context permits.
 
8.10. Amendments; Etc. Subject to the exceptions below, no amendment or 
waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be effective unless the 
same shall be in writing and signed by the Aggregate Required Interest 
Holders (or by the Administrative Agent or an Additional Administrative 
Agent acting with the consent of such Aggregate Required Interest Holders); 
provided, that: (A) any such waiver or amendment shall be effective only in 
the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given, unless 
the Aggregate Required Interest Holders otherwise agree, (B) no such 
amendment or waiver shall, unless signed by all of the Secured Parties or 
by the Administrative Agent or an Additional Administrative Agent acting 
with the consent of the Secured Parties represented by it, modify the 
definition of the term Aggregate Required Interest Holders, or modify any 
provision of Section 3, Section 4, Section 6.5.1 or of this Section 8.10 
and (C) any modification hereof with respect to the rights and obligations 
of the Collateral Agent shall require the consent of such Collateral Agent. 
No delay on the part of any party in the exercise of any right, power or 
remedy shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial 
waiver by such party of any right, power or remedy preclude any further 
exercise thereof, or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy.
 
8.11. In order to ensure the perfection and effectiveness of the 
Collateral, the parties hereto agree that this Agreement and any Accession 
Agreement, in the form of the Schedule 1 hereto, shall be annotated before

Each of the parties hereto (other than the Collateral Agent and the 
Administrative Agent) hereby irrevocably appoints National Corporate 
Research Ltd. (the Process Agent), with an office on the date hereof at 
10 East 40th Street, 10th Floor, New York, New York 10016 as its agent and

to give any notice of any such service of process to it shall not impair or 
affect the validity of such service or, to the extent permitted by 
applicable law, the enforcement of any judgment based thereon. Such 
appointment shall be irrevocable until the final payment of all amounts 
payable under this Agreement, except that if for any reason the Process 
Agent appointed hereby ceases to be able to act as such, then such party 
(as applicable) shall, by an instrument reasonably satisfactory to the 
Administrative Agent, appoint another Person in the Borough of Manhattan as

including the execution and filing of any and all documents, that may be 
necessary to continue the designation of the Process Agent pursuant to this

proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient

VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVES ITS RIGHTS TO A TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY

DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY, IN ANY ACTION, 
LITIGATION OR OTHER PROCEEDING OF ANY TYPE BROUGHT BY ANY OF THE PARTIES

AGREES THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE TRIED IN A COURT 
TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, THE PARTIES FURTHER 
AGREE THAT THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IS WAIVED BY OPERATION

HERETO TO THIS PROVISION IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT FOR EACH OF THE OTHER 
PARTIES HERETO TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT.

Credit Agreement, and (ii) registration of the mortgage in favor of BANCO

buildings, machinery and equipment installed and in operation therein as a 
collateral to Agreement No. 06.2.1060.1 executed with that institution on 
November 26, 2006, are totally fulfilled, so that the security interest 
created under the Mortgage Deed and Other Covenants shall be considered 
irrevocable and irretrievable and remain indivisible and enforceable until 
final and total payment of the obligations resulting from the Credit 
Agreement.
 
11) Aracruz Celulose undertakes to provide the georeferencing of the 
mortgaged real property within the maximum period set forth on the

enrollment certificate of registration of ownership of the property that 
already contain an annotation of the new description in order to evidence 
compliance with the above-mentioned georeferencing obligation. In the event 
of enforcement of the mortgage, in observance to the good faith principle, 
Aracruz Celulose undertakes to perform all required acts and measures in 
regard to georeferencing in order to permit the registration acts in 
relation to adjudication or disposal of the real estate properties in their 
applicable Real Estate Registry Office. Aracruz Celulose, hereby, grants 
the necessary powers, even if not specified herein, to the Collateral 
Agent, if the enforcement of the mortgage takes place and provided that 
there is no compliance with the georeferencing obligation established 
herein, to take all necessary measures with the applicable bodies to 
promote the realization of the georeferencing of the real estate properties 
and the Collateral Agent is entitled, therefore, to sign any and all 
documents. In this situation, the expenditure

Aracruz Celulose.
 
12) In case there is any imperfection in the real estate properties 
mortgaged description, the parties have requested and hereby expressly 
agreed to authorize the respective real estate registries that any such 
event shall be superseded by the characteristics, descriptions and 
confrontations contained in the corresponding records, in order to comply 
with the registry principle of objective specialty, as provided for in 
Federal Law No. 6.015/1973, Articles 176 et seq., so that there shall be no 
need for another amendment and ratification of the Mortgage Deed and Other 
Covenants for such reason.
 
13) Because the industrial complex (hereinafter referred to as the 
Industrial Complex) and Barra do Riacho Plants described in details and

operates, with recognized insurance companies, and to cause the Collateral 
Agent, on behalf of the Lenders, to become, and shall at all times maintain 
the Collateral Agent as, an additional insured under each insurance policy 
covering the Industrial Complex or the Barra do Riacho Plants.
 
14) In case of total or partial expropriation by any Governmental Authority 
of the mortgaged real estate properties, the rights of Lenders under this 
mortgage shall be subrogated in the price that may be paid by the 
Expropriating Authority, to the extent that such expropriation results in 
an Event of Default under Section 9.1(a) of the Credit Agreement, or to the 
extent that such expropriation results in an automatic acceleration event 
under Section 9.1(e), (f) or (g) of the Credit Agreement or upon the 
occurrence of any other Event of Default to the extent that the 
Administrative Agent (upon request of the Majority Lenders) declares the 
acceleration of all amounts due thereunder, which shall be evidenced by

over any of the real estate properties mortgaged under the Mortgage Deed 
and Other Covenants, without the Collateral Agents, acting on behalf of

Covenants due and payable, as provided for in the Sole Paragraph of Article

------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
of the Lenders shall take all actions required by law or that Aracruz 
Celulose or Mucuri Florestal may reasonably request in order to properly 
release such security interest, including any filings with the relevant 
registries in Brazil, provided that any costs or expenses in connection 
therewith shall be borne by Aracruz Celulose and/or Mucuri Florestal, as 
applicable.
 
8) In addition to the provisions of item 7 above, the Lenders may, at any 
time, accelerate the maturity of the debt as provided in the Credit 
Agreement. In case Aracruz Trading fails to pay any amounts that shall be 
paid to the Lenders under the Credit Agreement, or in case any other Event 
of Default under Section 9.1(a) of the Credit Agreement occurs and is 
continuing (and is not properly remedied within any cure periods set forth 
in the Credit Agreement), or to the extent that an automatic acceleration 
event occurs under Section 9.1(e), (f) or (g) of the Credit Agreement or 
upon the occurrence of any other Event of Default to the extent that the 
Administrative Agent (upon request of the Majority Lenders) declares the 
acceleration of all amounts due thereunder, which shall be evidenced by 
means of a written notice sent to the Collateral Agent (together with copy 
of the notice sent by the Administrative Agent, as required pursuant to 
Section 9.1 of the Credit Agreement), the Collateral Agent may, on behalf 
of the Lenders, execute the rights under this deed regardless of the 
acceleration of the maturity of the debt.
 
9) Environmental Liability: Each of Aracruz Celulose and Mucuri Florestal 
states that: (i) each of the mortgaged real estate properties and the 
respective businesses and operations conducted therein are in compliance 
with and have no liability under any applicable Environmental Law; (ii) 
each of the owners of the mortgaged real estate properties has obtained all 
Environmental Permits required for the conduct of their businesses, 
operations and the use of such mortgaged real estate properties in 
accordance with the Environmental Laws, and all such Environmental Permits 
are valid and in good standing; and (iii) except as described in the Credit 
Agreement, there is no Environmental Claim pending or threatened relating 
to any of the mortgaged real estate properties, and there are no actions, 
activities, circumstances, conditions, events or incidents that could give 
grounds for such an Environmental Claim.
 
10) The parties confirm hereby that the resolutory conditions provided for 
in the Mortgage Deed and Other Covenants, namely: (i) the execution of the 
Credit Agreement, and (ii) registration of the mortgage in favor of BANCO 
NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO ECONÔMICO E SOCIAL - BNDES over the real estate 
property in the City of Guaíba, State of Rio Grande do Sul, where the 
industrial facilities of Aracruz Celulose are located, including the land, 
buildings, machinery and equipment installed and in operation therein as a 
collateral to Agreement No. 06.2.1060.1 executed with that institution on 
November 26, 2006, are totally fulfilled, so that the security interest 
created under the Mortgage Deed and Other Covenants shall be considered 
irrevocable and irretrievable and remain indivisible and enforceable until 
final and total payment of the obligations resulting from the Credit 
Agreement.
 
K-5
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
11) After the end of the term of effectiveness of the agricultural pledge 
created under the Mortgage Deed and Other Covenants, Aracruz Celulose 
irrevocably, irretrievably and unconditionally undertakes to keep all 
eucalyptus wood pending crops or crops under formation for the production 
of wood pulp cellulose planted in the real estate properties mortgaged by 
it free and clear from any liens, encumbrances or restrictions of whatever 
nature except for the Permitted Liens and any sale, transfer, use or 
disposition permitted under the Credit Agreement and under the Mortgage 
Deed and Other Covenants.
 
12) Aracruz Celulose undertakes to provide the georeferencing of the 
mortgaged real property within the maximum period set forth on the 
applicable legislation which governs this procedure. Furthermore, Aracruz 
Celulose also agrees to present to the Collateral Agent, always up to the 
last business day of [May / June - as the date of the execution of the 
Amendment and Ratification of Mortgage and Other Covenants] a survey of 
georeferenced areas as well as its respective procedures that have already 
been enrolled with the National Institute of Colonization and Agrarian 
Reform -INCRA so as to obtain their certification or, when applicable, the 
enrollment certificate of registration of ownership of the property that 
already contain an annotation of the new description in order to evidence 
compliance with the above-mentioned georeferencing obligation. In the event 
of enforcement of the mortgage, in observance to the good faith principle, 
Aracruz Celulose undertakes to perform all required acts and measures in 
regard to georeferencing in order to permit the registration acts in 
relation to adjudication or disposal of the real estate properties in their 
applicable Real Estate Registry Office. Aracruz Celulose, hereby, grants 
the necessary powers, even if not specified herein, to the Collateral 
Agent, if the enforcement of the mortgage takes place and provided that 
there is no compliance with the georeferencing obligation established 
herein, to take all necessary measures with the applicable bodies to 
promote the realization of the georeferencing of the real estate properties 
and the Collateral Agent is entitled, therefore, to sign any and all 
documents. In this situation, the expenditure undertaken in connection to 
such arrangements should be fully disbursed by Aracruz Celulose.
 
13) By virtue of the large number of real estate properties mortgaged under 
the Mortgage Deed and Other Covenants, in case there is any imperfection in 
their description, the parties have requested and hereby expressly agreed 
to authorize the respective real estate registries that any such event 
shall be superseded by the characteristics, descriptions and confrontations 
contained in the corresponding records, in order to comply with the 
registry principle of objective specialty, as provided for in Federal Law 
No. 6.015/1973, Articles 176 et seq., so that there shall be no need for 
another amendment and ratification of the Mortgage Deed and Other Covenants 
for such reason.
 
14) Aracruz Celulose undertakes to maintain insurance coverage for the 
pending crops, or crops in process of formation of eucalyptus wood planted 
in the real estate properties object of the agricultural pledge according 
to the Mortgage Deed and Other Covenants against fire and risks, as 
customary in the business in which Aracruz operates, with
 
K-6
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
recognized insurance companies, and to cause the Collateral Agent, on 
behalf of the Lenders, to become, and shall at all times maintain the 
Collateral Agent as, an additional insured under each insurance policy 
covering the real estate properties object of the agricultural pledge.
 
15) In case of total or partial expropriation by any Governmental Authority 
of the mortgaged real estate properties, the rights of Lenders under this 
mortgage shall be subrogated in the price that may be paid by the 
Expropriating Authority, to the extent that such expropriation results in 
an Event of Default under Section 9.1(a) of the Credit Agreement, or to the 
extent that such expropriation results in an automatic acceleration event 
under Section 9.1(e), (f) or (g) of the Credit Agreement or upon the 
occurrence of any other Event of Default to the extent that the 
Administrative Agent (upon request of the Majority Lenders) declares the 
acceleration of all amounts due thereunder, which shall be evidenced by 
means of a written notice sent to the Collateral Agent (together with copy 
of the notice sent by the Administrative Agent, as required pursuant to 
Section 9.1 of the Credit Agreement), being the Lenders and Collateral 
Agent herein and hereby vested with irrevocable and irretrievable powers to 
receive such proceeds, unless otherwise provided in the Credit Agreement 
without prejudice of other rights and prerogatives granted to them in this 
deed, the Mortgage Deed and Other Covenants and shall apply such proceeds 
in the form set forth in the Credit Agreement. Lenders and Collateral Agent 
may, further, practice all actions required to full performance of the 
power of attorney granted to them in this provision, including substitute, 
in whole or in part, the powers herein granted to them.
 
16) That Aracruz Celulose undertakes to: (a) pay, when due, all taxes, fees 
and any charges with their respective fines currently levied or which may 
be levied in the future on the mortgaged real estate properties and 
accessories, either by virtue of new laws or interpretation of existing 
ones, showing, when requested, evidence of each payment to Lenders or the 
Collateral Agent; (b) timely pay the premiums due in relation to the 
insurance of the real estate properties object of the agricultural pledge, 
presenting to Lenders and the Collateral Agent evidence thereof within five 
(05) days after the deadline for payment of the premium of the respective 
policies (but always before the expiration of their term of validity); (c) 
maintain integral the guarantee herein created, taking all steps required 
to the due conservation and maintenance of the mortgaged real estate 
properties; (d) within twenty (20) Business Days as of the date of

Subordinated Loan, that the Subordinated Loan is expressly subordinate and 
junior in right of payment (as that phrase is defined in Section 3.1(b) 
below) to all Senior Debt Obligations.
 
(b) Subordinate and junior in right of payment means that no part of the 
Subordinated Loan shall have any claim to the assets of the Borrower or any 
of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates on a parity with or prior to the claim of 
the Senior Debt Obligations.
 
(c) The credit held by the Shareholder Lender under this Agreement is 
considered, for all legal purposes, a subordinated credit (crédito 
subordinado) against the Borrower, pursuant to the terms of article 83, 
item VIII, letter a, of Law No. 11,101, of February 9, 2005 (the

the Administrative Agent, acting at the direction of the Majority Lenders, 
the Shareholder Lender shall not take, demand or receive from the Borrower

shall cause its Subsidiaries and Affiliates not to, make, give or permit 
any payment of (of whatever kind or nature, whether in cash, property, 
securities or otherwise) or in respect of the Subordinated Loan; provided, 
however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision hereof, 
the Borrower may, at any time, make payments of PIK Interest in accordance 
with Section 2.2 above; provided further, that, notwithstanding any other 
provision of this Agreement, if and to the extent such payment is not 
prohibited under Section 8.22 of the Senior Credit Agreement (or any 
successor provision), the Borrower may, without premium or penalty, redeem, 
purchase, pay or repay any principal or accrued interest under the 
Subordinated Loan, upon at least three Business Days notice to the 
Shareholder Lender.
 
O-3
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
(e) The expressions prior payment in full, payment in full, paid in 
full and any other similar terms or phrases when used herein with respect 
to the Senior Debt Obligations shall mean the payment in full, in 
immediately available funds, of all of the Senior Debt Obligations (other 
than contingent obligations (including contingent obligations of 
indemnification) for which no claim has been asserted (and otherwise not 
satisfied) that survives termination of the Senior Credit Agreement) in 
accordance with the terms of the Senior Credit Agreement.
 
(f) Prior to the Release Date, neither the Borrower nor the Shareholder 
Lender shall (i) without the prior written consent of the Administrative 
Agent, acting at the direction of the Majority Lenders, amend, modify or 
supplement any provision of this Agreement in a manner that increases the 
rate of interest payable on, or otherwise alters the formulation of any 
interest rate applicable to, the Subordinated Loan to a rate greater than 
the applicable market rate as of the date hereof, increases the amount of 
any fees or other amounts due hereunder, or accelerates the time for 
payment of any principal, interest, fees, or other amounts due hereunder, 
or (ii) exercise any right, power, privilege (other than any right, power 
or privilege expressly granted to any Shareholder Lender under this 
Agreement or other related documents) or any remedy hereunder (including 
acceleration) or at law or in equity, in respect of the Subordinated Loan.
 
(g) The Shareholder Lender and the Borrower agree that, upon the occurrence 
of any of the Events of Default described in Section 5.1(c) or Section 
5.1(d) of this Agreement (each such event, a Proceeding):
 
   (i) all Senior Debt Obligations shall be paid in full before any payment
   or distribution of whatever kind or nature is made with respect to the
   Subordinated Loan; and
    
   (ii) any payment or distribution of assets of the Borrower, whether in
   cash, property or securities, to which the Shareholder Lender would be
   entitled in respect of the Subordinated Loan shall be paid or delivered
   by the Borrower, or any receiver, trustee in bankruptcy, liquidating
   trustee, disbursing agent or other Person making such payment or
   distribution, directly to the Administrative Agent, to the extent
   necessary to pay in full all Senior Debt Obligations, before any payment
   or distribution of any kind or nature shall be made to the Shareholder
   Lender in respect of the Subordinated Loan.
    
(h) If any payment or distribution, whether consisting of money, property 
or securities, shall be collected or received by the Shareholder Lender in 
respect of the Subordinated Loan, except payments permitted to be made 
pursuant to Section 3.1(c) above, the Shareholder Lender shall, as soon as 
practicable, deliver the same to the Administrative Agent in U.S. Dollars, 
duly indorsed to the Administrative Agent, if required, to be applied to 
the payment or prepayment of the Senior Debt Obligations until the Senior 
Debt Obligations are paid in full. Until so delivered, funds in the amount 
of such payment or distribution shall be held in trust by the Shareholder 
Lender as the property of the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the 
Senior Lenders, segregated from other funds and property held by the 
Shareholder Lender.
 
(i) In furtherance of the subordination, the Shareholder Lender further 
agrees that, if any Proceeding is commenced by or against the Borrower, the 
Administrative Agent (on behalf of the Senior Lenders) is hereby 
irrevocably authorized and empowered (in its own name or in
 
O-4
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
the name of the Shareholder Lender or the Administrative Agent or 
otherwise), but shall have no obligation, to demand, sue for, collect and 
receive every payment or distribution of any kind (whether in cash, 
property or securities) that otherwise would be payable or deliverable upon 
or with respect to the Subordinated Loan in any Proceeding (including any 
payment that may be payable by any reason of any other indebtedness of the 
Borrower being subordinated to payment of the Subordinated Loan) and give 
acquittance therefor and to file claims and proofs of claim and take such 
other action (including, without limitation, voting the Subordinated Loan 
or enforcing any security interest or other lien securing payment of the 
Subordinated Loan) as it may deem necessary or advisable for the exercise 
or enforcement of any of the rights or interests of the Senior Lenders or 
Administrative Agent hereunder and the Shareholder Lender or Administrative 
Agent shall duly and promptly take such action as any of the Senior Lenders 
may reasonably request to the extent permitted by Applicable Law to collect 
the Subordinated Loan for the account of the Senior Lenders and 
Administrative Agent and to file appropriate claims or proofs of claim in 
respect of the Subordinated Loan, to execute and deliver to the 
Administrative Agent, on behalf of the Senior Lenders, such powers of 
attorney, assignments, or other instruments as the Senior Lenders or 
Administrative Agent may reasonably request and that are required in order 
to enable the Administrative Agent (on behalf of the Senior Lenders) to 
enforce any and all claims with respect to, and to collect and receive any 
and all payments or distributions which may be payable or deliverable upon 
or with respect to the Subordinated Loan.
 
(j) The Administrative Agent is hereby authorized to demand specific 
performance of this Agreement at the request of the Majority Lenders, in 
each case at any time that either the Borrower or the Shareholder Lender 
shall have failed to comply with any of the provisions hereof applicable to 
it. The Shareholder Lender hereby irrevocably waives any defense based on 
the adequacy of the remedy at law, which might be asserted as a bar to such 
remedy of specific performance.
 
(k) The Shareholder Lender further agrees that the Subordinated Loan shall 
also be subordinated in the right of payment to the Senior Debt 
Obligations, to the extent and in the manner set forth in the Subordination 
Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit A, which is being executed and 
delivered by the parties hereto simultaneous to the execution and as a 
condition to the effectiveness of this Agreement.
 
(l) On or prior to the date hereof and as a condition to the effectiveness 
of this Agreement, the Shareholder Lender has delivered to the 
Administrative Agent (for distribution to the Lenders) a legal opinion of 
special Brazilian counsel and special New York counsel to the Shareholder 
Lender customary in form and substance and with qualifications and 
assumptions customary for an opinion rendered in the international 
financing markets confirming that this Agreement and the Subordination 
Agreement represent valid, binding and enforceable obligations of the 
Shareholder Lender under the law of Brazil and the law of the State of New 
York, respectively.
 
Section 3.2 Rights of Subrogation. The Shareholder Lender agrees that no 
payment or distribution to the Senior Lenders pursuant to the provisions of 
this Agreement shall entitle the Shareholder Lender to exercise any right 
of subrogation in respect thereof until the Senior Debt Obligations shall 
have been paid in full. Upon payment in full of the Senior Debt 
Obligations,
 
O-5
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
the Shareholder Lender shall be subrogated to the rights of the Senior 
Lenders with respect to any payment or distribution by or on behalf of the 
Shareholder Lender to the Senior Lenders pursuant to the terms hereof to 
the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law.

Section 2.1 Subordination.
 
(a) Each of the Shareholder Lender and the Borrower agrees, for itself, 
and, in the case of the Shareholder Lender, for each future holder of the 
Subordinated Loan, that the Subordinated Loan is expressly subordinate and 
junior in right of payment (as that phrase is defined in Section 2.1(b) 
below) to all Senior Debt Obligations.
 
(b) Subordinate and junior in right of payment means that no part of the 
Subordinated Loan shall have any claim to the assets of the Borrower or any 
of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates on a parity with or prior to the claim of 
the Senior Debt Obligations.
 
(c) Prior to the Release Date, without the express prior written consent of 
the Administrative Agent, acting at the direction of the Majority Lenders, 
the Shareholder Lender shall not take, demand or receive from the Borrower 
or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, and the Borrower shall not, and 
shall cause its Subsidiaries and Affiliates not to, make, give or permit 
any payment of (of whatever kind or nature, whether in cash, property, 
securities or otherwise) or in respect of the Subordinated Loan; provided, 
however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision hereof, 
the Borrower may, at any time, make payments of PIK Interest in accordance 
with Section 2.2 of the Shareholder Loan Agreement; provided further, 
that, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if and to the 
extent such payment is not prohibited under Section 8.22 of the Senior 
Credit Agreement (or any successor provision), the Borrower may, without 
premium or penalty, redeem, purchase, pay or repay any principal or accrued 
interest under the Subordinated Loan, upon at least three Business Days 
notice to the Shareholder Lender.
 
(d) The expressions prior payment in full, payment in full, paid in 
full and any other similar terms or phrases when used herein with respect 
to the Senior Debt Obligations shall mean the payment in full, in 
immediately available funds, of all of the Senior Debt Obligations (other 
than contingent obligations (including contingent obligations of 
indemnification) for which no claim has been asserted (and otherwise not 
satisfied) that survives termination of the Senior Credit Agreement) in 
accordance with the terms of the Senior Credit Agreement.
 
(e) Prior to the Release Date, neither the Borrower nor the Shareholder 
Lender shall (i) without the prior written consent of the Administrative 
Agent, acting at the direction of the Majority Lenders, amend, modify or 
supplement any provision of the Shareholder Loan Agreement in a manner that 
increases the rate of interest payable on, or otherwise alters the 
formulation of any interest rate applicable to, the Subordinated Loan to a 
rate greater than the applicable market rate as of the date hereof, 
increases the amount of any fees or other amounts due under the Shareholder 
Loan Agreement, or accelerates the time for payment of any principal, 
interest, fees, or other amounts due under the Shareholder Loan Agreement, 
or (ii) exercise any
 
A-4
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
right, power, privilege (other than any right, power or privilege expressly 
granted to any Shareholder Lender under this Agreement, the Shareholder 
Loan Agreement or other related documents) or any remedy hereunder or 
thereunder (including acceleration) or at law or in equity, in respect of 
the Subordinated Loan.
 
(f) The Shareholder Lender and the Borrower agree that, upon the occurrence 
of any Proceeding:
 
   (i) all Senior Debt Obligations shall be paid in full before any payment
   or distribution of whatever kind or nature is made with respect to the
   Subordinated Loan; and
    
   (ii) any payment or distribution of assets of the Borrower, whether in
   cash, property or securities, to which the Shareholder Lender would be
   entitled in respect of the Subordinated Loan shall be paid or delivered
   by the Borrower, or any receiver, trustee in bankruptcy, liquidating
   trustee, disbursing agent or other Person making such payment or
   distribution, directly to the Administrative Agent, to the extent
   necessary to pay in full all Senior Debt Obligations, before any payment
   or distribution of any kind or nature shall be made to the Shareholder
   Lender in respect of the Subordinated Loan.
    
(g) If any payment or distribution, whether consisting of money, property 
or securities, shall be collected or received by the Shareholder Lender in 
respect of the Subordinated Loan, except payments permitted to be made 
pursuant to Section 2.1(c) above, the Shareholder Lender shall, as soon as 
practicable, deliver the same to the Administrative Agent, in U.S. Dollars, 
duly indorsed to the Administrative Agent, if required, to be applied to 
the payment or prepayment of the Senior Debt Obligations until the Senior 
Debt Obligations are paid in full. Until so delivered, funds in the amount 
of such payment or distribution shall be held in trust by the Shareholder 
Lender as the property of the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the 
Senior Lenders, segregated from other funds and property held by the 
Shareholder Lender.
 
(h) In furtherance of the subordination, the Shareholder Lender further 
agrees that, if any Proceeding is commenced by or against the Borrower, the 
Administrative Agent (on behalf of the Senior Lenders) is hereby 
irrevocably authorized and empowered (in its own name or in the name of the 
Shareholder Lender or the Administrative Agent or otherwise), but shall 
have no obligation, to demand, sue for, collect and receive every payment 
or distribution of any kind (whether in cash, property or securities) that 
otherwise would be payable or deliverable upon or with respect to the 
Subordinated Loan in any Proceeding (including any payment that may be 
payable by any reason of any other indebtedness of the Borrower being 
subordinated to payment of the Subordinated Loan) and give acquittance 
therefor and to file claims and proofs of claim and take such other action 
(including, without limitation, voting the Subordinated Loan or enforcing 
any security interest or other lien securing payment of the Subordinated 
Loan) as it may deem necessary or advisable for the exercise or enforcement 
of any of the rights or interests of the Senior Lenders or Administrative 
Agent hereunder and the Shareholder Lender or Administrative Agent shall 
duly and promptly take such action as any of the Senior Lenders may 
reasonably request to the extent permitted by Applicable Law to collect the 
Subordinated Loan for the account of the Senior Lenders and Administrative 
Agent and to file appropriate claims or proofs of claim in respect of the 
Subordinated Loan, to execute and deliver to the Administrative
 
A-5
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Agent, on behalf of the Senior Lenders, such powers of attorney, 
assignments, or other instruments as the Senior Lenders or Administrative 
Agent may reasonably request and that are required in order to enable the 
Administrative Agent (on behalf of the Senior Lenders) to enforce any and 
all claims with respect to, and to collect and receive any and all payments 
or distributions which may be payable or deliverable upon or with respect 
to the Subordinated Loan.
 
(i) The Administrative Agent is hereby authorized to demand specific 
performance of this Agreement and the Shareholder Loan Agreement at the 
request of the Majority Lenders, in each case at any time that either the 
Borrower or the Shareholder Lender shall have failed to comply with any of 
the provisions of this Agreement or the Shareholder Loan Agreement 
applicable to it. The Shareholder Lender hereby irrevocably waives any 
defense based on the adequacy of the remedy at law, which might be asserted 
as a bar to such remedy of specific performance.
 
Section 2.2 Rights of Subrogation. The Shareholder Lender agrees that no 
payment or distribution to the Senior Lenders pursuant to the provisions of 
this Agreement or the Shareholder Loan Agreement shall entitle the 
Shareholder Lender to exercise any right of subrogation in respect thereof 
until the Senior Debt Obligations shall have been paid in full. Upon 
payment in full of the Senior Debt Obligations, the Shareholder Lender 
shall be subrogated to the rights of the Senior Lenders with respect to any 
payment or distribution by or on behalf of the Shareholder Lender to the 
Senior Lenders pursuant to the terms hereof to the fullest extent permitted 
by Applicable Law.

ARTICLE IV
GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION
 
Section 4.1 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and 
construed in accordance with, the law of New York, without giving effect to 
any conflict of laws principles that would require the application of the 
laws of another jurisdiction.
 
Section 4.2 Jurisdiction, Service of Process and Venue. Any legal action or 
proceeding by or against any party hereto or with respect to or arising out 
of this Agreement may be brought in or removed to the courts of the State 
of New York, in and for the County of New York, or for the United States of 
America for the Southern District of New York (in each case sitting in the 
Borough of Manhattan). By execution and delivery of this Agreement, each 
party accepts, for itself and in respect of its property, generally and 
unconditionally, the jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts (and courts of 
appeal therefrom) for legal proceedings arising out of or in connection 
with this Agreement, which jurisdiction shall be exclusive in the case of 
any legal action or proceeding by the Borrower or the Shareholder Lender. 
Each of the Borrower and the Shareholder Lender irrevocably consents to the 
appointment of the Process Agent as its agent to receive service of process 
(this Agreement and any other related agreements to which it is a party) in 
New York, New York.
 
Each of the Borrower and the Shareholder Lender hereby irrevocably appoints 
National Corporate Research Ltd. (the Process Agent), with an office on 
the date hereof at 10 East 40th Street, 10th Floor, New York, New York 
10016, as its agent and true and lawful attorney-in-fact in its name, place 
and stead to accept on its behalf service of copies of the summons and 
complaint and any other process that may be served in any such suit, action 
or proceeding brought in the State of New York, and agrees that the failure 
of the Process Agent to give any notice of any such service of process to 
it shall not impair or affect the validity of such service or, to the 
extent permitted by Applicable Law, the enforcement of any judgment based 
thereon. Such appointment shall be irrevocable until the final payment of 
all amounts payable under this Agreement, except that if for any reason the 
Process Agent appointed hereby ceases to be able to act as such, then the 
Borrower and the Shareholder Lender shall each, by an instrument reasonably 
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, appoint another Person in the 
Borough of Manhattan as such Process Agent subject to the approval (which 
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) of the Administrative Agent. 
Each of the Borrower and the Shareholder Lender covenants and agrees that 
it shall take any and all reasonable action, including the execution and 
filing of any and all documents, that may be necessary to continue the 
designation of the Process Agent pursuant to this paragraph in full force 
and effect and to cause the Process Agent to act as such.
 
Nothing herein shall in any way be deemed to limit the ability of the 
Shareholder Lender to serve any process or summons in any manner permitted 
by Applicable Law or to obtain jurisdiction over any Person in such other 
jurisdictions, including but not limited to Brazil, and in such manner, as 
may be permitted by Applicable Law.

or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any suit, action or 
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought in or

hereby further irrevocably waives any claim that any such suit, action or 
proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient 
forum. A final judgment (in respect of which time for all appeals has 
elapsed) in any such suit, action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may 
be enforced by suit upon judgment in any court in any jurisdiction to which 
the applicable Person is or may be subject.

voluntarily and intentionally waives its rights to a trial by jury of any 
claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of or related to the loan 
documents or the transactions contemplated thereby, in any action, 
litigation or other proceeding of any type brought by any of the parties 
against any other party or any other person, whether with respect to 
contract claims, tort claims or otherwise. Each of the parties hereto 
agrees that any such claim or cause of action shall be tried in a court 
trial without a jury. Without limiting the foregoing, the parties further 
agree that their respective right to a trial by jury is waived by operation 
of this section as to any action, counterclaim or other proceeding that 
seeks, in whole or in part, to challenge the validity or enforceability of 
the loan documents or any provision thereof. The agreement of each party 
hereto to this provision is a material inducement for each of the other 
parties hereto to enter into this Agreement.
 
Section 4.4 Waiver of Immunity. To the extent that the Borrower may be or 
become entitled to claim for itself or its Property any immunity on the 
ground of sovereignty or the like from suit, court jurisdiction, attachment 
before judgment, attachment in aid of execution of a judgment or execution 
of a judgment, and to the extent that in any such jurisdiction there may be 
attributed such an immunity (whether or not claimed), it hereby irrevocably 
agrees not to claim and hereby irrevocably waives such immunity with 
respect to its obligations under this Agreement.

in form of export prepayments as defined in Circular No. 3027, issued by 
the Central Bank of Brazil on February 22, 2001 (as amended), in the total 
aggregate principal amount of U.S.$[·], pursuant to the terms and 
conditions set forth in Section 2.3(b)(i) of the Credit Agreement.

restate each of the Exporters existing export pre-payment agreements 
relating to (a) the Lender Bilateral Debt assigned to the Importer pursuant 
to Section 2.3(c) of the Credit Agreement, and (b) the Intercompany 
Obligations, so that the loans under these existing export pre-payment 
agreements (the Existing Importer Loans) shall be repaid pursuant to, and 
subject to the terms and conditions of, this Agreement. From time to time,

pursuant to a Facility Increase Amendment, the Importer and Exporter hereby 
agree to amend and restate this Agreement so that the loans under such 
Additional Bilateral Debt assigned to the Importer pursuant to a Facility

and conditions of, this Agreement.

resale of the Products by the Importer to any Eligible Offtaker or to any

from time to time following the Closing Date to reflect any prepayment made 
hereunder and any assignment to the Importer of Additional Bilateral Debt

repayment of the Importer Loans will be through the Exports. In the event 
that any amount under the Importer Loans is not paid when due, or if any 
amount under the Importer Loans remains outstanding on the Maturity Date, 
the Exporter shall pay such amount to the Importer in cash in accordance 
with Section 2.6.
 
SECTION 2.5 Interest. (a) The Exporter agrees to pay or cause to be paid to 
the Importer interest on the unpaid principal amount of the Importer Loans 
for the period from and including the Closing Date to but excluding the 
date on which the Importer Loans are paid in full, in respect of each 
Interest Period, at a per annum rate equal to the LIBO Rate for such 
Interest Period plus the Applicable Margin. Interest payable hereunder 
shall continue to accrue after as well as before any bankruptcy, 
insolvency, reorganization, recuperação judicial, recuperação 
extrajudicial, liquidation, falência, dissolution, arrangement or winding 
up or composition or readjustment of debts of the Exporter, and shall be 
paid through the credit of the corresponding proceeds in the Export 
Collateral Account.
 
(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Exporter agrees to pay or cause to 
be paid to the Importer interest on any and all overdue amounts outstanding 
under the Importer Loans at the Default Rate at any time during the 
existence and continuance of an Event of Default under Section 6.1(a).
 
(c) Accrued interest on the Importer Loans shall be payable on each Payment 
Date, provided that interest payable at the Default Rate shall also be 
payable on any and all overdue amounts outstanding under the Importer Loans 
from time to time on demand by the Importer or, upon the occurrence and 
during the continuation of an Event of Default (as defined in the Credit 
Agreement) under Section 9.1(a) of the Credit Agreement, by the 
Administrative Agent (acting at the direction of the Majority Lenders).
 
(d) On each Interest Determination Date, the Administrative Agent shall 
determine the LIBO Rate for the relevant Interest Period and shall give 
notice thereof to the Exporter (it being understood that the Administrative 
Agents failure to do so shall not affect the interest rate applicable 
hereunder). If, on the Interest Determination Date, the LIBOR 01 Page is 
not being displayed, the Administrative Agent will request the Reference 
Banks to provide the Administrative Agent with their offered quotations for 
deposits in U.S. Dollars, for a period substantially equal to the 
applicable Interest Period and in an amount substantially equal to the 
outstanding principal amount of the Importer Loans, to prime lenders in the 
London interbank market at approximately 11:00a.m., London time, on such 
Business Day. If at least two (2) such
 
P-8
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
quotations are provided, the LIBO Rate shall be calculated using the 
average of such quotations, and divided (rounded upwards, if necessary, to 
the nearest 1/16th of 1%) by a percentage equal to 100% minus the then 
stated maximum rate of all reserve requirements, if any (including, without 
limitation, any marginal, emergency, supplemental, special or other 
reserves) applicable on the Interest Determination Date to any member bank 
of the United States Federal Reserve System in respect of Eurocurrency 
liabilities (as defined in Regulation D). If (A) fewer than two Reference 
Banks provide quotations to the Administrative Agent to determine the LIBO 
Rate, or (B) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Reference Banks 
that deposits in U.S. Dollars are not offered to the Reference Banks in the 
London interbank market for such Interest Period, the Administrative Agent 
shall forthwith give notice thereof to the Exporter and the Exporter and 
the Importer shall negotiate in good faith to determine the LIBO Rate or a 
substitute rate. Pending such determination, the Interest Rate shall be 
computed on the basis of the LIBO Rate as determined for the immediately 
preceding Interest Period. If the Exporter and the Importer reach an 
agreement as to the determination of the LIBO Rate or a substitute rate 
within ten (10) Business Days, after the giving of notice by the 
Administrative Agent, the Importer Loans shall bear interest at an interest 
rate equal to the sum of the LIBO Rate or such substitute rate as agreed by 
the Exporter and the Importer and the Applicable Margin. If the Exporter 
and the Importer do not reach an agreement within such period, the Importer 
Loans shall bear interest at an interest rate equal to the sum of the 
Alternative Rate in effect from time to time and the Applicable Margin 
until such time as the LIBO Rate can be determined.
 
(e) Interest on the Loans based upon the LIBO Rate shall be computed on the 
basis of a year of 360 days and actual days elapsed (including the first 
day but excluding the last day) occurring in the relevant Interest Period.
 
SECTION 2.6 Payments. All cash payments of principal and interest to be 
made by the Exporter to the Importer under this Agreement shall be made in 
U.S. Dollars, in immediately available funds, without deduction, set-off or 
counterclaim, to the Export Collateral Account.
 
SECTION 2.7 Governmental Approvals. In connection with each Export, the 
Exporter shall be responsible for obtaining all required Governmental 
Approvals and for satisfying whatever formalities may be required with 
respect to any Export and to take such other actions related thereto as the 
Importer may reasonably request, and to deliver evidence of any such 
Governmental Approvals within a reasonable time after the Administrative 
Agents request, acting at the direction of the Majority Lenders, therefor.
 
SECTION 2.8 Promissory Notes. The Borrowers obligation to pay the 
principal amount of and any interest accrued on the Importer Loans shall be 
evidenced by a promissory note, substantially in the form of Exhibit A 
hereto (each, a Note and, collectively, the Notes).(1)
 
SECTION 2.9 New Promissory Notes. The Exporter shall promptly execute and 
deliver new Notes satisfactory to the Importer to substitute for the Notes 
previously delivered to the Importer, at the Importers request: (a) to 
reflect any changes to the loans, to the Interest

and the interest expected to accrue during the first Interest Period.
 
P-9
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Period or to the Applicable Margin, according to Section 2.5 above, and 
quarterly, at the beginning of each Interest Period, to reflect the 
interest expected to accrue during such Interest Period, or (b) to maintain 
a valid and enforceable Note throughout the term of this Agreement, until 
full repayment of the loans by the Exporter, in which case a new Note shall 
be issued not less than thirty (30) days prior to the end of the limitation 
period as established in the Note in light of the statute of limitations 
provided for by Brazilian law.(2)

Aracruz Trading (as borrower) in an aggregate principal amount of U.S.$[·
]; and
 
WHEREAS, in order to secure the prompt and punctual payment of all of 
Aracruz Tradings obligations under the Credit Agreement (such obligations 
being hereinafter referred to as Secured Obligations are more fully 
detailed below), Aracruz has agreed to render the guaranty provided for 
herein.
 
NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as follows:
 
ARTICLE I
DEFINITIONS
 
Section 1.1         Certain Defined Terms. (a) The terms used herein and 
initialized by capital letters, except if otherwise provided for in this 
Guaranty, shall have the same meaning ascribed to them in the Credit 
Agreement. All the terms defined in this Guaranty shall have the same 
meaning whenever used in any other certificate or document delivered or 
prepared in relation to this Guaranty, except if otherwise provided for in 
such certificate or document.
 
(b)       All references to the Collateral Agent contained in this Guaranty 
shall be construed as references to the Collateral Agent, in its capacity 
as representative of the Lenders.
 
ARTICLE II
GUARANTY
 
Section 2.1         Guaranty. Aracruz hereby unconditionally guarantees the 
punctual payment when due (either in the original maturity date, in case of 
acceleration or in any
 
U-2
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
other date as provided in the Credit Agreement) of any and all Secured 
Obligations (as described and defined in Section 3 below) of Aracruz 
Trading now or hereafter existing and agrees to pay any and all expenses 
(including reasonable counsel fees and expenses) incurred by the Collateral 
Agent in enforcing any rights under this Guaranty, in the exclusive benefit 
of the Lenders. Upon the failure by Aracruz Trading to pay any of the 
Secured Obligations when due, the Collateral Agent may proceed directly and 
at once against Aracruz to collect payment from Aracruz hereunder without 
first having to exhaust any remedies against Aracruz Trading.
 
ARTICLE III
SECURED OBLIGATIONS
 
Section 3.1         Secured Obligations. For good and valuable 
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby 
acknowledged, Aracruz hereby unconditionally and irrevocably, jointly and 
severally, guarantees the full and punctual payment of (i) all principal of 
all Loans outstanding under the Credit Agreement, (ii) all interest 
(including any interest that accrues after the commencement of any case, 
proceeding or other action relating to the bankruptcy, insolvency or 
reorganization of Aracruz Trading (or would accrue but for the operation of 
applicable bankruptcy or insolvency laws, whether or not such interest is 
allowed or allowable as a claim in any such proceedings) on such Loans and 
(iii) all other amounts now or hereafter payable by Aracruz Trading 
pursuant to the Credit Agreement and any other agreement related to it 
(collectively, the Loan Documents) when due (whether at stated maturity, 
upon acceleration or otherwise), and performance of all obligations (of any 
nature whatsoever) of Aracruz Trading under the Loan Documents, as primary 
obligor and not merely as surety and with respect to all such obligations 
howsoever created, arising or evidenced, whether direct or indirect, 
absolute or contingent, now or hereafter existing, or due or to become due. 
This is a guarantee of payment and not merely of collection. If Aracruz 
Trading fails to pay any Secured Obligation punctually when due, Aracruz 
agrees that it will forthwith on demand pay the amount not so paid at the 
place and in the manner specified in this Guaranty.
 
ARTICLE IV
GUARANTY ABSOLUTE
 
Section 4.1         Guaranty Absolute. Aracruz hereby unconditionally 
guarantees that the Secured Obligations will be paid strictly in accordance 
with the terms set forth in the Credit Agreement, regardless of any law, 
regulation or order now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction 
affecting any of such terms or the rights of the Lenders with respect 
thereto. Aracruz hereby expressly waives the benefits set forth in the 
following articles of Brazilian Law: articles 366, 821, 827, 829, 830, 834,

or waiver of or consent to departure from any other guaranty, for all or 
any of the Secured Obligations; or
 
(d)       any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a defense 
available to, or a discharge of, Aracruz Trading in respect of the Secured 
Obligations or Aracruz in respect of this Guaranty, and shall not be 
affected by any compromise, arrangement (including bankruptcy) or any plan 
of reorganization affecting Aracruz Trading.
 
ARTICLE V
CONTINUING GUARANTY
 
Section 5.1         Continuing Guaranty. This Guaranty shall continue to be

of any of the Secured Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be 
returned by the Collateral Agent upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, 
reorganization, recuperação judicial, recuperação extrajudicial, falência 
or similar event of Aracruz Trading or otherwise, all as though such 
payment had not been made.
 
ARTICLE VI
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
 
Section 6.1         Representations and Warranties. Aracruz hereby 
represents and warrants to the Collateral Agent that on the date hereof and 
during the term of effectiveness of this Guaranty, in relation to 
supervening facts and circumstances:

ARTICLE X
JUDGMENT
 
Section 10.1       Judgment. (a) If, for the purposes of obtaining a 
judgment in any competent court, it is necessary to convert a sum due under 
any of the Loan Documents in United States Dollars into another currency, 
the parties hereto agree, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that the 
rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal 
banking procedures the Collateral Agent could purchase United States 
Dollars with such other currency on the Business Day preceding that on 
which final judgment is given.
 
(b)       The obligation of Aracruz in respect of any sum due in United 
States Dollars from it to the Collateral Agent hereunder shall be 
discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by 
the Collateral Agent of any sum adjudged to be so due in such other 
currency the Collateral Agent may in accordance with normal banking 
procedures purchase United States Dollars with such other currency; if the 
United States Dollars so purchased are less than the sum originally due to 
the Collateral Agent in United States Dollars, Aracruz agrees, as a 
separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify the 
Collateral Agent against such loss, and if the United States Dollars so 
purchased exceed the sum originally due to the Collateral Agent in United 
States Dollars, the Collateral Agent agrees to remit to Aracruz such 
excess.

GUAÍBA II PROJECT
 
(1)           Construction of a single line pulp mill on a site adjacent to 
an existing pulp mill owned and operated by Aracruz Celulose in the 
Municipality of Guaíba, State of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, with an 
estimated manufacturing capacity of approximately 1.5 million metric tons 
of eucalyptus pulp per year (the Guaíba II Mill)
 
(2)           Acquisition of land and forests and any investments and 
capital expenditures necessary in connection with silviculture activities 
with respect to any forests associated with the Guaíba II Mill, in each 
case that are necessary to produce the raw materials for the production of 
pulp associated with the Guaíba II Mill.
 
(3)           Construction and operation of roads and any other logistical 
infrastructure necessary for (a) the transportation of raw materials and 
personnel to the Guaíba II Mill and (b) the distribution of products 
manufactured in the Guaíba II Mill.
 
(4)           Construction of any ancillary facilities necessary for the 
operation of the Guaíba II Mill.
 
(5)           Purchase or lease of any equipment necessary for the 
operation of the Guaíba II Mill
 
The Guaíba II Project currently has a total projected cost of approximately 
U.S.$2.746 billion. This amount represents Aracruz Celuloses current, 
reasonable judgment in respect of the approximate total capital expenditure 
budget for the Guaíba II Project. However, this amount is an estimate and 
is subject to change based upon fluctuations in construction, equipment and 
technology costs, labor costs, inflation, foreign exchange rates and other 
factors, including factors that are outside of Aracruz Celuloses control. 
In addition, this amount may vary as the Guaíba II Project is further 
defined and developed, including, without limitation, as a result of any 
changes in the proposed implementation timetable, proposed suppliers and 
contractors and the proposed project design, technology or equipment.

HEDGING GUIDELINES
 
(Free translation of excerpts from the Financing Policy of Aracruz Celulose 
S.A. approved by its Board of Directors on June 19, 2008)
 
    2.3        CREDIT RISK
 
To set forth acceptable levels of credit risk (rating) and exposure for the 
acquisition and holding of assets and financial instruments in Brazil and 
abroad.
 
2.3.1       Financial Institutions
 
For those rated BBB+, the amount shall be limited to US$50 million per 
financial-economic group, in compliance with a limit of 5% of the 
consolidated Net Assets of the financial institutions that are part of the 
same economic group. The amount invested in financial institutions rated 
BBB+ shall not exceed, in the aggregate, 10% of the cash available invested 
in the country. In case of a better rating, the maximum amount shall be of 
up to 10% of the consolidated Net Assets of the financial institutions of 
the same economic group, provided that the total amount of investment in 
each financial-economic group is limited to 20% of the available cash of 
the company. In case there are two or more ratings from different rating 
agencies, the highest rating shall prevail.
 
Additionally, the company may not hold investments in excess of 10% of the 
aggregate amount of outstanding issuances of the same issuer, calculated 
based on the financial statements used as a basis for updating the credit 
limits. The aggregate amount of the issuances of an issuer shall include, 
in addition to deposit certificates, any other instruments issued by such 
issuer to raise funds.
 
For banks with a majority of foreign-held capital, whose parent company has 
a minimum rating of A-, there shall be no limit based on the net assets 
of the local subsidiary, provided that there is sufficient evidence that 
the parent company will back the obligations of its subsidiary.
 
For institutions that are members of financial conglomerates, either 
because they are under common control with, controlled, subsidiaries or 
branches, the consolidated financial statements of the corresponding 
economic group shall be taken into account, both for rating purposes and 
for the limit of the net assets and aggregate amount of issuances 
outstanding. Notwithstanding the above, the comfort provided to each 
subsidiary by its parent companies shall be also reviewed.
 
The company shall evaluate semi-annually the credit limits and submit them 
to the Treasury Committee.
 
Any exceptions to the provisions set forth in this Policy shall be 
submitted to the
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Treasury Committee by the Chief Financial Officer.
 
(...)
 
2.3.5 - Derivatives
 
The company shall abide by the limit of U.S.$50 million in notional value 
for the aggregate amount of derivative transactions with each bank or 
counterparty, and the maximum term of one year with respect to derivative 
transactions known as NDF, provided that foreign banks that are 
counterparties to such derivative transactions must be based in G-7 
countries and have a rating of A- or better. In addition, the company 
shall observe the credit limit of the bank or counterparty (item 2.3.1) 
and, in this connection, shall consider as the amount of credit used in any 
given derivative transaction the notional value times the percentage 
representing the maximum loss potential for that derivative transaction. 
The percentage to be applied to the notional value of a derivative 
transaction shall be 5% for transactions with terms of up to 60 days and 
10% for transactions with terms of more than 60 days and up to one year.
 
(...)
 
2.4  TRANSACTIONS AND INSTRUMENTS
 
2.4.1  Hedging of assets and liabilities (see Annex I)
 
The companys hedging of USGAAP assets and liabilities, regarding the risks 
associated with foreign exchange and interest rates should be a permanent 
objective. In order to achieve this objective, management is permitted to 
use financial instruments, in particular derivatives.
 
The company may also carry out transactions to hedge cash flow, to protect 
its operating income against exchange risks related to its future revenues 
and expenses.
 
The decisions related to these hedging transactions shall be discussed with 
the Treasury Committee based on macroeconomic conditions and on the 
performance of the financial markets. In particular, these hedging 
transactions shall comply with prudential exposure limits, which limits 
shall be discussed and agreed upon with the Treasury Committee. The basic 
pre-established limits are:
 
   ·                             Maximum acceptable loss in derivative
   transactions: Shall be limited to U.S.$40 million. However, before
   reaching the abovementioned amount, the management must meet with the
   Treasury Committee to discuss the issue and, with respect to losses
   above such amount, the decision shall be shared with the Board of
   Directors through its Chairman;
    
   ·                             Maximum exposure permitted in futures
   exchange transactions: Shall be limited to any of the following
   indicators, at the discretion of the Treasury
 
2
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
   Committee:
    
          ·                            1.5 times the cash cost of total
          budgeted production denominated in reais;
           
          ·                            50% of the amount of annual exports;
           
          ·                            Amount of the annual operating cash
          flow.
           
   ·                             Maximum exposure permitted in futures
   interest rate transactions: The amount corresponding to the cash
   available invested in floating interest rate securities;
    
   ·                             Volatility limits in cash financial
   investments: The aggregate of financial investments through an exclusive
   fund shall comply with the maximum volatility of 1% per day, with a
   reliability of a 95% confidence interval (Value at Risk).
    
2.4.2  Arbitration Transactions (see Annex I)
 
The transactions shall be only subordinated to the limitations imposed by 
the criteria and rules of the company for financial, market and credit 
risks in the management of monetary assets and liabilities.
 
(...)
 
Annex 1  Definitions used in the Financing Policy
 
(...)
 
Arbitration Transactions: Consists of taking opposite positions in the 
market to benefit from a price distortion that may potentially exist. The 
arbitrator aims at benefiting from those opportunities. Normally they are 
fund-raising and lending transactions for the same amount and in the same 
currency, but with different interest rates. These transactions are subject 
to the limits proposed for gross indebtedness indicators.
 
(...)
 
Hedging transactions: Consists of taking a position opposite to one already 
existing, either by acquiring a cash flow, an asset or a contract 
(derivatives included) which shall be subject to variation in its value and 
shall neutralize the existing position.
 
(...)
 
Cash Flow Hedge: Is the possibility of balancing the flow of funds of the 
company from a foreign exchange perspective. For instance, the average 
EBITDA of the company is approximately 50%-98% of its revenue and 40% of 
disbursements are in dollars. Consequently, there is a natural mismatch in 
the operating cash flow corresponding to approximately 30% of the companys 
revenues (long position in
 
3
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
dollars). This would allow the company to sell in advance part of its 
revenue in dollars through financial transactions (ACC or swap / BMF). This 
transaction represents a bar to the operating margin, operating as if the 
costs in reais were fixed at a specified exchange rate in dollars.
 
(...)
 
Credit Risk Rating in Foreign Currency (GME): Rating of the credit risk 
quality of the issuer of a debt and its capacity to pay its obligations in 
foreign currency.
 
(...)
 
Value at Risk: Corresponds to the maximum potential loss in value of 
illiquid financial assets (financial assets and liabilities), which result 
from market performance and price development over a given period of time. 
The value-at-risk data and acceptable confidence intervals shall be 
periodically adjusted by means of consultations with the main investment 
funds administrators and international companies in the industry.
 
The VAR presents some problems to the extent that it uses past data which 
may alter its structure when the market is experimenting significant 
volatility.
 
Interpretation is direct: the lower the VAR, the lower the potential loss 
within a confidence interval of 95%. For example: if the VAR is 3%, the 
fund can drop by a maximum of 3% in the period.

VERACEL II PROJECT
 
(1)           Construction of a single line pulp mill on a site adjacent to 
an existing pulp mill owned by Veracel Celulose S.A. in the Municipality of 
Eunápolis, State of Bahia, Brazil, with an estimated manufacturing capacity 
of approximately 1.5 million metric tons of eucalyptus pulp per year (the 
Veracel II Mill).
 
(2)           Acquisition of land and forests and any investments and 
capital expenditures necessary in connection with silviculture activities 
with respect to any forests associated with the Veracel II Mill, in each 
case that are necessary to produce the raw materials for the production of 
pulp associated with the Veracel II Mill.
 
(3)           Construction and operation of roads and any other logistical 
infrastructure necessary for (a) the transportation of raw materials and 
personnel to the Veracel II Mill and (b) the distribution of products 
manufactured in the Veracel II Mill.
 
(4)           Construction of any ancillary facilities necessary for the 
operation of the Veracel II Mill.
 
(5)           Purchase or lease of any equipment necessary for the 
operation of the Veracel II Mill.
 
The Veracel II Project currently has a total projected cost of 
approximately U.S.$2.762 billion. This amount represents Aracruz Celuloses 
current, reasonable judgment in respect of the approximate total capital 
expenditure budget with respect to the Veracel II Project. However, this 
amount is an estimate and is subject to change based upon fluctuations in 
construction, equipment and technology costs, labor costs, inflation, 
foreign exchange rates and other factors, including factors that are 
outside of Aracruz Celuloses control. In addition, this amount may vary as 
the Veracel II Project is further defined and developed, including, without 
limitation, as a result of any changes in the proposed implementation 
timetable, proposed suppliers and contractors and the proposed project 
design, technology or equipment.
