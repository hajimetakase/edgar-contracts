The Sheridan Group, Inc. (the "Employer") and Robert M. Jakobe (the 
"Employee") wish to amend the Employee's Employment and Non-Competition 
Agreement (the "Employment Agreement"), dated April 1, 2007, to bring the 
Employment Agreement into compliance with the requirements of Internal 
Revenue Code section 409A and the Treasury Regulations and other 
authoritative guidance issued under that section.

WHEREAS, pursuant to IRS Notice 2007-86 and the final Treasury Regulations 
under Code section 409A, the Employment Agreement is being amended to 
comply with the final Treasury Regulations issued under Code section 409A.

Accordingly, effective April 1, 2007, the Employment Agreement is amended 
as follows:

1.  The second sentence of the first paragraph of Section 6(e)(iv) is 
amended by deleting the phrase that appears in brackets (i.e., by deleting 
"[or less than fifty percent (50%), if the Employee becomes an independent 
contractor]").

2.  Section 10(g) – Arbitration of Disputes – is amended by adding the 
following sentence to the end of that Section:

"Any reimbursement of reasonable fees and expenses under this Section shall 
be paid by the Employer to the Employee by the March 15 following the end 
of the year during which the Employee prevails in the dispute giving rise 
to such reimbursement."

In all other respects, the Employment Agreement shall remain in full force 
and effect.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties have caused this Amendment to be duly 
executed, effective as specified herein.
