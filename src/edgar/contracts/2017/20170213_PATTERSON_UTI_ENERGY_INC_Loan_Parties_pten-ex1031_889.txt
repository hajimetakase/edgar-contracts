Section 1.Defined Terms; Interpretation and Provisions.  As used in this 
Agreement, each of the terms defined in the opening paragraph and the 
Recitals above shall have the meanings assigned to such terms therein.  
Each term defined in the Credit Agreement, as amended hereby, and used 
herein without definition shall have the meaning assigned to such term in 
the Credit Agreement, as amended hereby, unless expressly provided to the 
contrary. Article, Section, Schedule, and Exhibit references are to 
Articles and Sections of and Schedules and Exhibits to this Agreement, 
unless otherwise specified.  The words “hereof”, “herein”, and “hereunder” 
and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this 
Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. 
 The term “including” means “including, without limitation”.  Paragraph 
headings have been inserted in this Agreement as a matter of convenience 
for reference only and it is agreed that such paragraph headings are not a 
part of this Agreement and shall not be used in the interpretation of any 
provision of this Agreement

Section 2.Amendments to Credit Agreement.  

(a)Section 1.1 of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended by adding the 
following definition in the appropriate alphabetical order:
“Seventy Seven Energy Acquisition” means the acquisition of Seventy Seven 
Energy Inc., a Delaware corporation, by the Borrower pursuant to that 
certain Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of December 12, 2016, by and 
among the Borrower, Seventy Seven Energy Inc. and Pyramid Merger Sub, Inc.
 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(b)Section 1.1 of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended by restating the 
definition of “Consolidated EBITDA” with the following:

“Consolidated EBITDA” means, for any period, for the Borrower and its 
Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, an amount equal to Consolidated Net 
Income for such period plus (a) the following to the extent deducted in 
calculating such Consolidated Net Income: (i) Consolidated Interest Charges 
for such period, (ii) the provision for Federal, state, local and foreign

taxes based on income) payable by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries for

such Consolidated Net Income, all non-cash items increasing Consolidated 
Net Income for such period.  For the purposes of calculating Consolidated 
EBITDA for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters, if the Borrower 
or any Subsidiary has had a material acquisition or disposition during such 
period, Consolidated EBITDA for such period shall be calculated after 
giving pro forma effect thereto as if such material acquisition or

Acquisition, all restructuring charges, fees and expenses incurred in 
connection with the Chapter 11 bankruptcy cases of Seventy Seven Energy 
Inc. and its Subsidiaries in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the 
District of Delaware shall, to the extent deducted in calculating 
Consolidated Net Income, be added back to Consolidated EBITDA.
