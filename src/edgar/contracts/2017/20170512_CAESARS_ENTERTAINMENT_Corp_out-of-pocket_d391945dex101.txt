Swingline Lender, may exceed the amount of such Lenders Revolving Facility 
Commitment under such Revolving Facility; provided, however, that after 
giving effect to any Swingline Loan, (i) the Revolving Facility Credit 
Exposure of the applicable Class shall not exceed the total Revolving 
Facility Commitments under such Revolving Facility of such Class, and (ii) 
the aggregate Revolving Facility Credit Exposure of any Revolving Facility 
Lender of such Class (other than the Swingline Lender) shall not exceed 
such Revolving Facility Lenders Revolving Facility Commitment of such 
Class, and provided, further, that the Swingline Lender shall not be 
required to make a Swingline Loan to refinance an outstanding Swingline 
Loan. Within the foregoing limits, and subject to the other terms and 
conditions hereof, any BorrowerBorrowers may borrow under this Section 
2.04, prepay under Section 2.11, and reborrow under this Section 2.04. Each 
Swingline Loan shall be an ABR Loan. Immediately upon the making of a 
Swingline Loan under any Revolving Facility, each Revolving Facility Lender 
under such Revolving Facility shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably 
and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the Swingline Lender a risk 
participation in such Swingline Loan in an amount equal to the product of 
such Lenders Revolving Facility Percentage under such Revolving Facility 
times the amount of such Swingline Loan.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(b)    Borrowing Procedures. Each Swingline Borrowing shall be made upon a 
Borrowers irrevocable notice to the Swingline Lender and the 
Administrative Agent, which may be given by telephone. Each such notice 
must be received by the Swingline Lender and the Administrative Agent not 
later than 1:00 p.m., Local Time, on the requested borrowing date, and 
shall specify (i) the amount to be borrowed and the Revolving Facility 
under which such borrowing is to occur, which shall be a minimum of 
$100,000, and (ii) the requested borrowing date, which shall be a Business 
Day. Each such telephonic notice must be confirmed promptly by delivery to 
the Swingline Lender and the Administrative Agent of a written Swingline 
Borrowing Request, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible 
Officer of the applicable Borrower. Promptly after receipt by the Swingline 
Lender of any telephonic Swingline Loan request, the Swingline Lender will 
confirm with the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) that the 
Administrative Agent has also received such Swingline Loan request and, if 
not, the Swingline Lender will notify the Administrative Agent (by 
telephone or in writing) of the contents thereof. Unless the Swingline 
Lender has received notice (by telephone or in writing) from the 
Administrative Agent (including at the request of any Lender) prior to 2:00 
p.m. on the date of the proposed Swingline Borrowing (A) directing the 
Swingline Lender not to make such Swingline Loan as a result of the 
limitations set forth in the proviso to the first sentence of Section 
2.04(a), or (B) that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in 
Section 4.01 is not then satisfied, then, subject to the terms and 
conditions hereof, the Swingline Lender will, not later than 3:00 p.m. 
Local Time, on the borrowing date specified in such Swingline Borrowing 
Request, make the amount of its Swingline Loan available to the applicable 
Borrower at the account of such Borrower specified in such Swingline 
Borrowing Request.

(c)    Refinancing of Swingline Loans.

(i)    The Swingline Lender at any time in its sole and absolute discretion 
may request, on behalf of the applicable Borrower (which hereby irrevocably 
authorizes the Swingline Lender to so request on its behalf), that each 
Revolving Facility Lender under the Revolving Facility pursuant to which 
such Swingline Loan was made make an ABR Revolving Loan in an amount equal 
to such Revolving Facility Lenders Revolving Facility Percentage of the 
amount of Swingline Loans then outstanding under such Revolving Facility. 
Such request shall be made in writing (which written request shall be 
deemed to be a Borrowing Request for purposes hereof) and in accordance 
with the requirements of Section 2.02, without regard to the Borrowing 
Minimum and Borrowing Multiples, but subject to the unutilized portion of 
the Revolving Facility Commitments under such Revolving Facility and the 
conditions set forth in Section 4.01. The Swingline Lender shall furnish 
the applicable Borrower with a copy of the applicable Borrowing Request 
promptly after delivering such notice to the Administrative Agent. Each 
Revolving Facility Lender with a Revolving Facility Commitment under the 
applicable Revolving Facility shall make an amount equal to its Revolving 
Facility Percentage under the Revolving Facility pursuant to which such 
Swingline Loan was made of the amount specified in such Borrowing Request 
available to the Administrative Agent in Same Day Funds for the account of 
the Swingline Lender at the Administrative Agents Office for 
Dollar-denominated payments not later than 1:00 p.m. on the day specified 
in such Borrowing Request, whereupon, subject to Section 2.04(c)(ii), each 
Revolving Facility Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to 
have made an ABR Revolving Loan to the applicable Borrower in such amount 
under such Revolving Facility. The Administrative Agent shall remit the 
funds so received to the Swingline Lender.
 
78

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(ii)    If for any reason any Swingline Loan cannot be refinanced by such 
an ABR Revolving Facility Borrowing in accordance with Section 2.04(c)(i), 
the request for ABR Revolving Loans submitted by the Swingline Lender as 
set forth herein shall be deemed to be a request by the Swingline Lender 
that each of the Revolving Facility Lenders under such Revolving Facility 
fund its risk participation in the relevant Swingline Loan and each 
Revolving Facility Lenders payment to the Administrative Agent for the 
account of the Swingline Lender pursuant to Section 2.04(c)(i) shall be 
deemed payment in respect of such participation.

(iii)    If any Revolving Facility Lender under the applicable Revolving 
Facility fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the 
account of the Swingline Lender any amount required to be paid by such 
Revolving Facility Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this 
Section 2.04(c) by the time specified in Section 2.04(c)(i), the Swingline 
Lender shall be entitled to recover from such Revolving Facility Lender 
(acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with 
interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to 
the date on which such payment is immediately available to the Swingline 
Lender at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate from time 
to time in effect, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees 
customarily charged by the Swingline Lender in connection with the 
foregoing. If such Revolving Facility Lender pays such amount (with 
interest and fees as aforesaid), the amount so paid shall constitute such 
Lenders ABR Revolving Loan included in the relevant ABR Revolving Facility 
Borrowing or funded participation in the relevant Swingline Loan, as the 
case may be. A certificate of the Swingline Lender submitted to any 
Revolving Facility Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect 
to any amounts owing under this clause (iii) shall be conclusive absent 
manifest error.

(iv)    Each Revolving Facility Lenders obligation to make ABR Revolving 
Loans or to purchase and fund risk participations in Swingline Loans 
pursuant to this Section 2.04(c) shall be absolute and unconditional and 
shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff, 
counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have 
against the Swingline Lender, any Borrower or any other person for any 
reason whatsoever, (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, or (C) 
any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of 
the foregoing; provided, however, that each Lenders obligation to make ABR 
Revolving Loans pursuant to this Section 2.04(c) is subject to the 
conditions set forth in Section 4.01. No such funding of risk 
participations shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of any 
Borrower to repay Swingline Loans, together with interest as provided 
herein.

(d)    Repayment of Participations.

(i)    At any time after any Revolving Facility Lender has purchased and 
funded a risk participation in a Swingline Loan, if the Swingline Lender 
receives any payment on account of such Swingline Loan, the Swingline 
Lender will distribute to such Revolving Facility Lender its Revolving 
Facility Percentage thereof in the same funds as those received by the 
Swingline Lender.
 
79

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(ii)    If any payment received by the Swingline Lender in respect of 
principal or interest on any Swingline Loan made under any Revolving 
Facility is required to be returned by the Swingline Lender under any of 
the circumstances described in Section 8.10 (including pursuant to any 
settlement entered into by the Swingline Lender in its discretion), each 
Revolving Facility Lender under such Revolving Facility shall pay to the 
Swingline Lender its Revolving Facility Percentage thereof on demand of the 
Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to 
the date such amount is returned, at a rate per annum equal to the 
applicable Overnight Rate. The Administrative Agent will make such demand 
upon the request of the Swingline Lender. The obligations of the Revolving 
Facility Lenders under this clause shall survive the payment in full of the 
Obligations and the termination of this Agreement.

(e)    Interest for Account of Swingline Lender. The Swingline Lender shall 
be responsible for invoicing the applicable Borrower for interest on the 
Swingline Loans. Until each Revolving Facility Lender under the applicable 
Revolving Facility funds its ABR Revolving Loan or risk participation 
pursuant to this Section 2.04 to refinance such Revolving Facility Lenders 
Revolving Facility Percentage of any Swingline Loan, interest in respect of 
such Revolving Facility Percentage shall be solely for the account of the 
Swingline Lender.

(f)    Payments Directly to Swingline Lender. The applicable Borrower shall 
make all payments of principal and interest in respect of the Swingline 
Loans directly to the Swingline Lender.

(g)    Additional Swingline Lenders. From time to time, any Borrower may by 
notice to the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Administrative 
Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and the 
applicable Revolving Facility Lender designate such Revolving Facility 
Lender (in addition to Citibank) to act as a Swingline Lender hereunder. In 
the event that there shall be more than one Swingline Lender hereunder, 
each reference to the Swingline Lender hereunder with respect to any 
Swingline Loan shall refer to the person that made such Swingline Loan and 
each such additional Swingline Lender shall be entitled to the benefits of 
this Agreement as a Swingline Lender to the same extent as if it had been 
originally named as the Swingline Lender hereunder. Promptly after making 
any Swingline Loan or receiving any payment with respect to any Swingline 
Loan, the Swingline Lender will provide the Administrative Agent with the 
details thereof. On the last Business Day of each March, June, September 
and December (and on such other dates as the Administrative Agent may 
request), each Swingline Lender shall provide the Administrative Agent a 
list of all Swingline Loans made by it that are outstanding at such time 
together with such other information as the Administrative Agent may 
reasonably request.

SECTION 2.05.    The Letter of Credit Commitment.

(a)    General.

(i)    Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, (A) the L/C 
Issuer agrees, in reliance upon the agreements of the Revolving Facility 
Lenders set forth in this Section 2.05, (1) from time to time on any 
Business Day during the period from and including the Closing Date until 
the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, to issue Letters of Credit under any
 
80

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Revolving Facility denominated in Dollars for the account of any Borrower 
or its Subsidiaries, and to amend or extend Letters of Credit previously 
issued by it, in accordance with clause (b) below, and (2) to honor 
drawings under the Letters of Credit; and (B) the Revolving Facility 
Lenders under each Revolving Facility severally agree to participate in 
Letters of Credit issued under such Revolving Facility for the account of 
any Borrower or its Subsidiaries and any drawings thereunder; provided 
that after giving effect to any L/C Credit Extension with respect to any 
Letter of Credit under any Revolving Facility, (w) the total Revolving 
Facility Credit Exposure under such Revolving Facility shall not exceed the 
total Revolving Facility Commitments under such Revolving Facility, (x) no 
Lenders Revolving Facility Credit Exposure under such Revolving Facility 
shall exceed such Lenders Revolving Facility Commitment under such 
Revolving Facility and (y) the Outstanding Amount of the L/C Obligations 
shall not exceed the Letter of Credit Sublimit. Each request by the 
applicable Borrower for the issuance or amendment of a Letter of Credit 
shall be deemed to be a representation by such Borrower that the L/C Credit 
Extension so requested complies with the conditions set forth in the 
proviso to the preceding sentence. Within the foregoing limits, and subject 
to the terms and conditions hereof, the applicable Borrowers ability to 
obtain Letters of Credit shall be fully revolving, and accordingly such 
Borrower or any Subsidiary may, during the foregoing period with respect to 
any Revolving Facility, obtain Letters of Credit to replace Letters of 
Credit that have expired or that have been drawn upon and reimbursed. All 
Existing Letters of Credit shall be deemed to have been issued pursuant 
hereto, and from and after the Closing Date shall be subject to and 
governed by the terms and conditions hereof.

(ii)    The L/C Issuer shall not issue any Letter of Credit under any 
Revolving Facility, if:

(A)    subject to Section 2.05(b)(iii), the expiry date of such requested 
Letter of Credit would occur more than twelve months after the date of 
issuance or last extension, unless the Majority Lenders under thesuch 
Revolving Facility have approved such expiry date (such approval not to be 
unreasonably withheld or delayed); or

(B)    the expiry date of such requested Letter of Credit would occur after 
the Letter of Credit Expiration Date for such Revolving Facility, unless 
all the Revolving Facility Lenders under such Revolving Facility have 
approved such expiry date (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or 
delayed).

(iii)    The L/C Issuer shall not be under any obligation to issue any 
Letter of Credit under any Revolving Facility if:

(A)    any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority or 
arbitrator shall by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain the L/C Issuer 
from issuing such Letter of Credit, or any Requirement of Law applicable to 
the L/C Issuer or any request or directive (whether or not having the force 
of law) from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over the L/C 
Issuer shall prohibit, or request that the L/C Issuer refrain from, the 
issuance of letters of credit generally or such Letter of Credit in 
particular or shall impose upon the L/C Issuer with respect to such Letter 
of Credit any restriction, reserve or capital requirement (for which the 
L/C Issuer is not otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect on the 
Closing Date, or shall impose upon the L/C Issuer any unreimbursed loss, 
cost or expense which was not applicable on the Closing Date and which the 
L/C Issuer in good faith deems material to it;
 
81

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(B)    the issuance of such Letter of Credit would violate one or more 
policies of the L/C Issuer applicable to letters of credit generally;

(C)    except as otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent and the L/C 
Issuer, such Letter of Credit is in an initial stated amount less than 
$100,000, in the case of a commercial Letter of Credit, or $500,000, in the 
case of a standby Letter of Credit;

(D)    such Letter of Credit contains any provisions for automatic 
reinstatement of the stated amount after any drawing thereunder; or

(E)    a default of any Revolving Facility Lenders obligations to fund
Lender under such Revolving Facility to fund its obligations under Section 
2.05(c) exists or any Revolving Facility Lender under such Revolving 
Facility is at such time a Defaulting Lender hereunder, unless the L/C 
Issuer has entered into satisfactory arrangements with the applicable 
Borrower or such Revolving Facility Lender to eliminate the L/C Issuers 
Fronting Exposure with respect to such Revolving Facility Lender.

(iv)    The L/C Issuer shall not amend any Letter of Credit if the L/C 
Issuer would not be permitted at such time to issue such Letter of Credit 
in its amended form under the terms hereof.

(v)    The L/C Issuer shall be under no obligation to amend any Letter of 
Credit if (A) the L/C Issuer would have no obligation at such time to issue 
such Letter of Credit in its amended form under the terms hereof, or (B) 
the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit does not accept the proposed 
amendment to such Letter of Credit.

(vi)    The L/C Issuer shall act on behalf of the Revolving Facility 
Lenders under the applicable Revolving Facility with respect to any Letters 
of Credit issued by it and the documents associated therewith, and the L/C 
Issuer shall have all of the benefits and immunities (A) provided to the 
Administrative Agent in Article VIII with respect to any acts taken or 
omissions suffered by the L/C Issuer in connection with Letters of Credit 
issued by it or proposed to be issued by it and Issuer Documents pertaining 
to such Letters of Credit as fully as if the term Administrative Agent as 
used in Article VIII included the L/C Issuer with respect to such acts or 
omissions, and (B) as additionally provided herein with respect to the L/C 
Issuer.

(b)    Procedures for Issuance and Amendment of Letters of Credit; 
Auto-Extension Letters of Credit.

(i)    Each Letter of Credit shall be issued or amended, as the case may 
be, upon the request of the applicable Borrower delivered to the L/C Issuer 
(with a copy to the Administrative Agent) in the form of a Letter of Credit 
Application, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of 
such Borrower. Such Letter of Credit Application must be received by the 
L/C Issuer and the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. at least 
two Business Days (or such later date and time as the Administrative Agent 
and the L/C Issuer may
 
82

------------------------------------------------------------------------
agree in a particular instance in their sole discretion) prior to the 
proposed issuance date or date of amendment, as the case may be. In the 
case of a request for an initial issuance of a Letter of Credit, such 
Letter of Credit Application shall specify in form and detail satisfactory 
to the L/C Issuer: (A) the proposed issuance date of the requested Letter 
of Credit (which shall be a Business Day); (B) the amount and currency 
thereof; (C) the expiry date thereof; (D) the name and address of the 
beneficiary thereof and the Revolving Facility under which such Letter of 
Credit is being issued; (E) the documents to be presented by such 
beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; (F) the full text of any 
certificate to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing 
thereunder; and (G) such other matters as the L/C Issuer may reasonably 
request. In the case of a request for an amendment of any outstanding 
Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit Application shall specify in form 
and detail satisfactory to the L/C Issuer (A) the Letter of Credit to be 
amended; (B) the proposed date of amendment thereof (which shall be a 
Business Day); (C) the nature of the proposed amendment; and (D) such other 
matters as the L/C Issuer may reasonably request. Additionally, the 
applicable Borrower shall furnish to the L/C Issuer and the Administrative 
Agent such other documents and information pertaining to such requested 
Letter of Credit issuance or amendment, including any Issuer Documents, as 
the L/C Issuer or the Administrative Agent may reasonably request.

(ii)    Promptly after receipt of any Letter of Credit Application, the L/C 
Issuer will confirm with the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in 
writing) that the Administrative Agent has received a copy of such Letter 
of Credit Application from the applicable Borrower and, if not, the L/C 
Issuer will provide the Administrative Agent with a copy thereof. Unless 
the L/C Issuer has received written notice from any Revolving Facility 
Lender under the applicable Revolving Facility, the Administrative Agent or 
any Loan Party, at least one Business Day prior to the requested date of 
issuance or amendment of the applicable Letter of Credit, that one or more 
applicable conditions contained in Section 4.01 shall not then be 
satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the L/C Issuer 
shall, on the requested date, issue a Letter of Credit for the account of 
the applicable Borrower (or the applicable Subsidiary) or enter into the 
applicable amendment, as the case may be, in each case in accordance with 
the L/C Issuers usual and customary business practices. Immediately upon 
the issuance of each Letter of Credit under any Revolving Facility, each 
Revolving Facility Lender under such Revolving Facility shall be deemed to, 
and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the L/C 
Issuer a risk participation in such Letter of Credit in an amount equal to 
the product of such Lenders Revolving Facility Percentage under such 
Revolving Facility times the amount of such Letter of Credit.

(iii)    If the applicable Borrower so requests in any applicable Letter of 
Credit Application, the L/C Issuer may, in its sole and absolute 
discretion, agree to issue a Letter of Credit under any Revolving Facility 
that has automatic extension provisions (each, an Auto-Extension Letter of 
Credit); provided that any such Auto-Extension Letter of Credit must 
permit the L/C Issuer to prevent any such extension at least once in each 
twelve-month period (commencing with the date of issuance of such Letter of 
Credit) by giving prior notice to the beneficiary thereof not later than a 
day (the Non-Extension Notice Date) in each such twelve-month period to 
be agreed upon at the time such Letter of Credit is issued. Unless 
otherwise directed by the L/C Issuer, the applicable Borrower shall not be 
required to make a specific request to the L/C Issuer for any such 
extension. Once an Auto-Extension Letter of Credit under any Revolving 
Facility has been issued, the Revolving Facility Lenders shall be deemed to 
have
 
83

------------------------------------------------------------------------
authorized (but may not require) the L/C Issuer to permit the extension of 
such Letter of Credit at any time to an expiry date not later than the 
Letter of Credit Expiration Date under such Revolving Facility; provided, 
however, that the L/C Issuer shall not permit any such extension if (A) the 
L/C Issuer has determined that it would not be permitted at such time to 
issue such Letter of Credit in its revised form (as extended) under the 
terms hereof (by reason of the provisions of clause (ii) or (iii) of 
Section 2.05(a) or otherwise), or (B) it has received notice (which may be 
by telephone or in writing) on or before the day that is five Business Days 
before the Non-Extension Notice Date (1) from the Administrative Agent that 
the Majority Lenders under the applicable Revolving Facility have elected 
not to permit such extension or (2) from the Administrative Agent, any 
Revolving Facility Lender under the applicable Revolving Facility or the 
applicable Borrower that one or more of the applicable conditions specified 
in Section 4.01 is not then satisfied, and in each such case directing the 
L/C Issuer not to permit such extension.

(iv)    If the applicable Borrower so requests in any applicable Letter of 
Credit Application, the L/C Issuer may, in its sole and absolute 
discretion, agree to issue a Letter of Credit under any Revolving Facility 
that permits the automatic reinstatement of all or a portion of the stated 
amount thereof after any drawing thereunder (each, an Auto-Reinstatement 
Letter of Credit). Unless otherwise directed by the L/C Issuer, the 
applicable Borrower shall not be required to make a specific request to the 
L/C Issuer to permit such reinstatement. Once an Auto-Reinstatement Letter 
of Credit has been issued under any Revolving Facility, except as provided 
in the following sentence, the Revolving Facility Lenders under such 
Revolving Facility shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not require) 
the L/C Issuer to reinstate all or a portion of the stated amount thereof 
in accordance with the provisions of such Letter of Credit. Notwithstanding 
the foregoing, if such Auto-Reinstatement Letter of Credit permits the L/C 
Issuer to decline to reinstate all or any portion of the stated amount 
thereof after a drawing thereunder by giving notice of such 
non-reinstatement within a specified number of days after such drawing (the 
Non-Reinstatement Deadline), the L/C Issuer shall not permit such 
reinstatement if it has received a notice (which may be by telephone or in 
writing) on or before the day that is five Business Days before the 
Non-Reinstatement Deadline (A) from the Administrative Agent that the 
Majority Lenders under the applicable Revolving Facility have elected not 
to permit such reinstatement or (B) from the Administrative Agent, any 
Revolving Facility Lender under the applicable Revolving Facility or the 
applicable Borrower that one or more of the applicable conditions specified 
in Section 4.01 is not then satisfied (treating such reinstatement as an 
L/C Credit Extension for purposes of this clause) and, in each case, 
directing the L/C Issuer not to permit such reinstatement.

(v)    Promptly after its delivery of any Letter of Credit or any amendment 
to a Letter of Credit to an advising bank with respect thereto or to the 
beneficiary thereof, the L/C Issuer will also deliver to the applicable 
Borrower and the Administrative Agent a true and complete copy of such 
Letter of Credit or amendment.

(c)    Drawings and Reimbursements; Funding of Participations.

(i)    Upon receipt from the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit of any 
notice of a drawing under such Letter of Credit, the L/C Issuer shall 
notify the applicable Borrower and the Administrative Agent thereof. Not 
later than (1) 1:00 p.m., Local Time, on the date that the L/C Issuer 
provides notice to the applicable Borrower of any payment by the L/C Issuer 
under a
 
84

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Letter of Credit denominated in Dollars or (2) 11:00 a.m., Local Time, on 
the next succeeding Business Day (if such notice is provided after 10:00 
a.m., Local Time, on the date such notice is given) (each such applicable 
date, an Honor Date), the applicable Borrower shall reimburse the L/C 
Issuer (and the L/C Issuer shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent 
of any failure by such Borrower to so reimburse the L/C Issuer by such 
time) in an amount equal to the amount of such drawing and in the 
applicable currency. If the applicable Borrower fails to so reimburse the 
L/C Issuer by such time, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify 
each Revolving Facility Lender under the Revolving Facility pursuant to 
which such Letter of Credit was issued of the Honor Date, the amount of the 
unreimbursed drawing (the Unreimbursed Amount), and the amount of such 
Lenders Revolving Facility Percentage thereof. In such event, the 
applicable Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a Borrowing of ABR 
Revolving Loans under the Revolving Facility under which such Letter of 
Credit was issued to be disbursed on the Honor Date in an amount equal to 
the Unreimbursed Amount, without regard to the minimum Borrowing Minimums 
or Borrowing Multiples, but subject to the amount of the unutilized portion 
of the Revolving Facility Commitments under such Revolving Facility and the 
conditions set forth in Section 4.01 (other than the delivery of a 
Borrowing Request). Any notice given by the L/C Issuer or the 
Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 2.05(c)(i) may be given by 
telephone if immediately confirmed in writing; provided that the lack of 
such an immediate confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness or 
binding effect of such notice.

(ii)    Each Revolving Facility Lender under the Revolving Facility under 
which such Letter of Credit was issued shall upon any notice pursuant to 
Section 2.05(c)(i) make funds available to the Administrative Agent for the 
account of the L/C Issuer, in Dollars, at the Administrative Agents Office 
for Dollar-denominated payments in an amount equal to its Revolving 
Facility Percentage under such Revolving Facility of the Unreimbursed 
Amount not later than 1:00 p.m. on the Business Day specified in such 
notice by the Administrative Agent, whereupon, subject to the provisions of 
Section 2.05(c)(iii), each Revolving Facility Lender that so makes funds 
available shall be deemed to have made an ABR Revolving Loan under the 
applicable Revolving Facility to the applicable Borrower in such amount. 
The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the L/C 
Issuer in Dollars.

(iii)    With respect to any Unreimbursed Amount that is not fully 
refinanced by a Borrowing of ABR Revolving Loans because the conditions set 
forth in Section 4.01 cannot be satisfied or for any other reason, the 
applicable Borrower shall be deemed to have incurred from the L/C Issuer an 
L/C Borrowing under the applicable Revolving Facility in the amount of the 
Unreimbursed Amount that is not so refinanced, which L/C Borrowing shall be 
due and payable on demand (together with interest) and shall bear interest 
at the rate specified in Section 2.13(c). In such event, each Revolving 
Facility Lenders payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of 
the L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.05(c)(ii) shall be deemed payment in 
respect of its participation in such L/C Borrowing and shall constitute an 
L/C Advance from such Revolving Facility Lender under the applicable 
Revolving Facility in satisfaction of its participation obligation under 
this Section 2.05.

(iv)    Until each Revolving Facility Lender under the applicable Revolving 
Facility funds its ABR Revolving Loan or L/C Advance pursuant to this 
Section 2.05(c) to reimburse the L/C Issuer for any amount drawn under any 
Letter of Credit, interest in respect of such Lenders Revolving Facility 
Percentage of such amount shall be solely for the account of the L/C 
Issuer.
 
85

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(v)    Each Revolving Facility Lenders obligation to make ABR Revolving 
Loans or L/C Advances to reimburse the L/C Issuer for amounts drawn under 
Letters of Credit under a revolvingRevolving Facility under which such 
Lender has a Revolving Facility Commitment, as contemplated by this Section 
2.05(c), shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by 
any circumstance, including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, 
defense or other right which such Revolving Facility Lender may have 
against the L/C Issuer, any Borrower, any Subsidiary or any other person 
for any reason whatsoever; (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, 
or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to 
any of the foregoing; provided, however, that each Lenders obligation to 
make ABR Revolving Loans pursuant to this Section 2.05(c) is subject to the 
conditions set forth in Section 4.01 (other than delivery by a Borrower of 
a Borrowing Request). No such making of an L/C Advance shall relieve or 
otherwise impair the obligation of any Borrower to reimburse the L/C Issuer 
for the amount of any payment made by the L/C Issuer under any Letter of 
Credit, together with interest as provided herein.

(vi)    If any Revolving Facility Lender under the applicable Revolving 
Facility fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the 
account of the L/C Issuer any amount required to be paid by such Lender 
pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.05(c) by the time 
specified in Section 2.05(c)(ii), the L/C Issuer shall be entitled to 
recover from such Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on 
demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such 
payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately 
available to the L/C Issuer at a rate per annum equal to the applicable 
Overnight Rate from time to time in effect, plus any administrative, 
processing or similar fees customarily charged by the L/C Issuer in 
connection with the foregoing. If such Lender pays such amount (with 
interest and fees as aforesaid), the amount so paid shall constitute such 
Lenders ABR Revolving Loan included in the relevant Borrowing or L/C 
Advance in respect of the relevant L/C Borrowing, as the case may be. A 
certificate of the L/C Issuer submitted to any Revolving Facility Lender 
(through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under 
this clause (vi) shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

(d)    Repayment of Participations.

(i)    At any time after the L/C Issuer has made a payment under any Letter 
of Credit and has received from any Revolving Facility Lender such 
Revolving Facility Lenders L/C Advance in respect of such payment in 
accordance with Section 2.05(c), if the Administrative Agent receives for 
the account of the L/C Issuer any payment in respect of the related 
Unreimbursed Amount or interest thereon (whether directly from a Borrower 
or otherwise, including proceeds of Cash Collateral applied thereto by the 
Administrative Agent), the Administrative Agent will distribute to such 
Revolving Facility Lender its Revolving Facility Percentage thereof under 
the applicable Revolving Facility in Dollars and in the same funds as those 
received by the Administrative Agent.

(ii)    If any payment received by the Administrative Agent for the account 
of the L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.05(c)(i) in connection with the 
issuance of any Letter of
 
86

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Credit under any Revolving Facility is required to be returned under any of 
the circumstances described in Section 8.10 (including pursuant to any 
settlement entered into by the L/C Issuer in its discretion), each 
Revolving Facility Lender under such Revolving Facility shall pay to the 
Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer its Revolving 
Facility Percentage under such Revolving Facility thereof on demand of the 
Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to 
the date such amount is returned by such Revolving Facility Lender, at a 
rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in 
effect. The obligations of the Revolving Facility Lenders under this clause 
shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of 
this Agreement.

(e)    Obligations Absolute. The obligation of a Borrower to reimburse the 
L/C Issuer for each drawing under each Letter of Credit and to repay each 
L/C Borrowing shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall 
be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under all 
circumstances, including the following:

(i)    any lack of validity or enforceability of such Letter of Credit, 
this Agreement, or any other Loan Document;

(ii)    the existence of any claim, counterclaim, setoff, defense or other 
right that any Borrower or any Subsidiary may have at any time against any 
beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit (or any person for 
whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), the L/C 
Issuer or any other person, whether in connection with this Agreement, the 
transactions contemplated hereby or by such Letter of Credit or any 
agreement or instrument relating thereto, or any unrelated transaction;

(iii)    any draft, demand, certificate or other document presented under 
such Letter of Credit that appears on its face to be valid proving to be 
forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement 
therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect; or any loss or delay in 
the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a 
drawing under such Letter of Credit;

(iv)    any payment by the L/C Issuer under such Letter of Credit against 
presentation of a draft or certificate that does not strictly comply with 
the terms of such Letter of Credit; or any payment made by the L/C Issuer 
under such Letter of Credit to any person purporting to be a trustee in 
bankruptcy, debtor-in-possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors, 
liquidator, receiver or other representative of or successor to any 
beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit, including any 
arising in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law; or

(v)    any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not 
similar to any of the foregoing, including any other circumstance that 
might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, any 
Borrower or any Subsidiary.

Each Borrower shall promptly examine a copy of each Letter of Credit and 
each amendment thereto that is delivered to it and, in the event of any 
claim of noncompliance with such Borrowers instructions or other 
irregularity, such Borrower will immediately notify the L/C Issuer. Each 
Borrower shall be conclusively deemed to have waived any such claim against 
the L/C Issuer and its correspondents unless such notice is given as 
aforesaid.
 
87

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(f)    Role of L/C Issuer. Each Revolving Facility Lender and each Borrower 
agree that, in paying any drawing under a Letter of Credit, the L/C Issuer 
shall not have any responsibility to obtain any document (other than any 
sight draft, certificates and documents expressly required by the Letter of 
Credit) or to ascertain or inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any 
such document or the authority of the person executing or delivering any 
such document. None of the L/C Issuer, the Administrative Agent, any of 
their respective Related Parties nor any correspondent, participant or 
assignee of the L/C Issuer shall be liable to any Lender for (i) any action 
taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or with the approval 
of the Revolving Facility Lenders or the Majority Lenders under the 
Revolving Facility under which such Letter of Credit was issued, as 
applicable; (ii) any action taken or omitted in the absence of gross 
negligence or willful misconduct; or (iii) the due execution, 
effectiveness, validity or enforceability of any document or instrument 
related to any Letter of Credit or Issuer Document. Each Borrower hereby 
assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee 
with respect to its use of any Letter of Credit; provided, however, that 
this assumption is not intended to, and shall not, preclude such Borrowers 
pursuing such rights and remedies as it may have against the beneficiary or 
transferee at law or under any other agreement. None of the L/C Issuer, the 
Administrative Agent, any of their respective Related Parties nor any 
correspondent, participant or assignee of the L/C Issuer shall be liable or 
responsible for any of the matters described in clauses (i) through (v) of 
Section 2.05(e); provided, however, that anything in such clauses to the 
contrary notwithstanding, such Borrower may have a claim against the L/C 
Issuer, and the L/C Issuer may be liable to such Borrower, to the extent, 
but only to the extent, of any direct, as opposed to consequential or 
exemplary, damages suffered by such Borrower which such Borrower proves 
were caused by the L/C Issuers willful misconduct or gross negligence or 
the L/C Issuers willful failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after 
the presentation to it by the beneficiary of a sight draft and 
certificate(s) strictly complying with the terms and conditions of a Letter 
of Credit. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the L/C 
Issuer may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, 
without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice 
or information to the contrary, and the L/C Issuer shall not be responsible 
for the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning 
or purporting to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or 
benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may 
prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason.

(g)    Cash Collateral.

(i)    Upon the request of the Administrative Agent if, as of the Letter of 
Credit Expiration Date, any L/C Obligation for any reason remains 
outstanding, the applicable Borrower shall promptly Cash Collateralize the 
then Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations.

(ii)    Sections 2.11(d), 2.22 and 7.01 set forth certain additional 
requirements to deliver Cash Collateral hereunder. For purposes of Sections 
2.05, 2.11(d), 2.22 and 7.01, Cash Collateralize means to pledge and 
deposit with or deliver to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the 
L/C Issuer and the Revolving Facility Lenders, as collateral for the L/C 
Obligations, cash or deposit account balances, in each case, pursuant to 
documentation in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the 
Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer (which
 
88

------------------------------------------------------------------------
documents are hereby consented to by the Lenders). Derivatives of such term 
have corresponding meanings. Each of the Borrowers hereby grants to the 
Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the L/C Issuer and the Revolving 
Facility Lenders under any Revolving Facility under which a Letter of 
Credit is Cash Collateralized, a security interest in all such cash, 
deposit accounts and all balances therein and all proceeds of the 
foregoing. Except as otherwise agreed to by the Administrative Agent, Cash 
Collateral shall be maintained in blocked, non-interest bearing deposit 
accounts at Citibank.

(h)    Applicability of ISP and UCP. Unless otherwise expressly agreed by 
the L/C Issuer and the applicable Borrower when a Letter of Credit is 
issued (including any such agreement applicable to an Existing Letter of 
Credit), (i) the rules of the ISP shall apply to each standby Letter of 
Credit, and (ii) the rules of the Uniform Customs and Practice for 
Documentary Credits, as most recently published by the International 
Chamber of Commerce at the time of issuance shall apply to each commercial 
Letter of Credit.

(i)    Conflict with Issuer Documents. In the event of any conflict between 
the terms hereof and the terms of any Issuer Document, the terms hereof 
shall control.

(j)    Letters of Credit Issued for Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding that a 
Letter of Credit issued or outstanding hereunder is in support of any 
obligations of, or is for the account of, a Subsidiary, the applicable 
Borrower shall be obligated to reimburse the L/C Issuer hereunder for any 
and all drawings under such Letter of Credit. Each of the Borrowers hereby 
acknowledges that the issuance of Letters of Credit for the account of 
Subsidiaries inures to the benefit of such Borrower, and that the 
Borrowers business derives substantial benefits from the businesses of 
such Subsidiaries.

(k)    Additional L/C Issuers. From time to time, any Borrower may by 
notice to the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Administrative 
Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and the 
applicable Revolving Facility Lender designate such Revolving Facility 
Lender (in addition to Citibank) to act as an L/C Issuer hereunder. In the 
event that there shall be more than one L/C Issuer hereunder, each 
reference to the L/C Issuer hereunder with respect to any L/C Issuer 
shall refer to the person that issued such Letter of Credit and each such 
additional L/C Issuer shall be entitled to the benefits of this Agreement 
as an L/C Issuer to the same extent as if it had been originally named as 
the L/C Issuer hereunder. Promptly after its delivery of any Letter of 
Credit or any amendment to a Letter of Credit (including any Existing 
Letter of Credit) to an advising bank with respect thereto or to the 
beneficiary thereof, each L/C Issuer (other than Citibank) will also 
deliver to the Administrative Agent a true and complete copy of such Letter 
of Credit or amendment. On the last Business Day of each March, June, 
September and December (and on such other dates as the Administrative Agent 
may request), each L/C Issuer shall provide the Administrative Agent a list 
of all Letters of Credit (including any Existing Letter of Credit) issued 
by it that are outstanding at such time together with such other 
information as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request.
 
89

------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 2.06.    Funding of Borrowings.

(a)    Each Lender shall make each Term Loan or Revolving Facility Loan to 
be made by it hereunder available to the Administrative Agent in Same Day 
Funds at the Administrative Agents Office for the applicable currency not 
later than (i) 12:00 p.m., Local Time, in the case of any ABR Loan 
denominated in Dollars and (ii) 10:00 a.m., Local Time, in the case of any 
Eurocurrency Loan denominated in Dollars, in each case, on the Business Day 
specified in the applicable Borrowing Request. The Administrative Agent 
will make such Loans available to the Borrowers by promptly crediting the 
amounts so received, in like funds, to an account of the applicable 
Borrower as specified in the Borrowing Request; provided, however, that if, 
on the date the Borrowing Request with respect to a Revolving Facility 
Borrowing denominated in Dollars is given by a Borrower, there are L/C 
Borrowings outstanding under the applicable Revolving Facility, then the 
proceeds of such Borrowing, first, shall be applied to the payment in full 
of any such L/C Borrowings, and, second, shall be made available to the 
applicable Borrower as provided above.

(b)    Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a 
Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing of Eurocurrency Loans 
(or, in the case of any Borrowing of ABR Loans, prior to 9:00 a.m., Local 
Time, on the date of such Borrowing) that such Lender will not make 
available to the Administrative Agent such Lenders share of such 
Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made 
such share available on such date in accordance with Section 2.06(a) (or, 
in the case of a Borrowing of ABR Loans, that such Lender has made such 
share available in accordance with and at the time required by Section 
2.06(a)) and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the 
applicable Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has 
not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the 
Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the applicable 
Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on 
demand such corresponding amount in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, 
for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to 
the applicable Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the 
Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such 
Lender, the Overnight Rate, plus any administrative, processing or similar 
fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the 
foregoing, and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by the applicable 
Borrower, the interest rate applicable to ABR Loans under the applicable 
Facility. If the applicable Borrower and such Lender shall pay such 
interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, 
the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the applicable Borrower 
the amount of such interest paid by the applicable Borrower for such 
period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to the 
Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such 
Lenders Loan included in such Borrowing. Any payment by any Borrower shall 
be without prejudice to any claim such Borrower may have against a Lender 
that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.

SECTION 2.07.    Interest Elections.

(a)    Each Borrowing of Revolving Facility Loans or Term Loans initially 
shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in 
the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period 
as specified in such Borrowing Request.
 
90

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thereafter, a Borrower may elect to convert such Borrowing to a different 
Type or to continue such Borrowing and, in the case of a Eurocurrency 
Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this 
Section; provided, that except as otherwise provided herein, a Eurocurrency 
Loan may be continued or converted only on the last day of an Interest 
Period for such Eurocurrency Loan. A Borrower may elect different options 
with respect to different portions of the affected Revolving Facility 
Borrowing or Term Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be 
allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such 
Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a 
separate Borrowing.

(b)    To make an election pursuant to this Section, a Borrower shall 
notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone by the time 
that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if such 
Borrower were requesting a Borrowing of the Type resulting from such 
election to be made on the effective date of such election. Each such 
telephonic Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be 
confirmed promptly by hand delivery or electronic means to the 
Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election Request in the form of 
Exhibit D and signed by a Responsible Officer of such Borrower.

(c)    Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall be 
irrevocable and shall specify the following information in compliance with 
Section 2.02:

(i)    the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, 
if different options are being elected with respect to different portions 
thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing 
(in which case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) 
and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing);

(ii)    the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest 
Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;

(iii)    whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a 
Eurocurrency Borrowing; and

(iv)    if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurocurrency Borrowing, the 
Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such 
election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the 
term Interest Period.

If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurocurrency Borrowing but 
does not specify an Interest Period, then the applicable Borrower shall be 
deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one months duration.

(d)    Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the 
Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender to which such Interest 
Election Request relates of the details thereof and of such Lenders 
portion of each resulting Borrowing.

(e)    If the applicable Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest 
Election Request with respect to a Eurocurrency Borrowing prior to the end 
of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is 
repaid as provided herein, at the end of such
 
91

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Interest Period such Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing. 
Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has 
occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the written 
request (including a request through electronic means) of the Required 
Lenders, so notifies the applicable Borrower, then, so long as an Event of 
Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Borrowing denominated in Dollars 
may be converted to or continued as a Eurocurrency Borrowing, (ii) unless 
repaid, each Eurocurrency Borrowing denominated in Dollars shall be 
converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable 
thereto and (iii) each Eurocurrency Revolving Facility Borrowing shall, 
unless repaid, be continued as a Eurocurrency Revolving Facility Borrowing 
with an Interest Period of one months duration.

SECTION 2.08.    Termination and Reduction of Commitments.

(a)    Unless previously terminated, the Revolving Facility Commitments of 
any Class shall terminate on the Revolving Facility Maturity Date with 
respect to such Class.

(b)    Any Borrower may at any time terminate, or from time to time reduce, 
the Revolving Facility Commitments of any Class; provided, that (i) each 
such reduction of the Revolving Facility Commitments of any Class shall be 
in an amount that is an integral multiple of $1.0 million and not less than 
$5.0 million (or, if less, the remaining amount of such Class of Revolving 
Facility Commitments) and (ii) no Borrower shall terminate or reduce the 
Revolving Facility Commitments of any Class if, after giving effect to any 
concurrent prepayment of the Revolving Facility Loans in accordance with 
Section 2.11 under such Revolving Facility, the Revolving Facility Credit 
Exposure of such Class (excluding any Cash Collateralized Letter of Credit) 
would exceed the total Revolving Facility Commitments of such Class.

(c)    The applicable Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any 
election to terminate or reduce the Revolving Facility Commitments of any 
Class under clause (b) of this Section at least three Business Days prior 
to the effective date of such termination or reduction (or such shorter 
period acceptable to the Administrative Agent), specifying such election 
and the effective date thereof. Promptly following receipt of any notice, 
the Administrative Agent shall advise the applicable Lenders of the 
contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the applicable Borrower pursuant 
to this Section shall be irrevocable; provided, that a notice of 
termination or reduction of the Revolving Facility Commitments of any Class 
delivered by the applicable Borrower may state that such notice is 
conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, indentures 
or similar agreements or other transactions, in which case such notice may 
be revoked by the applicable Borrower (by notice to the Administrative 
Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not 
satisfied. Any termination or reduction of the Commitments shall be 
permanent. Each reduction of the Commitments of a Class shall be made 
ratably among the applicable Lenders in accordance with their respective 
Commitments of such Class.

SECTION 2.09.    Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt.

(a)    Each of the Borrowers hereby unconditionally promises to pay (i) to 
the Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Facility Lender 
under each Revolving Facility the then unpaid principal amount of each 
Revolving Facility Loan under such Revolving
 
92

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Facility on the Revolving Facility Maturity Date with respect to such 
Revolving Facility, (ii) to the Administrative Agent for the account of 
each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Term Loan of such 
Lender as provided in Section 2.10 and (iii) to the Swingline Lender the 
then unpaid principal amount of each Swingline Loan under any Revolving 
Facility on the Revolving Facility Maturity Date with respect to such 
Revolving Facility.

(b)    Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an 
account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrowers to such 
Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts 
of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time 
hereunder.

(c)    The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall 
record (i) the amount and currency of each Loan made hereunder, the 
Facility and Type thereof and the Interest Period (if any) applicable 
thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to 
become due and payable from each Borrower to each Lender hereunder and 
(iii) any amount received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the 
account of the Lenders and each Lenders share thereof.

(d)    The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraph 
(b) or (c) of this Section shall be prima facie evidence of the existence 
and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; provided, that the failure 
of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any 
error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of any Borrower 
to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

(e)    Any Lender may request that Loans of any Class made by it be 
evidenced by a promissory note (a Note). In such event, the Borrowers 
shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable 
to the order of such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such 
Lender and its registered assigns) and in a form approved by the 
Administrative Agent and reasonably acceptable to the Company. Thereafter, 
unless otherwise agreed to by the applicable Lender, the Loans evidenced by 
such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including 
after assignment pursuant to Section 9.04) be represented by one or more 
promissory notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named 
therein (or, if requested by such payee, to such payee and its registered 
assigns).

SECTION 2.10.    Repayment of Term Loans and Revolving Facility Loans.

(a)    Subject to the other paragraphs of this Section,

(i)    the Borrowers shall repay Term B Borrowings on the last day of each 
March, June, September and December of each year (commencing on the last 
day of the first full fiscal quarter of the Borrowers after the Closing 
Date) and on the applicable Term Facility Maturity Date, or, if such date 
is not a Business Day, the next preceding Business Day (each such date 
being referred to as a Term B Loan Installment Date), in an aggregate 
principal amount of the Term B Loans equal to (A) in the case of quarterly 
payments due prior to the applicable Term Facility Maturity Date, an amount 
equal to 0.25(x) for each fiscal quarter ending on or before September 30, 
2018, 0.25% of the aggregate principal amount of Term B Loans outstanding 
on the Closing Date, (y)
 
93

------------------------------------------------------------------------
for each subsequent fiscal quarter ending on or before September 30, 2019, 
0.625% of the aggregate principal amount of Term B Loans outstanding on the 
Closing Date and (z) for each subsequent fiscal quarter, 1.25% of the 
aggregate principal amount of Term B Loans outstanding on the Closing Date, 
and (B) in the case of such payment due on the applicable Term Facility 
Maturity Date, an amount equal to the then unpaid principal amount of the 
Term B Loans outstanding;

(ii)    in the event that any Incremental Term Loans are made on an 
Increased Amount Date, the Borrowers shall repay such Incremental Term 
Loans on the dates and in the amounts set forth in the related Incremental 
Assumption Agreement (each such date being referred to as an Incremental 
Term Loan Installment Date);

(iii)    to the extent not previously paid, outstanding Term Loans shall be 
due and payable on the applicable Term Facility Maturity Date.

(b)    To the extent not previously paid, outstanding Revolving Facility 
Loans of any Class shall be due and payable on the Revolving Facility 
Maturity Date with respect to such Class.

(c)    Prepayment of the Term Loans from:

(i)    all Net Proceeds pursuant to Section 2.11(b) and Excess Cash Flow 
pursuant to Section 2.11(c) shall be applied to the Term Loans pro rata 
among each Term Facility, with the application thereof being applied to the 
remaining installments thereof as the Company may direct; provided that, 
subject to the pro rata application to Loans outstanding within any Class 
of Term Loans, the Company may allocate such prepayment in its sole 
discretion among the Class or Classes of Term Loans as the Company may 
specify (so long as the initial Term B Loans incurred on the Closing Date 
are allocated at least their pro rata share of such prepayment);

(ii)    any optional prepayments of the Term Loans pursuant to Section 
2.11(a) shall be applied to the remaining installments of the Term Loans as 
the Company may direct under the applicable Class or Classes as the Company 
may direct; and

(iii)    any prepayment of Term Loans of a particular Class pursuant to 
Section 2.11(g) or 9.04(i) shall be applied to the remaining installments 
of such Class of Term Loans on a pro rata basis.

(d)    Any mandatory prepayment of Term Loans pursuant to Section 2.11(b) 
or (c) shall be applied so that the aggregate amount of such prepayment is 
allocated among the Term Loans in the applicable Class or Classes of Term 
Loans (including Refinancing Term Loans and Other Term Loans, if any) to be 
repaid, pro rata based on the aggregate principal amount of outstanding 
Term Loans in the applicable Class or Classes, irrespective of whether such 
outstanding Term Loans are ABR Loans or Eurocurrency Loans (other than with 
respect to Other Term Loans or Refinancing Term Loans, to the extent the 
Incremental Assumption Agreement relating thereto does not so require); 
provided that if no Lenders exercise the right to waive a given mandatory 
prepayment of the Term Loans pursuant to Section 2.11(e), then, with 
respect to such mandatory prepayment, prior to the repayment of any Term 
Loan, the Company
 
94

------------------------------------------------------------------------
may select the Borrowing or Borrowings to be prepaid and shall notify the 
Administrative Agent by telephone (confirmed by electronic means) of such 
selection not later than 12:00 p.m., Local Time, (i) in the case of an ABR 
Borrowing, at least one Business Day before the scheduled date of such 
prepayment and (ii) in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, at least three 
Business Days before the scheduled date of such prepayment (or, in each 
case, such shorter period acceptable to the Administrative Agent); 
provided, that a notice of prepayment may state that such notice is 
conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, indentures 
or similar agreements or other transactions, in each case such notice may 
be revoked by the Borrowers (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or 
prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied. 
Repayments of Eurocurrency Borrowings pursuant to this Section 2.10 shall 
be accompanied by accrued interest on the amount repaid to the extent 
required by Section 2.13(d).

SECTION 2.11.    Prepayment of Loans.

(a)    (i) Any Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to 
time to prepay any Loan in whole or in part, without premium or penalty

Section 2.16), in an aggregate principal amount that is an integral 
multiple of the Borrowing Multiple and not less than the Borrowing Minimum 
or, if less, the amount outstanding, upon prior notice in accordance with 
Section 2.10(d). Each such notice shall be signed by a Responsible Officer 
of the Company and shall specify the date and amount of such prepayment and 
the Class(es) and the Type(s) of Loans to be prepaid and, if Eurocurrency 
Loans are to be prepaid, the Interest Period(s) of such Loans. The 
Administrative Agent will promptly notify each applicable Lender of its 
receipt of each such notice, and of the amount of such Lenders pro rata 
share of such prepayment.

(ii)    Each voluntary prepayment of Term B Loans pursuant to this Section 
2.11(a) shall be subject to the following:

(1)    in the event of any voluntary prepayments of the Term B Loans 
pursuant to this Section 2.11(a) made prior to the first anniversary of the 
Closing Date, the applicable Borrower shall pay, or cause to be paid, to 
the applicable Lenders with respect to such Term B Loans a prepayment 
premium equal to the Applicable Premium on such date on the aggregate 
principal amount of the Term B Loans so prepaid; and

(2ii)    inIn the event of any voluntary prepaymentsthat, on or prior to 
the date that is six months after the First Amendment Effective Date, the 
Borrowers shall (x) make a prepayment of the Term B Loans pursuant to this 
Section 2.11(a) made on or after the first anniversary of the Closing Date 
and prior to the second anniversary of the Closing Date, the applicable 
Borrower shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the applicable Lenders with 
respect to such Term B Loanswith the proceeds of, or any conversion of Term 
B Loans into, any substantially concurrent issuance solely by the Borrowers 
of a new or replacement tranche of long-term senior secured first lien term 
loans incurred solely by the Borrowers that are broadly syndicated to banks 
and other institutional investors in financings similar to the Term B Loans 
the primary purpose of which is to (and which does) reduce the All-in 
Yield of such Term B Loans (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, with 
respect

------------------------------------------------------------------------
to securitizations) or (y) effect any amendment to this Agreement the 
primary purpose of which is to (and which does) reduce the All-in Yield of 
the Term B Loans (other than, in the case of each of clauses (x) and (y), 
in connection with a Qualified IPO, a Change in Control or a transformative 
acquisition referred to in the last sentence of this paragraph), the 
Borrowers shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for the ratable account of 
each of the applicable Lenders holding Term B Loans, (A) in the case of 
clause (x), a prepayment premium equal to 2of 1.00% of the aggregate 
principal amount of the Term B Loans so prepaid; and

(3B) in the event of any voluntary prepayments of the Term B Loans pursuant 
to this Section 2.11(a) made on or after the second anniversary of the 
Closing Date and prior to the third anniversary of the Closing Date, the 
applicable Borrower shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the applicable 
Lenders with respect to such Term B Loans a prepayment premium equal to 1% 
of the aggregate amount of the Term B Loans so prepaid. No premium shall be 
payable on or after the third anniversary of the Closing Date.case of 
clause (y), a fee equal to 1.00% of the aggregate principal amount of the 
applicable Term B Loans for which the All-in Yield has been reduced 
pursuant to such amendment. Such amounts shall be due and payable on the 
date of such prepayment or the effective date of such amendment, as the 
case may be. For purposes of this Section 2.11(a)(ii), a transformative 
acquisition is any acquisition by any Borrower or any Subsidiary that (i) 
is not permitted by the terms of the Loan Documents immediately prior to 
the consummation of such acquisition or (ii) if permitted by the terms of 
the Loan Documents immediately prior to the consummation of such 
acquisition, would not provide the Borrowers and their Subsidiaries with 
adequate flexibility under the Loan Documents for the continuation and/or 
expansion of their combined operations following such consummation, as 
determined by the Borrowers in good faith.

(b)    Subject to Section 2.11(e) and (f), the Borrowers shall apply all 
Net Proceeds promptly upon receipt thereof to prepay Term Loans in 
accordance with clauses (c) and (d) of Section 2.10; provided that, with 
respect to Net Proceeds from Asset Sales, the Borrowers may use a portion 
of such Net Proceeds to prepay or repurchase any First Lien Notes or other 
Indebtedness that is secured by pari passu Liens on the Collateral 
permitted by Section 6.02, in each case in an amount not to exceed the 
product of (x) the amount of such Net Proceeds multiplied by (y) a 
fraction, (A) the numerator of which is the outstanding principal amount of 
such Indebtedness with a pari passu lien on the Collateral and (B) the 
denominator of which is the sum of the outstanding principal amount of such 
Indebtedness and the outstanding principal amount of all Classes of Term 
Loans.

(c)    Subject to Section 2.11(e) and (f), within five (5) Business Days 
after financial statements are delivered under Section 5.04(a) with respect 
to each Excess Cash Flow Period, the Borrowers shall calculate Excess Cash 
Flow for such Excess Cash Flow Period and shall apply an amount equal to 
(i) the amount by which the Required Percentage of such Excess Cash Flow 
exceeds $5.0 million, minus (ii) the sum of (A) the amount of any voluntary 
prepayments during such Excess Cash Flow Period (plus, without duplication 
of any amounts previously deducted under this clause (A), the amount of any 
voluntary prepayments after the end of such Excess Cash Flow Period but 
before the date of prepayment under this clause (c)) of Term Loans and (B) 
the amount of any permanent voluntary reductions during such Excess Cash
 
96

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Flow Period (plus, without duplication of any amounts previously deducted 
under this clause (B), the amount of any permanent voluntary reductions 
after the end of such Excess Cash Flow Period but before the date of 
prepayment under this clause (c)) of Revolving Facility Commitments to the 
extent that an equal amount of Revolving Facility Loans was simultaneously 
repaid, to prepay Term Loans in accordance with clauses (c) and (d) of 
Section 2.10. Not later than the date on which the payment is required to 
be made pursuant to the foregoing sentence for each applicable Excess Cash 
Flow Period, the Company will deliver to the Administrative Agent a 
certificate signed by a Financial Officer of the Company setting forth the 
amount, if any, of Excess Cash Flow for such fiscal year, the amount of any 
required prepayment in respect thereof and the calculation thereof in 
reasonable detail.

(d)    If the Administrative Agent notifies the applicable Borrower at any 
time that the Revolving Facility Credit Exposure for any Revolving Facility 
at such time exceedexceeds an amount equal to 105% of the Revolving 
Facility Commitments then in effect under such Revolving Facility, then, 
within two Business Days after receipt of such notice, the applicable 
Borrower shall (at such Borrowers option) prepay Revolving Facility Loans 
and/or the Swingline Loans and/or such Borrower shall Cash Collateralize 
the L/C Obligations, in each case, under such Revolving Facility, in an 
aggregate amount sufficient to reduce the Revolving Facility Credit 
Exposure under such Revolving Facility as of such date of payment to an 
amount not to exceed 100% of the Revolving Facility Commitments then in 
effect under such Revolving Facility. The Administrative Agent may, at any 
time and from time to time after any such initial deposit of such Cash 
Collateral, request that additional Cash Collateral be provided in order to 
protect against the results of further exchange rate fluctuations.

(e)    Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, in the 
event a Borrower is required to make any mandatory prepayment (a Waivable 
Mandatory Prepayment) of the Term Loans, not less than three Business Days 
prior to the date (the Required Prepayment Date) on which such Borrower 
elects (or is otherwise required) to make such Waivable Mandatory 
Prepayment, such Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of the 
amount of such prepayment, and the Administrative Agent will promptly 
thereafter notify each Lender holding an outstanding Term Loan of the 
amount of such Lenders pro rata share of such Waivable Mandatory 
Prepayment and such Lenders option to refuse such amount. Each such Lender 
may exercise such option by giving written notice to the Administrative 
Agent of its election to do so on or before the second Business Day prior 
to the Required Prepayment Date (it being understood that any Lender which 
does not notify the Administrative Agent of its election to exercise such 
option on or before the first Business Day prior to the Required Prepayment 
Date shall be deemed to have elected, as of such date, not to exercise such 
option). On the Required Prepayment Date, the applicable Borrower shall pay 
to the Administrative Agent the amount of the Waivable Mandatory Prepayment 
less the amount of Declined Proceeds, which amount shall be applied by the 
Administrative Agent to prepay the Term Loans of those Lenders that have 
elected to accept such Waivable Mandatory Prepayment (each, an Accepting 
Lender) (which prepayment shall be applied to the scheduled installments 
of principal of the Term Loans in the applicable Class(es) of Term Loans in 
accordance with paragraphs (c) and (d) of Section 2.10), and (ii) the 
Borrowers may retain a portion of the Waivable Mandatory Prepayment in an 
amount equal to that portion of the Waivable Mandatory Prepayment otherwise 
payable to those Lenders that have elected to exercise such option and 
decline such Waivable Mandatory Prepayment (such declined amounts, the 
Declined Proceeds). Such Declined Proceeds shall be retained by the 
Borrowers and may be used for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by this 
Agreement.
 
97

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(f)    Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section 2.11 to the 
contrary, (i) to the extent that any Net Proceeds of any Asset Sale by a 
Foreign Subsidiary or Excess Cash Flow attributable to a Foreign Subsidiary 
is prohibited or delayed by applicable local law from being repatriated to 
the United States, the portion of such Net Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow so 
affected will not be required to be applied to repay Term Loans at the 
times provided in Section 2.11(b) or Section 2.11(c) but may be retained by 
the applicable Foreign Subsidiary so long, but only so long, as the 
applicable local law will not permit repatriation to the United States (the 
Borrowers hereby agreeing to cause the applicable Foreign Subsidiary to 
promptly use commercially reasonable efforts to take all actions reasonably 
required by the applicable local law to permit such repatriation), and once 
such repatriation of any of such affected Net Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow 
is permitted under the applicable local law, such repatriation will be 
effected and such repatriated Net Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow will be 
promptly applied (net of additional taxes payable or reserved against as a 
result thereof) to the repayment of the Term Loans pursuant to Section 
2.11(b) or Section 2.11(c), to the extent provided herein and (ii) to the 
extent that the Borrowers have determined in good faith that repatriation 
of any or all of such Net Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow would have a 
material adverse tax cost consequence with respect to such Net Proceeds or 
Excess Cash Flow, the Net Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow so affected may be 
retained by the applicable Foreign Subsidiary; provided that, in the case 
of this clause (ii), on or before the date on which any Net Proceeds or 
Excess Cash Flow so retained would otherwise have been required to be 
applied to prepayments pursuant to Section 2.11(b) or Section 2.11(c), (x) 
the Borrowers apply an amount equal to such Net Proceeds or Excess Cash 
Flow to such prepayments as if such Net Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow had 
been received by the Borrowers rather than such Foreign Subsidiary, less 
the amount of additional taxes that would have been payable or reserved 
against if such Net Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow had been repatriated (or, 
if less, Net Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow that would be calculated if 
received by such Foreign Subsidiary) or (y) such Net Proceeds or Excess 
Cash Flow is applied to the permanent repayment of Indebtedness of a 
Foreign Subsidiary.

(g)    (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 2.11(a) or 
2.18(c) (which provisions shall not be applicable to this Section 2.11(g)), 
any Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to time to 
prepay Term Loans and/or repay Revolving Facility Loans of any Class (with, 
in the case of Revolving Facility Loans under any Revolving Facility, a 
corresponding permanent reduction in the Revolving Facility Commitment of 
each Lender who receives a Discounted Voluntary Prepayment), to the Lenders 
at a discount to the par value of such Loans and on a non pro rata basis 
(each, a Discounted Voluntary Prepayment) pursuant to the procedures 
described in this Section 2.11(g); provided that (A) any Discounted 
Voluntary Prepayment shall be offered to all Lenders with Term Loans of any 
Class and/or Revolving Facility Loans of any Class on a pro rata basis with 
all Lenders of such Class, and after giving effect to any Discounted 
Voluntary Prepayment, there shall be sufficient aggregate Revolving 
Facility Commitments among the Revolving Facility Lenders to apply to the 
Outstanding Amount of the L/C Obligations as of such date, unless the 
applicable Borrower shall concurrently with the payment of the purchase 
price by such Borrower for such Revolving Facility Loans, deposit cash 
collateral in an account with the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 
2.05(g) in the amount of any such excess Outstanding Amount of the L/C 
Obligations
 
98

------------------------------------------------------------------------
and (B) the Company shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a certificate 
of the Chief Financial Officer of the Company stating (1) that no Default 
or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or would result from the 
Discounted Voluntary Prepayment (after giving effect to any related waivers 
or amendments obtained in connection with such Discounted Voluntary 
Prepayment), (2) that each of the conditions to such Discounted Voluntary 
Prepayment contained in this Section 2.11(g) has been satisfied and (3) the 
aggregate principal amount of Term Loans and/or Revolving Facility Loans so 
prepaid pursuant to such Discounted Voluntary Prepayment.

(ii)    To the extent a Borrower seeks to make a Discounted Voluntary 
Prepayment, such Borrower will provide written notice to the Administrative 
Agent substantially in the form of Exhibit G (each, a Discounted 
Prepayment Option Notice) that such Borrower desires to prepay Term Loans 
and/or repay Revolving Facility Loans of an applicable Class (with a 
corresponding permanent reduction in Revolving Facility Commitments of such 
Class) in each case in an aggregate principal amount specified therein by 
such Borrower (each, a Proposed Discounted Prepayment Amount), in each 
case at a discount to the par value of such Term Loans and/or Revolving 
Facility Loans as specified below. The Proposed Discounted Prepayment 
Amount of Term Loans or Revolving Facility Loans shall not be less than 
$5.0 million. The Discounted Prepayment Option Notice shall further specify 
with respect to the proposed Discounted Voluntary Prepayment: (A) the 
Proposed Discounted Prepayment Amount for Term Loans and/or Revolving 
Facility Loans of the applicable Class, (B) a discount range (which may be 
a single percentage) selected by the applicable Borrower with respect to 
such proposed Discounted Voluntary Prepayment equal to a percentage of par 
of the principal amount of Term Loans or Revolving Facility Loans of such 
Class (the Discount Range) and (C) the date by which Lenders are required 
to indicate their election to participate in such proposed Discounted 
Voluntary Prepayment which shall be at least five Business Days following 
the date of the Discounted Prepayment Option Notice (the Acceptance Date
). Upon receipt of a Discounted Prepayment Option Notice with respect to 
Revolving Facility Loans, the Administrative Agent shall notify the L/C 
Issuer thereof and Discounted Voluntary Prepayments in respect thereof 
shall be subject to the consent of the L/C Issuer, such consent not to be 
unreasonably withheld or delayed.

(iii)    Upon receipt of a Discounted Prepayment Option Notice and receipt 
by the Administrative Agent of any required consent from the L/C Issuer in 
accordance with Section 2.11(g)(ii), the Administrative Agent shall 
promptly notify each Lender thereof. On or prior to the Acceptance Date, 
each such Lender may specify by written notice substantially in the form of 
Exhibit H (each, a Lender Participation Notice) to the Administrative 
Agent (A) a maximum discount to par (the Acceptable Discount) within the 
Discount Range (for example, a Lender specifying a discount to par of 20% 
would accept a purchase price of 80% of the par value of the Loans to be 
prepaid) and (B) a maximum principal amount (subject to rounding 
requirements specified by the Administrative Agent) of Term Loans and/or 
Revolving Facility Loans held by such Lender with respect to which such 
Lender is willing to permit a Discounted Voluntary Prepayment at the 
Acceptable Discount (Offered Loans). Based on the Acceptable Discounts 
and principal amounts of Term Loans and/or Revolving Facility Loans of the 
applicable Class(es) specified by the Lenders in the applicable Lender 
Participation Notice, the Administrative Agent, in consultation with the 
Company, shall determine the applicable discount for Term Loans and/or 
Revolving Facility Loans of the applicable Class(es) (the Applicable 
Discount), which Applicable Discount shall be (A) the percentage specified 
by the applicable
 
99

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Borrower if such Borrower has selected a single percentage pursuant to 
Section 2.11(g)(ii) for the Discounted Voluntary Prepayment or (B) 
otherwise, the highest Acceptable Discount at which such Borrower can pay 
the Proposed Discounted Prepayment Amount in full (determined by adding the 
principal amounts of Offered Loans commencing with the Offered Loans with 
the highest Acceptable Discount); provided, however, that in the event that 
such Proposed Discounted Prepayment Amount cannot be repaid in full at any 
Acceptable Discount, the Applicable Discount shall be the lowest Acceptable 
Discount specified by the Lenders that is within the Discount Range. The 
Applicable Discount shall be applicable for all Lenders who have offered to 
participate in the Discounted Voluntary Prepayment and have Qualifying 
Loans (as defined below). Any Lender with outstanding Loans whose Lender 
Participation Notice is not received by the Administrative Agent by the 
Acceptance Date shall be deemed to have declined to accept a Discounted 
Voluntary Prepayment of any of its Loans at any discount to their par value 
within the Applicable Discount.

(iv)    The applicable Borrower shall make a Discounted Voluntary 
Prepayment by prepaying those Term Loans and/or Revolving Facility Loans 
(or the respective portions thereof) (with, in the case of Revolving 
Facility Loans, a corresponding permanent reduction in Revolving Facility 
Commitments) of the applicable Class(es) offered by the Lenders (
Qualifying Lenders) that specify an Acceptable Discount that is equal to 
or greater than the Applicable Discount (Qualifying Loans) at the 
Applicable Discount; provided that if the aggregate proceeds required to 
prepay all Qualifying Loans (disregarding any interest payable at such 
time) would exceed the amount of aggregate proceeds required to prepay the 
Proposed Discounted Prepayment Amount, such amounts in each case calculated 
by applying the Applicable Discount, such Borrower shall prepay such 
Qualifying Loans ratably among the Qualifying Lenders based on their 
respective principal amounts of such Qualifying Loans (subject to rounding 
requirements specified by the Administrative Agent). If the aggregate 
proceeds required to prepay all Qualifying Loans (disregarding any interest 
payable at such time) would be less than the amount of aggregate proceeds 
required to prepay the Proposed Discounted Prepayment Amount, such amounts 
in each case calculated by applying the Applicable Discount, such Borrower 
shall prepay all Qualifying Loans.

(v)    Each Discounted Voluntary Prepayment shall be made within five 
Business Days of the Acceptance Date (or such later date as the 
Administrative Agent shall reasonably agree, given the time required to 
calculate the Applicable Discount and determine the amount and holders of 
Qualifying Loans), without premium or penalty (but subject to Section 
2.16), upon irrevocable notice substantially in the form of Exhibit I 
(each a Discounted Voluntary Prepayment Notice), delivered to the 
Administrative Agent no later than 1:00 P.M. Local time, three Business 
Days prior to the date of such Discounted Voluntary Prepayment, which 
notice shall specify the date and amount of the Discounted Voluntary 
Prepayment and the Applicable Discount determined by the Administrative 
Agent. Upon receipt of any Discounted Voluntary Prepayment Notice the 
Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each relevant Lender thereof. If 
any Discounted Voluntary Prepayment Notice is given, the amount specified 
in such notice shall be due and payable to the applicable Lenders, subject 
to the Applicable Discount on the applicable Loans, on the date specified 
therein together with accrued interest (on the par principal amount) to but 
not including such date on the amount prepaid.
 
100

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(vi)    To the extent not expressly provided for herein, each Discounted 
Voluntary Prepayment shall be consummated pursuant to reasonable procedures 
(including as to timing, rounding, minimum amounts, Type and Interest 
Periods and calculation of Applicable Discount in accordance with Section 
2.11(g)(iii) above) established by the Administrative Agent in consultation 
with the Company.

(vii)    Prior to the delivery of a Discounted Voluntary Prepayment Notice, 
upon written notice to the Administrative Agent, (A) any Borrower may 
withdraw its offer to make a Discounted Voluntary Prepayment pursuant to 
any Discounted Prepayment Option Notice and (B) any Lender may withdraw its 
offer to participate in a Discounted Voluntary Prepayment pursuant to any 
Lender Participation Notice.

SECTION 2.12.    Fees.

(a)    The Borrowers agree to pay to each Lender (other than any Defaulting 
Lender), through the Administrative Agent, on the date that is three 
Business Days after the last Business Day of March, June, September and 
December in each year, and the date on which the Revolving Facility 
Commitments of the applicable Class of such Lender shall be terminated as 
provided herein, a commitment fee in Dollars (a Commitment Fee) on the 
daily amount of the Available Unused Commitment of such Lender during the 
preceding quarter (or other period commencing with the Closing Date or 
ending with the date on which the last of the Commitments of such Lender 
shall be terminated) at a rate equal to the Applicable Commitment Fee for 
the applicable Class with respect to such Lender. All Commitment Fees shall 
be computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in a year of 
360 days. For the purpose of calculating any Lenders Commitment Fee (other 
than with respect to the Swingline Lender), the outstanding Swingline Loans 
during the period for which such Lenders Commitment Fee is calculated 
shall be deemed to be zero. The Commitment Fee due to each Lender shall 
commence to accrue on the Closing Date and shall cease to accrue on the 
date on which the last of the Commitments of such Lender shall be 
terminated as provided herein.

(b)    The Borrowers from time to time agree to pay (i) to each Revolving 
Facility Lender (other than any Defaulting Lender; provided that at any 
time that an L/C Issuer has Fronting Exposure to a Defaulting Lender, until 
such Fronting Exposure has been reduced to zero, the L/C Participation Fee 
attributable to such Fronting Exposure in respect of Letters of Credit 
issued by such L/C Issuer shall be payable to such L/C Issuer) under any 
Revolving Facility, through the Administrative Agent, three Business Days 
after the last day of March, June, September and December of each year and 
three Business Days after the date on which the Revolving Facility 
Commitments of all the Lenders under such Revolving Facility shall be 
terminated as provided herein, a fee (an L/C Participation Fee) on such 
Lenders Revolving Facility Percentage of the daily aggregate Outstanding 
Amount of L/C Obligations (excluding the portion thereof attributable to 
Unreimbursed Amounts) of such Class, during the preceding quarter (or 
shorter period commencing with the Closing Date or ending with the 
Revolving Facility Maturity Date with respect to such Revolving Facility or 
the date on which the Revolving Facility Commitments of such Class shall be 
terminated) at the rate per annum equal to the Applicable Margin for 
Eurocurrency Revolving Facility Borrowings of such Class made by such 
Lender effective for each day in such period and (ii) to each L/C Issuer, 
for its own account (x) three Business Days after the last Business Day of 
March, June, September and
 
101

------------------------------------------------------------------------
December of each year and on the date on which the Revolving Facility 
Commitments of all the Lenders under such Class shall be terminated as 
provided herein, a fronting fee in Dollars in respect of each Letter of 
Credit issued by such L/C Issuer for the period from and including the date 
of issuance of such Letter of Credit to and including the termination of 
such Letter of Credit, computed at a rate equal to 1/8 of 1% per annum of 
the daily stated amount of such Letter of Credit), plus (y) in connection 
with the issuance, amendment or transfer of any such Letter of Credit or 
any drawing thereunder, such L/C Issuers customary documentary and 
processing fees and charges (collectively, L/C Issuer Fees). All L/C 
Participation Fees and L/C Issuer Fees shall be computed on the basis of 
the actual number of days elapsed in a year of 360 days.

(c)    The Borrowers agree to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the 
account of the Administrative Agent, the agency fees set forth in the Fee 
Letter, as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time 
to time, at the times specified therein (the Administrative Agent Fees).

(d)    The Borrowers agree to pay on the Closing Date to each Term Lender 
party to this Agreement on the Closing Date, as fee compensation for the 
funding of such Lenders Term B Loan, a closing fee (the Term Closing Fee
) in an amount equal to 2.00% of the stated principal amount of such 
Lenders Term B Loan, payable to such Lender from the proceeds of its Term 
B Loan as and when funded on the Closing Date. Such Term Closing Fee will 
be in all respects fully earned, due and payable on the Closing Date and 
nonrefundable and non-creditable thereafter.

(e)    All Fees shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately available 
funds, to the Administrative Agent for distribution, if and as appropriate, 
among the Lenders, except that L/C Issuer Fees shall be paid directly to 
the applicable L/C Issuers. Once paid, none of the Fees shall be refundable 
under any circumstances.

SECTION 2.13.    Interest.

(a)    The Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing (including each Swingline 
Loan) shall bear interest at the ABR plus the Applicable Margin.

(b)    The Loans comprising each Eurocurrency Borrowing shall bear interest 
at the Adjusted Eurocurrency Rate for the Interest Period in effect for 
such Borrowing plus the Applicable Margin.

(c)    Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest on 
any Loan or any Fees or other amount payable by a Borrower hereunder is not 
paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, 
such overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, 
at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal of any 
Loan, 2% plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided in the 
preceding paragraphs of this Section or (ii) in the case of any other 
overdue amount, 2% plus the rate applicable to ABR Loans as provided in 
paragraph (a) of this Section; provided, that this paragraph (c) shall not 
apply to any Event of Default that has been waived by the Lenders pursuant 
to Section 9.08.
 
102

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(d)    Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears (i) on 
each Interest Payment Date for such Loan, (ii) in the case of Revolving 
Facility Loans under any Revolving Facility, upon termination of the 
Revolving Facility Commitments with respect to such Revolving Facility and 
(iii) in the case of the Term Loans, on the applicable Term Facility 
Maturity Date; provided, that (i) interest accrued pursuant to paragraph 
(c) of this Section shall be payable on demand, and (ii) in the event of 
any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than a prepayment of an ABR 
Loan (including any Swingline Loan) prior to the end of the Availability 
Period), accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall 
be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment.

(e)    All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 
360 days, except that interest computed by reference to the ABR at times 
when the ABR is based on the prime rate shall be computed on the basis of a 
year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and in each case shall be 
payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but 
excluding the last day). The applicable ABR, Adjusted Eurocurrency Rate or 
Eurocurrency Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such 
determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

SECTION 2.14.    Alternate Rate of Interest. If prior to the commencement 
of any Interest Period for a Eurocurrency Borrowing:

(a)    the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be 
conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not 
exist for ascertaining the Adjusted Eurocurrency Rate, as applicable, for 
such Interest Period; or

(b)    the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders or the 
Majority Lenders under all of the Revolving FacilityFacilities that the 
Adjusted Eurocurrency Rate for such Interest Period will not adequately and 
fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining their 
Loans included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;

then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrowers 
and the Lenders by telephone or electronic means as promptly as practicable 
thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrowers and 
the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer 
exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of 
any Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing as, a Eurocurrency 
Borrowing denominated in the applicable currency shall be ineffective and 
in the case of any Borrowing denominated in Dollars, such Borrowing shall 
be converted to or continued as on the last day of the Interest Period 
applicable thereto as an ABR Borrowing and (ii) if any Borrowing Request 
requests a Eurocurrency Borrowing in Dollars, such Borrowing shall be made 
as an ABR Borrowing.

SECTION 2.15.    Increased Costs.

(a)    If any Change in Law shall:

(i)    impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or 
similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, 
or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement 
reflected in the Adjusted Eurocurrency Rate) or L/C Issuer;
 
103

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(ii)    subject any Lender or L/C Issuer to any Tax with respect to any 
Loan Document or any Eurocurrency Loan made by it or any Letter of Credit 
or participation therein (other than Taxes indemnifiable under Section 2.17 
or Excluded Taxes); or

(iii)    impose on any Lender or the L/C Issuer or the London interbank 
market any other condition affecting this Agreement or Eurocurrency Loans 
made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to 
such Lender of making or maintaining any Eurocurrency Loan (or of 
maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost 
to such Lender or L/C Issuer of participating in, issuing or maintaining 
any Letter of Credit or to reduce the amount of any sum received or 
receivable by such Lender or L/C Issuer hereunder (whether of principal, 
interest or otherwise), then the Borrowers will pay to such Lender or L/C 
Issuer, as applicable, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate 
such Lender or L/C Issuer, as applicable, for such additional costs 
incurred or reduction suffered.

(b)    If any Lender or L/C Issuer determines that any Change in Law 
regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the 
rate of return on such Lenders or L/C Issuers capital or on the capital 
of such Lenders or L/C Issuers holding company, if any, as a consequence 
of this Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of 
Credit or Swingline Loans held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit 
issued by such L/C Issuer, to a level below that which such Lender or such 
L/C Issuer or such Lenders or such L/C Issuers holding company could have 
achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such 
Lenders or such L/C Issuers policies and the policies of such Lenders or 
such L/C Issuers holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then 
from time to time the Borrowers shall pay to such Lender or such L/C 
Issuer, as applicable, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate 
such Lender or such L/C Issuer or such Lenders or such L/C Issuers 
holding company for any such reduction suffered.

(c)    A certificate of a Lender or an L/C Issuer setting forth the amount 
or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or L/C Issuer or its holding 
company, as applicable, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this 
Section shall be delivered to the Borrowers and shall be conclusive absent 
manifest error. The Borrowers shall pay such Lender or L/C Issuer, as 
applicable, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days 
after receipt thereof.

(d)    Promptly after any Lender or any L/C Issuer has determined that it 
will make a request for increased compensation pursuant to this Section 
2.15, such Lender or L/C Issuer shall notify the Borrowers thereof. Failure 
or delay on the part of any Lender or L/C Issuer to demand compensation 
pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lenders or 
L/C Issuers right to demand such compensation; provided, that the 
Borrowers shall not be required to compensate a Lender or an L/C Issuer 
pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred 
more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender or L/C Issuer, as 
applicable, notifies the Borrowers of the Change in Law giving rise to such
 
104

------------------------------------------------------------------------
increased costs or reductions and of such Lenders or L/C Issuers 
intention to claim compensation therefor; provided, further, that, if the 
Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is 
retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to 
include the period of retroactive effect thereof.

SECTION 2.16.    Break Funding Payments . In the event of (a) the payment 
of any principal of any Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last day of an 
Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of 
Default), (b) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any 
Eurocurrency Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant 
hereto or (c) the assignment of any Eurocurrency Loan other than on the 
last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request 
by a Borrower pursuant to Section 2.19, then, in any such event, the 
Borrowers shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense 
attributable to such event. In the case of a Eurocurrency Loan, such loss, 
cost or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to be the amount determined 
by such Lender (it being understood that the deemed amount shall not exceed 
the actual amount) to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest 
which would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such 
event not occurred, at the Adjusted Eurocurrency Rate that would have been 
applicable to such Loan, for the period from the date of such event to the 
last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a 
failure to borrow, convert or continue a Eurocurrency Loan, for the period 
that would have been the Interest Period for such Loan), over (ii) the 
amount of interest which would accrue on such principal amount for such 
period at the interest rate which such Lender would bid were it to bid, at 
the commencement of such period, for deposits in dollars of a comparable 
amount and period from other banks in the Eurocurrency market. A 
certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such 
Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered 
to the Borrowers and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The 
Borrowers shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such 
certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.

SECTION 2.17.    Taxes.

(a)    Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Loan 
Party under any Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without 
withholding or deduction for any Taxes except as required by law; provided
, that if any applicable withholding agent shall be required to withhold or 
deduct any Taxes in respect of any such payments, then (i) if such Tax is 
an Indemnified Tax or Other Tax, the sum payable by the applicable Loan 
Party shall be increased as necessary so that after all required 
withholding or deductions have been made (including withholding or 
deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.17) 
the applicable Lender (or, in the case of a payment to the Administrative 
Agent for its own account, the Administrative Agent), receives an amount 
equal to the sum it would have received had no such withholding or 
deductions been made, (ii) the applicable withholding agent shall make such 
withholding or deductions and (iii) the applicable withholding agent shall 
timely pay the full amount withheld or deducted to the relevant 
Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

(b)    In addition, the Loan Parties shall pay any Other Taxes to the 
relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
 
105

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(c)    Each Loan Party shall jointly and severally indemnify the 
Administrative Agent and each Lender, within 10 days after written demand 
therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes 
payable by the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as applicable 
(including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or 
attributable to amounts payable under this Section 2.17), and any 
reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or 
not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed 
or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the 
amount of such payment or liability delivered to such Loan Party by a 
Lender, or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf, on behalf of 
another Agent or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest 
error.

(d)    As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or 
Other Taxes by a Loan Party to a Governmental Authority, such Loan Party 
shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy 
of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, 
a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such 
payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

(e)    Each Foreign Lender shall deliver to the Borrowers and the 
Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender 
becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter 
upon the reasonable request of the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent), 
two original copies of whichever of the following is applicable: (i) duly 
completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN (or any subsequent 
versions thereof or successors thereto), claiming eligibility for benefits 
of an income tax treaty to which the United States of America is a party, 
(ii) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI (or any 
subsequent versions thereof or successors thereto), (iii) in the case of a 
Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio 
interest under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate in a 
form reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent (a Non-Bank 
Certificate), and (y) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service 
Form W-8BEN (or any subsequent versions thereof or successors thereto), 
(iv) to the extent the Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner (e.g., 
where the Foreign Lender is a partnership or participating Lender), duly 
completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8IMY, together with 
appropriate forms and certificates described in Sections 2.17(e)(i) through 
(iii) and any additional Form W-8IMYs, withholding statements and other 
information as may be required by law (provided that, where a Foreign 
Lender is a partnership (and not a participating Lender) and one or more of 
its direct or indirect partners are claiming the portfolio interest 
exemption, the Foreign Lender may provide the Non-Bank Certificate on 
behalf of such direct or indirect partners) or (v) any other form 
prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a 
reduction in United States federal withholding tax duly completed together 
with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable 
law to permit the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent to determine the 
withholding or deduction required to be made.

(f)    Each U.S. Lender shall deliver to the Borrowers and the 
Administrative Agent two duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service 
Form W-9 (or any subsequent versions thereof or successors thereto) 
certifying that such U.S. Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup 
withholding on or before the date such U.S. Lender becomes a party and upon 
the expiration of any form previously delivered by such U.S. Lender.
 
106

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(g)    If a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be 
subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender 
were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA 
(including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as 
applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrowers and the 
Administrative Agent, at the time or times prescribed by law and at such 
time or times reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Administrative 
Agent, such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as 
prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional 
documentation reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Administrative 
Agent as may be necessary for the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent to 
comply with their obligations under FATCA, to determine whether such Lender 
has complied with such Lenders obligations under FATCA and to determine 
the amount, if any, to deduct and withhold from such payment.

(h)    Notwithstanding any other provision of Section 2.17(e), (f) or (g), 
a Lender shall not be required to deliver any form that such Lender is not 
legally eligible to deliver.

(i)    Each Lender shall, whenever a lapse in time or change in 
circumstances renders any documentation previously provided pursuant to 
Sections 2.17(e), (f) or (g) obsolete, expired or inaccurate in any 
respect, deliver promptly to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent 
updated or other appropriate documentation (including any new documentation 
reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent) or 
promptly notify the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent in writing of 
its legal ineligibility to do so.

(j)    If any Borrower determines that a reasonable basis exists for 
contesting an Indemnified Tax or Other Tax for which a Loan Party has paid 
additional amounts or indemnification payments, each affected Lender or the 
Administrative Agent, as the case may be, shall use reasonable efforts to 
cooperate with such Borrower as such Borrower may reasonably request in 
contesting such Tax; provided that nothing in this Section 2.17(j) shall 
obligate any Lender or the Administrative Agent to take any action that 
such person, in its sole judgment, determines may result in a material 
detriment to such person. The Borrowers shall indemnify and hold each 
Lender and the Administrative Agent harmless against any out-of-pocket 
expenses incurred by such person in connection with any request made by the 
Borrowers pursuant to this Section 2.17(j). Any refund received from a 
successful contest shall be governed by Section 2.17(k).

(k)    If the Administrative Agent or a Lender has received a refund of any 
Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by a 
Loan Party or with respect to which such Loan Party has paid additional 
amounts pursuant to this Section 2.17, it shall pay over such refund to 
such Loan Party (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or 
additional amounts paid, by such Loan Party under this Section 2.17 with 
respect to the Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such 
refund), net of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative 
Agent or such Lender (including any Taxes imposed with respect to such 
refund) as is determined by the Administrative Agent or Lender in good 
faith, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant 
Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); provided, that such 
Loan Party, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, 
agrees to repay as soon as reasonably practicable the amount paid over to
 
107

------------------------------------------------------------------------
such Loan Party (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by 
the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such 
Lender in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to 
repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. In such event, such 
Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, shall, at the 
applicable Loan Partys request, provide such Loan Party with a copy of any 
notice of assessment or other evidence of the requirement to repay such 
refund received from the relevant Governmental Authority (provided that 
such Lender or the Administrative Agent may delete any information therein 
that it deems confidential). A Lender or the Administrative Agent shall 
claim any refund that it determines is available to it, unless it concludes 
in its sole discretion that it would be adversely affected by making such a 
claim. This Section 2.17(k) shall not be construed to require the 
Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its Tax returns (or 
any other information relating to its Taxes which it deems in good faith to 
be confidential) to the Loan Parties or any other person. Notwithstanding 
anything to the contrary, in no event will any Lender be required to pay 
any amount to a Loan Party the payment of which would place such Lender in 
a less favorable net after tax position than such Lender would have been in 
if the additional amounts giving rise to such refund of any Indemnified 
Taxes or Other Taxes had never been paid.

(l)    If any Administrative Agent is a United States person (as defined 
in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code), it shall provide the Borrowers, on or 
before the date on which it becomes a party to this Agreement, with two 
duly completed original copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 (or any 
successor form) certifying that such Administrative Agent is exempt from 
U.S. federal backup withholding. If any Administrative Agent is not a 
United States person (as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code), on 
or before the date on which it becomes a party to this Agreement, it shall 
provide (1) Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI (or any successor form) 
with respect to payments to be received by it as a beneficial owner and (2) 
Internal Revenue Service Form W-8IMY (or any successor form), together with 
required accompanying documentation, with respect to payments to be 
received by it on behalf of the Lenders. Each Administrative Agent shall, 
whenever a lapse in time or change in circumstances renders any 
documentation previously provided pursuant to Sections 2.17(l) obsolete, 
expired or inaccurate in any respect, deliver promptly to the Borrowers 
updated or other appropriate documentation (including any new documentation 
reasonably requested by the Borrowers) or promptly notify the Borrowers in 
writing of its legal ineligibility to do so. Notwithstanding anything to 
the contrary, nothing in this Section 2.17(l) shall require any 
Administrative Agent to provide any documentation that it is not legally 
eligible to provide as a result of any Change of Law after the date hereof.

(m)    For the avoidance of doubt, the term Lender shall, for purposes of 
this Section 2.17, include any L/C Issuer and any Swingline Lender.

SECTION 2.18.    Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of 
Set-offs.

(a)    The Borrowers shall make each payment required to be made by it 
hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees or reimbursement of 
drawings under Letters of Credit, or of amounts payable under Section 2.15, 
2.16, or 2.17, or otherwise) without condition or deduction for any 
defense, recoupment, set-off or counterclaim. Except as otherwise expressly 
provided herein, all payments by the Borrowers hereunder shall be made to 
the
 
108

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which 
such payment is owed, at the applicable Administrative Agents Office in 
Dollars and in Same Day Funds not later than 2:00 p.m., Local Time, on the 
date specified herein. Any amounts received after such time on any date 
may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been 
received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating 
interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative 
Agent to the applicable account designated to the applicable Borrower by 
the Administrative Agent, except payments to be made directly to the 
applicable L/C Issuer or the Swingline Lender as expressly provided herein 
and except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.05 
shall be made directly to the persons entitled thereto. Without limiting 
the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent may require that 
any payments due under this Agreement be made in the United States. The 
Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for 
the account of any other person to the appropriate recipient promptly 
following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day 
that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the 
next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing 
interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such 
extension. Any payment required to be made by the Administrative Agent 
hereunder shall be deemed to have been made by the time required if the 
Administrative Agent shall, at or before such time, have taken the 
necessary steps to make such payment in accordance with the regulations or 
operating procedures of the clearing or settlement system used by the 
Administrative Agent to make such payment.

(b)    If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to 
the Administrative Agent from the Borrowers to pay fully all amounts of 
principal, Unreimbursed Amounts, interest and fees then due from the 
Borrowers hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment 
of interest and fees then due from the Borrowers hereunder, ratably among 
the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and 
fees then due to such parties and (ii) second, towards payment of principal 
of Loans and Unreimbursed Amounts then due from the Borrowers hereunder, 
ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts 
of principal and Unreimbursed Amounts then due to such parties.

(c)    If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or 
counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or 
interest on any of its Term Loans, Revolving Facility Loans or 
participations in Letters of Credit or Swingline Loans resulting in such 
Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of 
its Term Loans, Revolving Facility Loans and participations in Letters of 
Credit and Swingline Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion 
received by any other Lender entitled thereto, then the Lender receiving 
such greater proportion shall purchase participations in the Term Loans, 
Revolving Facility Loans and participations in Letters of Credit and 
Swingline Loans of other Lenders entitled thereto to the extent necessary 
so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders 
entitled thereto ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of 
principal of and accrued interest on their respective Term Loans, Revolving 
Facility Loans and participations in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans; 
provided, that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any 
portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such 
participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the 
extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this 
paragraph (c) shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the 
Borrowers pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this 
Agreement (including, without limitation, pursuant to Section 2.11(g)
 
109

------------------------------------------------------------------------
and Section 9.04(i)) or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration 
for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or 
participations in Letters of Credit to any assignee or participant, other 
than to a Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof (as to which the provisions of 
this paragraph (c) shall apply). Each Borrower consents to the foregoing 
and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, 
that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing 
arrangements may exercise against such Borrower rights of set-off and 
counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender 
were a direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such 
participation.

(d)    Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from any 
Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the 
Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the applicable L/C 
Issuer hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment, the 
Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower have made such payment 
on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such 
assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the applicable L/C Issuer, as 
applicable, the amount due. In such event, if such Borrower has not in fact 
made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the applicable L/C Issuer, 
as applicable, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent 
forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or L/C Issuer 
with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount 
is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the 
Administrative Agent, at the Overnight Rate.

(e)    If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by 
it pursuant to Section 2.04(c), 2.05(d) or (e), 2.06(b) or 2.18(d), then 
the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any 
contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the 
Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such 
Lenders obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied 
obligations are fully paid.

SECTION 2.19.    Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.

(a)    If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if any 
Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any 
Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 
2.17, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a 
different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to 
assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, 
branches or Affiliates, if, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, such 
designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable 
pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.17, as applicable, in the future and (ii) 
would not subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense 
and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender in any material 
respect. The Borrowers hereby agree to pay all reasonable costs and 
expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or 
assignment.

(b)    If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if any 
Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any 
Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 
2.17, or if any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, or if any Lender is the 
subject of a Disqualification, then any Borrower may, at its sole expense 
and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, 
require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance 
with and subject to the restrictions
 
110

------------------------------------------------------------------------
contained in Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under 
this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which 
assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); 
provided, that (i) the Borrowers shall have received the prior written 
consent of the Administrative Agent (and, if in respect of any Revolving 
Facility Commitment or Revolving Facility Loan, the Swingline Lender and 
the L/C Issuer), which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) 
such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the 
outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in L/C Obligations 
and Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other 
amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such 
outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrowers (in 
the case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment 
resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.15 or payments 
required to be made pursuant to Section 2.17, such assignment will result 
in a reduction in such compensation or payments. Nothing in this Section 
2.19 shall be deemed to prejudice any rights that the Borrowers may have 
against any Lender that is a Defaulting Lender. No action by or consent of 
the removed Lender shall be necessary in connection with such assignment, 
which shall be immediately and automatically effective upon payment of such 
purchase price. In connection with any such assignment the Borrowers, 
Administrative Agent, such removed Lender and the replacement Lender shall 
otherwise comply with Section 9.04; provided, that if such removed Lender 
does not comply with Section 9.04 within one Business Day after the 
applicable Borrowers request, compliance with Section 9.04 shall not be 
required to effect such assignment.

(c)    If any Lender (such Lender, a Non-Consenting Lender) has failed to 
consent to a proposed amendment, waiver, discharge or termination which 
pursuant to the terms of Section 9.08 requires the consent of all of the 
Lenders affected and with respect to which the Required Lenders shall have 
granted their consent, then the Borrowers shall have the right (unless such 
Non-Consenting Lender grants such consent) at its sole expense (including 
with respect to the processing and recordation fee referred to in Section 
9.04(b)(ii)(B)) to replace such Non-Consenting Lender by deeming such 
Non-Consenting Lender to have assigned its Loans, and its Commitments 
hereunder to one or more assignees reasonably acceptable to (i) the 
Administrative Agent (unless, in the case of an assignment of Term Loans, 
such assignee is a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund) 
and (ii) if in respect of any Revolving Facility Commitment or Revolving 
Facility Loan, the Swingline Lender and the L/C Issuer); provided, that: 
(a) all Obligations of the Borrowers owing to such Non-Consenting Lender 
being replaced shall be paid in full to such Non-Consenting Lender 
concurrently with such assignment (including any amount payable pursuant to 
Section 2.11(a)) and (b) the replacement Lender shall purchase the 
foregoing by paying to such Non-Consenting Lender a price equal to the 
principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon. No 
action by or consent of the Non-Consenting Lender shall be necessary in 
connection with such assignment, which shall be immediately and 
automatically effective upon payment of such purchase price. In connection 
with any such assignment the Borrowers, Administrative Agent, such 
Non-Consenting Lender and the replacement Lender shall otherwise comply 
with Section 9.04; provided, that if such Non-Consenting Lender does not 
comply with Section 9.04 within one Business Day after the applicable 
Borrowers request, compliance with Section 9.04 shall not be required to 
effect such assignment.

SECTION 2.20.    Illegality. If any Lender reasonably determines that any 
Change in Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has 
asserted after the
 
111

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Closing Date that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable lending 
office to make or maintain any Eurocurrency Loans in any currency, then, on 
notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrowers through the Administrative 
Agent, any obligations of such Lender to make or continue Eurocurrency 
Loans in such currency or to convert ABR Borrowings to Eurocurrency 
Borrowings shall be suspended until such Lender notifies the Administrative 
Agent and the Borrowers that the circumstances giving rise to such 
determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrowers 
shall upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative 
Agent) to either (i) in the case of Loans denominated in Dollars if the 
affected Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Loans as 
Eurocurrency Loans until the last day of such Interest Period, convert all 
Eurocurrency Loans of such Lender to ABR Loans on the last day of such 
Interest Period (or, otherwise, immediately convert such Eurocurrency Loans 
to ABR Loans) or (ii) prepay such Eurocurrency Loans. Upon any such 
prepayment or conversion, the Borrowers shall also pay accrued interest on 
the amount so prepaid or converted.

SECTION 2.21.    Incremental Commitments.

(a)    Any Borrower may, by written notice to the Administrative Agent from 
time to time, request Incremental Term Loan Commitments and/or Incremental 
Revolving Facility Commitments, as applicable, in an amount not to exceed 
the Incremental Amount at the time such Incremental Commitments are 
established from one or more Incremental Term Lenders and/or Incremental 
Revolving Facility Lenders (which may include any existing Lender) willing 
to provide such Incremental Term Loans and/or Incremental Revolving 
Facility Commitments, as the case may be, in their own discretion. Such 
notice shall set forth (i) the amount of the Incremental Term Loan 
Commitments and/or Incremental Revolving Facility Commitments being 
requested (which shall be in minimum increments of $5.0 million and a 
minimum amount of $20.0 million or equal to the remaining Incremental 
Amount or in each case such lesser amount approved by the Administrative 
Agent), (ii) the date on which such Incremental Term Loan Commitments 
and/or Incremental Revolving Facility Commitments are requested to become 
effective (the Increased Amount Date), (iii) in the case of Incremental 
Term Loan Commitments, whether such Incremental Term Loan Commitments are 
to be commitments to make term loans with terms identical to Term B Loans 
or commitments to make term loans with pricing terms and/or amortization 
and/or participation in mandatory prepayments or commitment reductions 
and/or maturity and/or other terms different from the Term B Loans (Other 
Term Loans) and (iv) in the case of Incremental Revolving Facility 
Commitments, whether such Incremental Revolving Facility Commitments are to 
be commitments to make additional Revolving Facility Loans on the same 
terms as the Initial Revolving Loans or the same terms as the First 
Amendment Revolving Loans or commitments to make revolving loans with 
pricing terms and/or participation in mandatory prepayments or commitment 
reductions and/or maturity and/or other terms different from the Initial 
Revolving Loans and the First Amendment Revolving Loans (Other Revolving 
Loans).

(b)    The Borrowers and each Incremental Term Lender and/or Incremental 
Revolving Facility Lender shall execute and deliver to the Administrative 
Agent an Incremental Assumption Agreement and such other documentation as 
the Administrative Agent shall reasonably specify to evidence the 
Incremental Term Loan Commitment of such Incremental Term Lender and/or 
Incremental Revolving Facility Commitment of such Incremental Revolving 
Facility Lender. Each Incremental Assumption Agreement shall specify the 
terms of the applicable Incremental Term Loans and/or Incremental Revolving 
Facility Commitments; provided, that
 
112

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(i)    except as to pricing, amortization, final maturity date, 
participation in mandatory prepayments and ranking as to security (which 
shall, subject to clause (ii) through (iv) of this proviso, be determined 
by the Company and the Incremental Term Lenders in their sole discretion), 
the Other Term Loans shall have (x) the same terms as the Term B Loans, as 
applicable, or (y) such other terms as shall be reasonably satisfactory to 
the Administrative Agent,

(ii)    the Other Term Loans shall rank pari passu or, at the option of the 
Borrowers, junior in right of security with the Term B Loans (provided, 
that if such Other Term Loans rank junior in right of security with the 
Term B Loans, such Other Term Loans shall be subject to a Permitted Junior 
Intercreditor Agreement and, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not be 
subject to clause (viii) below),

(iii)    the final maturity date of any Other Term Loans shall be no 
earlier than the latest Term B Facility Maturity Date in effect on the date 
of incurrence,

(iv)    the weighted average life to maturity of any Other Term Loans shall 
be no shorter than the remaining weighted average life to maturity of the 
Term B Loans,

(v)    except as to pricing, amortization, final maturity date, 
participation in mandatory prepayments and ranking as to security (which 
shall, subject to clause (v) through (vii) of this proviso, be determined 
by the Company and the Incremental Revolving Facility Lenders in their sole 
discretion), the Other Revolving Loans shall have (x) substantially the 
same terms as the Initial Revolving Loans and the First Amendment Revolving 
Loans or (y) such other terms as shall be reasonably satisfactory to the 
Administrative Agent,

(vi)    the Other Revolving Loans shall rank pari passu or, at the option 
of the Borrowers, junior in right of security with the Initial Revolving 
Loans and the First Amendment Revolving Loans (provided, that if such Other 
Revolving Loans rank junior in right of security with the Initial Revolving 
Loans and First Amendment Revolving Loans and, for the avoidance of doubt, 
shall not be subject to clause (ix) below),

(vii)    the final maturity date of any Other Revolving Loans shall be no 
earlier than the Revolving Facility Maturity Date with respect to the 
Initial Revolving Loans and the First Amendment Revolving Loans,

(viii)    with respect to any Other Term Loan that ranks pari passu in 
right of security with the Term B Loans, the All-in Yield shall be the same 
as that applicable to the Term B Loans on the Closing Date, except that the 
All-in Yield in respect of any such Other Term Loan may exceed the All-in 
Yield in respect of such Term B Loans on the Closing Date by no more than 
0.50%, or if it does so exceed such All-in Yield (such difference, the 
Term Yield Differential) then the Applicable Margin (or the LIBOR floor 
as provided in the following proviso) applicable to such Term B Loans shall 
be
 
113

------------------------------------------------------------------------
increased such that after giving effect to such increase, the Term Yield 
Differential shall not exceed 0.50%; provided that, to the extent any 
portion of the Term Yield Differential is attributable to a higher LIBOR 
floor being applicable to such Other Term Loans, such floor shall only be 
included in the calculation of the Term Yield Differential to the extent 
such floor is greater than the Adjusted Eurocurrency Rate in effect for an 
Interest Period of three months duration at such time, and, with respect 
to such excess, the LIBOR floor applicable to the outstanding Term B 
Loans shall be increased to an amount not to exceed the LIBOR floor 
applicable to such Other Term Loans prior to any increase in the Applicable 
Margin applicable to such Term B Loans then outstanding, and

(ix)    with respect to any commitments to make Other Revolving Loans that 
rank pari passu in right of security with the Initial Revolving Loans, the 
All-in Yield of such Other Revolving Loans shall be the same as that 
applicable to the Initial Revolving Loans on the Closing Date, except that 
the All-in Yield in respect of any such Other Revolving Loan may exceed the 
All-in Yield in respect of such Initial Revolving Loans on the Closing Date 
by no more than 0.50%, or if it does so exceed such All-in Yield (such 
difference, the Revolving Yield Differential) then the Applicable Margin 
applicable to such Initial Revolving Loans shall be increased such that 
after giving effect to such increase, the Revolving Yield Differential 
shall not exceed 0.50%.

Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that, upon the effectiveness of 
any Incremental Assumption Agreement, this Agreement shall be amended to 
the extent (but only to the extent) necessary to reflect the existence and 
terms of the Incremental Term Loan Commitments and/or Incremental Revolving 
Facility Commitments evidenced thereby as provided for in Section 9.08(e). 
Any amendment to this Agreement or any other Loan Document that is 
necessary to effect the provisions of this Section 2.21 and any such 
collateral and other documentation shall be deemed Loan Documents 
hereunder and such deemed amendment may be memorialized in writing by the 
Administrative Agent with the Borrowers consent (not to be unreasonably 
withheld) and furnished to the other parties hereto.

(c)    Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Incremental Term Loan Commitment 
or Incremental Revolving Facility Commitment shall become effective under 
this Section 2.21 unless on the date of such effectiveness, no Default or 
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing or would result 
therefrom.

(d)    Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that the Administrative 
Agent may take any and all action as may be reasonably necessary to ensure 
that (i) all Incremental Term Loans (other than Other Term Loans), when 
originally made, are included in each Borrowing of the outstanding 
applicable Class of Term Loans on a pro rata basis, and (ii) all Revolving 
Facility Loans in respect of Incremental Revolving Facility Commitments 
(other than Other Revolving Loans), when originally made, are included in 
each Borrowing of the applicable Class of outstanding Revolving Facility 
Loans on a pro rata basis. The Borrowers agree that Section 2.16 shall 
apply to any conversion of Eurocurrency Loans to ABR Loans reasonably 
required by the Administrative Agent to effect the foregoing.
 
114

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(e)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, 
including Section 2.11(a) or Section 2.18(c) (which provisions shall not be 
applicable to clauses (e) through (i) of this Section 2.21), pursuant to 
one or more offers made from time to time by a Borrower to all Lenders of 
any Class of Term Loans and/or Revolving Facility Commitments, on a pro 
rata basis (based, in the case of an offer to the Lenders under any Class 
of Term Loans, on the aggregate outstanding Term Loans of such Class and, 
in the case of an offer to the Lenders under any Revolving Facility, on the 
aggregate outstanding Revolving Facility Commitments under such Revolving 
Facility, as applicable) and on the same terms (Pro Rata Extension Offers
), the Borrowers are hereby permitted to consummate transactions with 
individual Lenders from time to time to extend the maturity date of such 
Lenders Loans and/or Commitments of such Class and to otherwise modify the 
terms of such Lenders Loans and/or Commitments of such Class pursuant to 
the terms of the relevant Pro Rata Extension Offer (including without 
limitation increasing the interest rate or fees payable in respect of such 
Lenders Loans and/or Commitments and/or modifying the amortization 
schedule in respect of such Lenders Loans). For the avoidance of doubt, 
the reference to on the same terms in the preceding sentence shall mean, 
in the case of an offer to the Lenders under any Class of Term Loans, that 
all of the Term Loans of such Class and, in the case of an offer to the 
Lenders under any Revolving Facility, that all of the Revolving Facility 
Commitments in respect of such Revolving Facility are, in each case, 
offered to be extended for the same amount of time and that the interest 
rate changes and fees payable with respect to such extension are the same. 
Any such extension (an Extension) agreed to between the applicable 
Borrower and any such Lender (an Extending Lender) will be established 
under this Agreement by implementing an Incremental Term Loan for such 
Lender (if such Lender is extending an existing Term Loan (such extended 
Term Loan, an Extended Term Loan)) or an Incremental Revolving Facility 
Commitment for such Lender (if such Lender is extending an existing 
Revolving Facility Commitment (such extended Revolving Facility Commitment, 
an Extended Revolving Facility Commitment)).

(f)    The applicable Borrower and each Extending Lender shall execute and 
deliver to the Administrative Agent an Incremental Assumption Agreement and 
such other documentation as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably 
specify to evidence the Extended Term Loans and/or Extended Revolving 
Facility Commitments of such Extending Lender. Each Incremental Assumption 
Agreement shall specify the terms of the applicable Extended Term Loans 
and/or Extended Revolving Facility Commitments; provided that (i) except as 
to interest rates, fees, any other pricing terms, amortization, final 
maturity date and participation in prepayments and commitment reductions 
(which shall, subject to clauses (ii) and (iii) of this proviso, be 
determined by the applicable Borrower and set forth in the Pro Rata 
Extension Offer), the Extended Term Loans shall have (x) the same terms as 
the existing Class of Term Loans or (y) such other terms as shall be 
reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, (ii) the final 
maturity date of any Extended Term Loans shall be no earlier than the 
latest Term Facility Maturity Date in effect on the date of incurrence, 
(iii) the weighted average life to maturity of any Extended Term Loans 
shall be no shorter than the remaining weighted average life to maturity of 
the Class of Term Loans to which such offer relates, (iv) except as to 
interest rates, fees, any other pricing terms, participation in mandatory 
prepayments and commitment reductions and final maturity (which shall be 
determined by the applicable Borrower and set forth in the Pro Rata 
Extension Offer), any Extended Revolving Facility Commitment shall have (x) 
the same terms as an existing Class of Revolving Facility Commitments or 
(y) have such other terms as shall be reasonably satisfactory to the 
Administrative Agent, and (v) any Extended
 
115

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Term Loans and/or Extended Revolving Facility Commitments may participate 
on a pro rata basis or a less than pro rata basis (but not greater than a 
pro rata basis) in any voluntary or mandatory repayments or prepayments 
hereunder. Upon the effectiveness of any Incremental Assumption Agreement, 
this Agreement shall be amended to the extent (but only to the extent) 
necessary to reflect the existence and terms of the Extended Term Loans 
and/or Extended Revolving Facility Commitments evidenced thereby as 
provided for in Section 9.08(e). Any such deemed amendment may be 
memorialized in writing by the Administrative Agent with the Borrowers 
consent (not to be unreasonably withheld) and furnished to the other 
parties hereto. If provided in any Incremental Assumption Agreement with 
respect to any Extended Revolving Facility Commitments, and with the 
consent of each Swingline Lender and L/C Issuer, participations in 
Swingline Loans and Letters of Credit shall be reallocated to lenders 
holding such Extended Revolving Facility Commitments in the manner 
specified in such Incremental Assumption Agreement, including upon 
effectiveness of such Extended Revolving Facility Commitment or upon or 
prior to the maturity date for any Class of Revolving Facility Commitments.

(g)    Upon the effectiveness of any such Extension, the applicable 
Extending Lenders Term Loan will be automatically designated an Extended 
Term Loan and/or such Extending Lenders Revolving Facility Commitment will 
be automatically designated an Extended Revolving Facility Commitment. For 
purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, (i) if such 
Extending Lender is extending a Term Loan, such Extending Lender will be 
deemed to have an Incremental Term Loan having the terms of such Extended 
Term Loan and (ii) if such Extending Lender is extending a Revolving 
Facility Commitment, such Extending Lender will be deemed to have an 
Incremental Revolving Facility Commitment having the terms of such Extended 
Revolving Facility Commitment.

(h)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement 
or any other Loan Document (including without limitation this Section 
2.21), (i) the aggregate amount of Extended Term Loans and Extended 
Revolving Facility Commitments will not be included in the calculation of 
the Incremental Amount, (ii) no Extended Term Loan or Extended Revolving 
Facility Commitment is required to be in any minimum amount or any minimum 
increment, (iii) any Extending Lender may extend all or any portion of its 
Term Loans and/or Revolving Facility Commitment pursuant to one or more Pro 
Rata Extension Offers (subject to applicable proration in the case of over 
participation) (including the extension of any Extended Term Loan and/or 
Extended Revolving Facility Commitment), (iv) there shall be no condition 
to any Extension of any Loan or Commitment at any time or from time to time 
other than notice to the Administrative Agent of such Extension and the 
terms of the Extended Term Loan or Extended Revolving Facility Commitment 
implemented thereby and (v) all Extended Term Loans, Extended Revolving 
Facility Commitments and all obligations in respect thereof shall be Loan 
Obligations of the relevant Loan Parties under this Agreement and the other 
Loan Documents that are secured by the Collateral on a pari passu basis 
with all other Obligations of the relevant Loan Parties under this 
Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

(i)    Each Extension shall be consummated pursuant to procedures set forth 
in the associated Pro Rata Extension Offer; provided that the Borrowers 
shall cooperate with the Administrative Agent prior to making any Pro Rata 
Extension Offer to establish reasonable procedures with respect to 
mechanical provisions relating to such Extension, including, without 
limitation, timing, rounding and other adjustments.
 
 
116

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(j)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, 
including Section 2.11(a) or Section 2.18(c) (which provisions shall not be 
applicable to clause (j) through (o) of this Section 2.21), any Borrower 
may by written notice to the Administrative Agent establish one or more 
additional tranches of term loans under this Agreement (such loans, 
Refinancing Term Loans), the net cash proceeds of which are used to 
Refinance in whole or in part any Class of Term Loans. Each such notice 
shall specify the date (each, a Refinancing Effective Date) on which the 
applicable Borrower proposes that the Refinancing Term Loans shall be made, 
which shall be a date not less than five Business Days after the date on 
which such notice is delivered to the Administrative Agent (or such shorter 
period agreed to by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion); 
provided that: (i) before and after giving effect to the borrowing of such 
Refinancing Term Loans on the Refinancing Effective Date each of the 
conditions set forth in Section 4.01 shall be satisfied to the extent 
required by the relevant Incremental Assumption Agreement governing such 
Refinancing Term Loans (except that no Default or Event of Default pursuant 
to Section 7.01(b), (c), (h) or (i) shall have occurred and be continuing); 
(ii) the weighted average life to maturity of such Refinancing Term Loans 
shall be no shorter than the then remaining weighted average life to 
maturity of the refinanced Term Loans; and (iii) all other terms applicable 
to such Refinancing Term Loans (other than provisions relating to original 
issue discount, upfront fees, interest rates or any other pricing terms and 
optional prepayment or mandatory prepayment or redemption terms and final 
maturity which shall be as agreed between the applicable Borrower and the 
Lenders providing such Refinancing Term Loans) taken as a whole shall be 
substantially similar to, or not materially more favorable to the Lenders 
providing such Refinancing Term Loans than, the terms, taken as a whole, 
applicable to the Term B Loans (except to the extent such covenants and 
other terms apply solely to any period after the latest final maturity of 
the Term Loans in effect on the date of incurrence of such Refinancing Term 
Loans), as determined by the Borrowers in good faith. In addition, 
notwithstanding the foregoing, any Borrower may establish Refinancing Term 
Loans to refinance and/or replace all or any portion of a Revolving 
Facility Commitment (regardless of whether Revolving Facility Loans are 
outstanding under such Revolving Facility Commitments at the time of 
incurrence of such Refinancing Term Loans), so long as (i) the aggregate 
amount of such Refinancing Term Loans does not exceed the aggregate amount 
of Revolving Facility Commitments terminated at the time of incurrence 
thereof and (ii) if the Revolving Facility Credit Exposure outstanding on 
the Refinancing Effective Date would exceed the aggregate amount of 
Revolving Facility Commitments outstanding in each case after giving effect 
to the termination of such Revolving Facility Commitments, the applicable 
Borrower shall take one or more of the actions contemplated by Section 
2.11(d) such that such Revolving Facility Credit Exposure does not exceed 
such aggregate amount of Revolving Facility Commitments in effect on the 
Refinancing Effective Date after giving effect to the termination of such 
Revolving Facility Commitments (it being understood that such Refinancing 
Term Loans may be provided by the Lenders holding the Revolving Facility 
Commitments being terminated and/or by any other Person that would be a 
permitted Assignee hereunder).

(k)    Any Borrower may approach any Lender or any other Person that would 
be a permitted Assignee pursuant to Section 9.04 to provide all or a 
portion of the Refinancing Term Loans; provided that any Lender offered or 
approached to provide all or a portion of the
 
117

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Refinancing Term Loans may elect or decline, in its sole discretion, to 
provide a Refinancing Term Loan. Any Refinancing Term Loans made on any 
Refinancing Effective Date shall be designated an additional Class of Term 
Loans for all purposes of this Agreement; provided that any Refinancing 
Term Loans may, to the extent provided in the applicable Incremental 
Assumption Agreement, be designated as an increase in any previously 
established Class of Term Loans made to such Borrower.

(l)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, 
including Section 2.11(a) and Section 2.18(c) (which provisions shall not 
be applicable to clauses (l) through (o) of this Section 2.21), any 
Borrower may by written notice to the Administrative Agent establish one or 
more additional Facilities providing for revolving commitments (
Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments and the revolving loans 
thereunder, Replacement Revolving Loans), which replaces in whole or in 
part any Class of Revolving Facility Commitments under this Agreement. Each 
such notice shall specify the date (each, a Replacement Revolving Facility 
Effective Date) on which such Borrower proposes that the Replacement 
Revolving Facility Commitments shall become effective, which shall be a 
date not less than five Business Days after the date on which such notice 
is delivered to the Administrative Agent (or such shorter period agreed to 
by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion); provided that: 
(i) before and after giving effect to the establishment of such Replacement 
Revolving Facility Commitments on the Replacement Revolving Facility 
Effective Date each of the conditions set forth in Section 4.01 shall be 
satisfied to the extent required by the relevant Incremental Assumption 
Agreement governing such Refinancing Term Loans (except that no Default or 
Event of Default pursuant to Section 7.01(b), (c), (h) or (i) shall have 
occurred and be continuing); (ii) after giving effect to the establishment 
of any Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments and any concurrent 
reduction in the aggregate amount of any other Revolving Facility 
Commitments, the aggregate amount of Revolving Facility Commitments shall 
not exceed the aggregate amount of the Revolving Facility Commitments 
outstanding immediately prior to the applicable Replacement Revolving 
Facility Effective Date; (iii) no Replacement Revolving Facility 
Commitments shall have a final maturity date prior to the latest Revolving 
Facility Maturity Date in effect at the time of incurrence; (iv) all other 
terms applicable to such Replacement Revolving Facility (other than 
provisions relating to (x) fees, interest rates and other pricing terms and 
prepayment and commitment reduction and optional redemption terms which 
shall be as agreed between the Borrowers and the Lenders providing such 
Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments and (y) the amount of any letter 
of credit sublimit and swingline commitment under such Replacement 
Revolving Facility which shall be as agreed between the applicable 
Borrower, the Lenders providing such Replacement Revolving Facility 
Commitments, the Administrative Agent and the Replacement L/C Issuer and 
Replacement Swingline Lender, if any, under such Replacement Revolving 
Facility Commitments) taken as a whole shall be substantially similar to, 
or not materially more favorable to the Lenders providing such Replacement 
Revolving Facility Commitments than, those, taken as a whole, applicable to 
the then outstanding Revolving Facility (except to the extent such 
covenants and other terms apply solely to any period after the latest final 
maturity of the Revolving Facility Commitments in effect on the date of 
incurrence of such Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments) as 
determined by the Borrowers in good faith. In addition, any Borrower may 
establish Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments to refinance and/or 
replace all or any portion of a Term Loan hereunder (regardless of whether 
such Term Loan is repaid with the proceeds of Replacement Revolving Loans 
or otherwise), so long as the
 
118

------------------------------------------------------------------------
aggregate amount of such Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments does 
not exceed the aggregate amount of Term Loans repaid at the time of 
establishment thereof (it being understood that such Replacement Revolving 
Facility Commitment may be provided by the Lenders holding the Term Loans 
being repaid and/or by any other Person that would be a permitted Assignee 
hereunder).

(m)    Any Borrower may approach any Lender or any other Person that would 
be a permitted Assignee of a Revolving Facility Commitment pursuant to 
Section 9.04 (such Person, a Replacement Revolving Lender) to provide all 
or a portion of the Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments; provided 
that any Lender offered or approached to provide all or a portion of the 
Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments may elect or decline, in its 
sole discretion, to provide a Replacement Revolving Facility Commitment. 
Any Replacement Revolving Facility Commitment made on any Replacement 
Revolving Facility Effective Date shall be designated an additional Class 
of Revolving Facility Commitments for all purposes of this Agreement; 
provided that any Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments may, to the 
extent provided in the applicable Incremental Assumption Agreement, be 
designated as an increase in any previously established Class of Revolving 
Facility Commitments.

(n)    On any Replacement Revolving Facility Effective Date, subject to the 
satisfaction of the foregoing terms and conditions, each of the Lenders 
with Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments of such Class shall 
purchase from each of the other Lenders with Replacement Revolving Facility 
Commitments of such Class, at the principal amount thereof and in the 
applicable currencies, such interests in the Replacement Revolving Loans 
and participations in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans under such 
Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments of such Class then outstanding 
on such Replacement Revolving Facility Effective Date as shall be necessary 
in order that, after giving effect to all such assignments and purchases, 
the Replacement Revolving Loans and participations of such Replacement 
Revolving Facility Commitments of such Class will be held by the Lenders 
thereunder ratably in accordance with their Replacement Revolving Credit 
Percentages.

(o)    For purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, (i) if 
a Lender is providing a Refinancing Term Loan, such Lender will be deemed 
to have an Incremental Term Loan having the terms of such Refinancing Term 
Loan and (ii) if a Lender is providing a Replacement Revolving Facility 
Commitment, such Lender will be deemed to have an Incremental Revolving 
Facility Commitment having the terms of such Replacement Revolving Facility 
Commitment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this 
Agreement or any other Loan Document (including without limitation this 
Section 2.21), (i) the aggregate amount of Refinancing Term Loans and 
Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments will not be included in the 
calculation of the Incremental Amount, (ii) no Refinancing Term Loan or 
Replacement Revolving Facility Commitment is required to be in any minimum 
amount or any minimum increment, (iii) there shall be no condition to any 
incurrence of any Refinancing Term Loan or Replacement Revolving Facility 
Commitment at any time or from time to time other than those set forth in 
clauses (j) or (l) above, as applicable, and (iv) all Refinancing Term 
Loans, Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments and all obligations in 
respect thereof shall be Obligations under this Agreement and the other 
Loan Documents that are secured by the Collateral on a pari passu basis 
with all other Obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan 
Documents.
 
119

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(p)    Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, (i) for 
the purpose of determining the number of outstanding Eurocurrency 
Borrowings upon the incurrence of any Incremental Loans, (x) to the extent 
the last date of Interest Periods for multiple Eurocurrency Borrowings 
under the Term Facilities fall on the same day, such Eurocurrency 
Borrowings shall be considered a single Eurocurrency Borrowing and (y) to 
the extent the last date of Interest Periods for multiple Eurocurrency 
Borrowings under the Revolving Facilities fall on the same day, such 
Eurocurrency Borrowings shall be considered a single Eurocurrency Borrowing 
and (ii) the initial Interest Period with respect to any Eurocurrency 
Borrowing of Incremental Loans may, at the applicable Borrowers option, be 
of a duration of a number of Business Days that is less than one month, and 
the Adjusted Eurocurrency Rate with respect to such initial Interest Period 
shall be the same as the Adjusted Eurocurrency Rate applicable to any 
then-outstanding Eurocurrency Borrowing as such Borrower may direct, so 
long as the last day of such initial Interest Period is the same as the 
last day of the Interest Period with respect to such outstanding 
Eurocurrency Borrowing.

SECTION 2.22.    Defaulting Lenders.

(i)    Adjustments. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in 
this Agreement, if any Lender under any Revolving Facility becomes a 
Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as that Lender is no longer a 
Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable laws, rules and 
regulations of any Governmental Authority, during any period in which there 
is a Defaulting Lender, for purposes of computing the amount of the 
obligation of each non-Defaulting Lender under any such Revolving Facility 
to acquire, refinance or fund participations in Letters of Credit or 
Swingline Loans pursuant to Sections 2.04 and 2.05, the Revolving Facility 
Percentage of each non-Defaulting Lender under such Revolving Facility 
shall be computed without giving effect to the Revolving Facility 
Commitment of that Defaulting Lender; provided, that, (i) each such 
reallocation shall be given effect only if, at the date the applicable 
Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, no Default or Event of Default exists; 
and (ii) the aggregate obligation of each non-Defaulting Lender to acquire, 
refinance or fund participations in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans 
under such Revolving Facility in connection with such reallocation shall 
not exceed the Available Unused Commitment of such Lender.

(ii)    Waivers and Amendments. Such Defaulting Lenders right to approve 
or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this 
Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in the definitions of Required 
Lenders or Majority Lenders.

(iii)    Cash Collateral. To the extent the reallocation pursuant to clause 
(i) above is insufficient for any reason to cover the L/C Issuers and 
Swingline Lenders Fronting Exposure to a Defaulting Lender, the applicable 
Borrower shall Cash Collateralize such uncovered Fronting Exposure pursuant 
to arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

(iv)    Limitation on Swingline Loans and Letters of Credit. 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, so long as any 
Lender is a Defaulting Lender, no Swingline Lender shall have any 
obligation to make Swingline Loans and no L/C Issuer shall have any 
obligation to issue, amend or renew any Letter of Credit at any time there 
is Fronting Exposure, in each case, unless the Swingline Lender or the L/C 
Issuer, respectively, is satisfied that it will have no Fronting Exposure 
after giving effect thereto.
 
120

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(v)    Reallocation of Payments. Any payment of principal, interest, fees 
or other amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the account of a 
Defaulting Lender on account of its Loans or participations under the 
applicable Class of Revolving Facility Commitments (whether voluntary or 
mandatory, at maturity, following an Event of Default or otherwise) or 
received by the Administrative Agent from a Defaulting Lender pursuant to 
Section 9.06, shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined 
by the Administrative Agent as follows: first, to the payment of any 
amounts owing by that Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent 
hereunder; second, to the payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts owing 
by that Defaulting Lender to the L/C Issuer or Swingline Lender hereunder; 
third, if so determined by the Administrative Agent or requested by the L/C 
Issuer or Swingline Lender, to be held as Cash Collateral for future 
funding obligations of that Defaulting Lender of any participation in any 
Swingline Loan or Letter of Credit; fourth, as the applicable Borrower may 
request (so long as no Default or Event of Default exists), to the funding 
of any Loan in respect of which that Defaulting Lender has failed to fund 
its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the 
Administrative Agent; fifth, if so determined by the Administrative Agent 
and the Borrowers, to be held in a non-interest bearing deposit account and 
released in order to satisfy obligations of that Defaulting Lender to fund 
Loans under this Agreement; sixth, to the payment of any amounts owing to 
the Lenders, the L/C Issuer or Swingline Lender as a result of any judgment 
of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender, the L/C Issuer 
or Swingline Lender against that Defaulting Lender as a result of that 
Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under this Agreement; 
seventh, so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment 
of any amounts owing to the applicable Borrower as a result of any judgment 
of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the applicable Borrower 
against that Defaulting Lender as a result of that Defaulting Lenders 
breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and eighth, to that 
Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent 
jurisdiction; provided that if such payment is a payment of the principal 
amount of any Loans or L/C Borrowings in respect of which that Defaulting 
Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share, such payment shall be 
applied solely to pay the Loans of, and L/C Borrowings owed to, all 
non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the 
payment of any Loans of, or L/C Borrowings owed to, that Defaulting Lender. 
Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting 
Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting 
Lender or to post Cash Collateral pursuant to this Section 2.22(v) shall be 
deemed paid to and redirected by that Defaulting Lender, and each Lender 
irrevocably consents hereto.

(vi)    Certain Fees. (A) No Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive 
any Commitment Fee for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting 
Lender.

(B)    Each Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive L/C 
Participation Fees for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting 
Lender only to the extent allocable to its pro rata share of the stated 
amount of Letters of Credit for which it has provided Cash Collateral.

(C)    With respect to any Commitment Fee or L/C Participation Fee not 
required to be paid to any Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (vi)(A) or 
(B) above, the
 
121

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Borrowers shall (x) pay to each Non-Defaulting Lender that portion of any 
such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender with respect to such 
Defaulting Lenders participation in Letters of Credit or Swingline Loans 
that has been reallocated to such Non-Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause 
(vii) below, (y) pay to each L/C Issuer and the Swingline Lender, as 
applicable, the amount of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting 
Lender to the extent allocable to such L/C Issuers or the Swingline 
Lenders Fronting Exposure to such Defaulting Lender, and (z) not be 
required to pay the remaining amount of any such fee.

(vii)    Reallocation of Participations to Reduce Fronting Exposure. All or 
any part of such Defaulting Lenders participation in Letters of Credit and 
Swingline Loans shall be reallocated among the Non-Defaulting Lenders of 
the applicable Revolving Facility in accordance with their respective pro 
rata Commitments under such Revolving Facility (calculated without regard 
to such Defaulting Lenders Commitment) but only to the extent that (x) the 
conditions set forth in Section 4.01 are satisfied at the time of such 
reallocation and (y) such reallocation does not cause the aggregate 
Revolving Facility Credit Exposure of any Non-Defaulting Lender under such 
Revolving Facility to exceed such Non-Defaulting Lenders Revolving 
Facility Commitment. No under such Revolving Facility. Subject to Section 
9.24, no reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any 
claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that 
Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a 
Non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such Non-Defaulting Lenders increased 
exposure following such reallocation.

(viii)    Defaulting Lender Cure. If the Borrowers, the Administrative 
Agent, Swingline Lender and the L/C Issuer agree in writing in their sole 
discretion that a Defaulting Lender should no longer be deemed to be a 
Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties 
hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and 
subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements 
with respect to any Cash Collateral), that Lender will, to the extent 
applicable, purchase at par that portion of outstanding Loans of the other 
Lenders or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may 
determine to be necessary to cause the Revolving Facility Loans and funded 
and unfunded participations in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans under 
the applicable Revolving Facility to be held on a pro rata basis by the 
Lenders in accordance with their Revolving Facility Percentages under such 
Revolving Facility (without giving effect to Section 2.22(i)), whereupon 
that Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that no 
adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or 
payments made by or on behalf of any Borrower while that Lender was a 
Defaulting Lender; and provided, further, that except to the extent 
otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder 
from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any 
claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lenders having been a 
Defaulting Lender.

SECTION 2.23.     Conversion of Revolving Facility Commitments.

(a)      Any Revolving Facility Lender holding Initial Revolving Facility 
Commitments may, at any time, elect to convert its Initial Revolving 
Facility Commitments and Initial Revolving Loans outstanding thereunder 
into First Amendment Revolving Facility Commitments and First Amendment 
Revolving Facility Loans, respectively, by delivery of written notice to 
the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent in form and
 
122

------------------------------------------------------------------------
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Borrowers and the Administrative 
Agent. Such notice shall specify (i) the amount of such Revolving Facility 
Lenders Initial Revolving Facility Commitments (and proportional amount of 
Initial Revolving Facility Loans) such Revolving Facility Lender so desires 
to convert and (ii) the effective date for such conversion, which shall be 
a date no less than 3 Business Days and no greater than 10 Business Days 
after the date of receipt of such notice by the Borrower and the 
Administrative Agent.

(b)     The Administrative Agent is authorized and directed to mark the 
Register to reflect such conversion upon the effective date thereof and the 
Borrowers and the Administrative Agent may, without the consent of any 
other Lender, make such technical amendments to this Agreement and the 
other Loan Documents as shall be reasonably necessary to effectuate such 
conversion.

(c)      On the effective date of any such conversion, subject to the 
satisfaction of the foregoing terms and conditions, each of the Revolving 
Facility Lenders with First Amendment Revolving Facility Commitments shall 
purchase from each of the other Revolving Facility Lenders with First 
Amendment Revolving Facility Commitments, at the principal amount thereof 
and in the applicable currencies, such interests in the First Amendment 
Revolving Facility Loans and participations in Letters of Credit and 
Swingline Borrowings under the First Amendment Revolving Facility 
Commitments then outstanding on such date as shall be necessary in order 
that, after giving effect to all such assignments and purchases, the First 
Amendment Revolving Facility Loans and participations in Letters of Credit 
and Swingline Borrowings under the First Amendment Revolving Facility 
Commitments will be held by the Revolving Facility Lenders thereunder 
ratably in accordance with their Revolving Facility Percentages under the 
First Amendment Revolving Facility Commitments.

legal, valid and enforceable Lien on all of the applicable Loan Parties 
right, title and interest in and to the Mortgaged Property thereunder and 
the proceeds thereof, and when such Mortgages are filed or recorded in the 
proper real estate filing or recording offices, and all relevant mortgage 
taxes and recording charges are duly paid, the Collateral Agent (for the

Lien of any other person, except for Permitted Liens.

(d)    Notwithstanding anything herein (including this Section 3.17) or in 
any other Loan Document to the contrary, (i) each of the parties hereto 
acknowledges and agrees that licensing by the Gaming Authorities may be 
required to enforce and/or exercise or foreclose upon certain security 
interests and such enforcement and/or exercise or foreclosure may be 
otherwise limited by the Gaming Laws and (ii) no Loan Party makes any 
representation or warranty as to the effects of perfection or 
non-perfection, the priority or the enforceability of any pledge of or 
security interest in any Equity Interests of any Foreign Subsidiary, or as 
to the rights and remedies of the Agents or any Lender with respect 
thereto, under foreign law.

SECTION 3.18.    Location of Real Property and Leased Premises.

(a)    The Perfection Certificate completely and correctly identifies, in 
all material respects, as of the Closing Date all material Real Property

fee all the Real Property set forth as being owned by them in the 
Perfection Certificate except to the extent set forth therein.
 
130

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(b)    The Perfection Certificate lists correctly in all material respects, 
as of the Closing Date, all material Real Property that is leased by the 
Loan Parties as the lessee and the addresses thereof. As of the Closing 
Date, the Loan Parties have in all material respects valid leases in all 
the Real Property set forth as being leased by them as the lessee in the 
Perfection Certificate except to the extent set forth therein.

SECTION 3.19.    Solvency.

(a)    On the Closing Date, immediately after giving effect to the 
Transactions, (i) the fair value of the assets of the Borrowers and the 
Subsidiaries on a combined or consolidated basis, at a fair valuation, will 
exceed the debts and liabilities, direct, subordinated, contingent or 
otherwise, of the Borrowers and the Subsidiaries on a combined or 
consolidated basis; (ii) the present fair saleable value of the property of 
the Borrowers and the Subsidiaries on a combined or consolidated basis will 
be greater than the amount that will be required to pay the probable 
liability of the Borrowers and the Subsidiaries on a combined or 
consolidated basis on their debts and other liabilities, direct, 
subordinated, contingent or otherwise, as such debts and other liabilities 
become absolute and matured; (iii) the Borrowers and the Subsidiaries on a 
combined or consolidated basis will be able to pay their debts and 
liabilities, direct, subordinated, contingent or otherwise, as such debts 
and liabilities become absolute and matured; and (iv) the Borrowers and the

such subsidiary and the timing and amounts of cash to be payable on or in 
respect of its Indebtedness or the Indebtedness of any such subsidiary.

SECTION 3.20.    Labor Matters. Except as, individually or in the 
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse 
Effect: (a) there are no strikes or other labor disputes pending or 
threatened against any Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries; (b) the hours 
worked and payments made to employees of the Borrowers and the Subsidiaries 
have not been in violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act or any other

Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries or for which any claim may be made 
against any Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries, on account of wages and 
employee health and welfare insurance and other benefits have been paid or 
accrued as a liability on the books of such Borrower or such Subsidiary to 
the extent required by GAAP. Except as, individually or in the aggregate, 
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, the 
consummation of the Transactions will not give rise to a right of 
termination or right of renegotiation on the part of any union under any 
material collective bargaining agreement to which any Borrower or any of 
the Subsidiaries (or any predecessor) is a party or by which any Borrower 
or any of the Subsidiaries (or any predecessor) is bound.
 
131

and is continuing or would result from the consummation of the transactions 
contemplated by this Agreement or any other Loan Document.

reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect and except as set

owns, or possesses the right to use, all of the patents, trademarks, 
service marks or trade names, copyrights or mask works, domain names, data,

foregoing (collectively, Intellectual Property Rights) that are 
reasonably necessary for the operation of their respective businesses, (b) 
to the best knowledge of the Borrowers, the Borrowers and the Subsidiaries 
are not interfering with, infringing upon, misappropriating or otherwise 
violating Intellectual Property Rights of any person, and (c) no claim or 
litigation regarding any of the foregoing is pending or, to the knowledge 
of the Borrowers, threatened.

SECTION 3.23.    Senior Debt. The Obligations constitute Senior Debt (or 
the equivalent thereof) and Designated Senior Debt (or the equivalent 
thereof, if any) under the documentation governing any Material 
Indebtedness of any Loan Party permitted to be incurred hereunder 
constituting Indebtedness that is subordinated in right of payment to the 
Loan Obligations.

SECTION 3.24.    Anti-Money Laundering and Economic Sanctions Laws.

(a)    As of the Closing Date, to the knowledge of senior management of 
each Loan Party, no Loan Party, none of its Subsidiaries, none of its 
controlled Affiliates and none of the respective officers, directors, 
brokers or agents of such Loan Party, such Subsidiary or controlled 
Affiliate has violated or is in violation of any applicable Anti-Money 
Laundering Law.

(b)    To the knowledge of senior management of each Loan Party, no Loan 
Party, none of its Subsidiaries, none of its controlled Affiliates and none 
of the respective officers, directors, brokers or agents of such Loan 
Party, such Subsidiary or such controlled Affiliate that is acting or 
benefiting in any capacity in connection with the Loans (i) is an Embargoed 
Person or (ii) except as otherwise authorized by OFAC, otherwise permitted 
for U.S. persons by a U.S. Governmental Authority or by any rule, 
regulation or order of a U.S. Governmental Authority, will use any proceeds 
of the Loans or Letters of Credit, or lend, contribute or otherwise make 
available such proceeds to any Person for the purpose of financing the 
activities of or with any Person or in any country or territory that, at 
the time of funding or facilitation, is an Embargoed Person.

(c)    No part of the proceeds of the Loans will be used, directly or 
indirectly, for any payments to any governmental official or employee, 
political party, official of a political party, candidate for political 
office, or anyone else acting in an official capacity, in order to obtain, 
retain or direct business or obtain any improper advantage, in violation of 
the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended.
 
132

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(d)     None of the Borrowers or any of their Subsidiaries (i) is a person 
whose property or interest in property is blocked or subject to blocking

ARTICLE V
Affirmative Covenants

Each of the Borrowers covenants and agrees with each Lender that until the 
Termination Date, unless the Required Lenders shall otherwise consent in 
writing, the Borrowers will, and will cause each of the Subsidiaries to:

SECTION 5.01.    Existence; Businesses and Properties.

(a)    Do or cause to be done all things necessary to preserve, renew and 
keep in full force and effect its legal existence, except, in the case of a 
Subsidiary of a Borrower, where the failure to do so would not reasonably 
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, and except as otherwise 
permitted under Section 6.05; provided that any Borrower may liquidate or 
dissolve one or more Borrowers (other than the Company) or Subsidiaries if 
the assets of such Borrower or Subsidiaries (to the extent they exceed 
estimated liabilities) are acquired by a Borrower or a Wholly-Owned 
Subsidiary of a Borrower in such liquidation or dissolution, except that 
Borrowers and Subsidiary Loan Parties may not be liquidated into 
Subsidiaries that are not Loan Parties and Domestic Subsidiaries may not be 
liquidated into Foreign Subsidiaries (except in each case as otherwise 
permitted under Section 6.05).

(b)    Except where the failure to do so would not reasonably be expected 
to have a Material Adverse Effect, do or cause to be done all things 
necessary to (i) lawfully obtain, preserve, renew, extend and keep in full 
force and effect the permits, franchises, authorizations, patents, 
trademarks, service marks, trade names, copyrights, licenses and rights 
with respect thereto necessary to the normal conduct of its business, and 
(ii) at all times maintain and preserve all property necessary to the 
normal conduct of its business and keep such property in good repair, 
working order and condition (ordinary wear and tear excepted), from time to 
time make, or cause to be made, all needful and proper repairs, renewals, 
additions, improvements and replacements thereto necessary in order that 
the business carried on in connection therewith, if any, may be properly 
conducted at all times (in each case except as permitted by this 
Agreement).
 
136

------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 5.02.    Insurance.

(a)    Maintain, with financially sound and reputable insurance companies, 
insurance (subject to customary deductibles and retentions) in such amounts 
and against such risks as are customarily maintained by similarly situated 
companies engaged in the same or similar businesses operating in the same 
or similar locations and cause the Loan Parties to be listed as insured and 
the Collateral Agent to be listed as a co-loss payee on property and 
property casualty policies and as an additional insured on liability 
policies. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrowers and the Subsidiaries 
may self-insure with respect to such risks with respect to which companies 
of established reputation engaged in the same general line of business in 
the same general area usually self-insure.

(b)    With respect to any Mortgaged Properties, if at any time the area in 
which the Premises (as defined in the Mortgages) are located is designated 
a flood hazard area in any Flood Insurance Rate Map published by the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency (or any successor agency) Borrowers and 
the Subsidiaries shall obtain flood insurance to the extent required to 
comply with the National Flood Insurance Program as set forth in the Flood 
Disaster Protection Act of 1973, as it may be amended from time to time.

(c)    In connection with the covenants set forth in this Section 5.02, it 
is understood and agreed that:

(i)    none of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders, the L/C Issuer and 
their respective agents or employees shall be liable for any loss or damage 
insured by the insurance policies required to be maintained under this 
Section 5.02, it being understood that (A) the Loan Parties shall look 
solely to their insurance companies or any other parties other than the 
aforesaid parties for the recovery of such loss or damage and (B) such 
insurance companies shall have no rights of subrogation against the 
Administrative Agent, the Lenders, any L/C Issuer or their agents or 
employees. If, however, the insurance policies, as a matter of the internal 
policy of such insurer, do not provide waiver of subrogation rights against 
such parties, as required above, then each Borrower, on behalf of itself 
and behalf of its Subsidiaries, hereby agrees, to the extent permitted by 
law, to waive, and further agrees to cause each of its Subsidiaries to 
waive, its right of recovery, if any, against the Administrative Agent, the 
Lenders, any L/C Issuer and their agents and employees;

(ii)    the designation of any form, type or amount of insurance coverage 
by the Administrative Agent under this Section 5.02 shall in no event be 
deemed a representation, warranty or advice by the Administrative Agent or 
the Lenders that such insurance is adequate for the purposes of the 
business of the Borrowers and the Subsidiaries or the protection of their 
properties; and
 
137

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(iii)    the amount and type of insurance that the Borrowers and its 
Subsidiaries has in effect as of the Closing Date satisfies for all 
purposes the requirements of this Section 5.02.

SECTION 5.03.    Taxes. Pay and discharge promptly when due all Taxes, 
imposed upon it or upon its income or profits or in respect of its 
property, before the same shall become delinquent or in default, as well as 
all material lawful claims which, if unpaid, might give rise to a Lien 
(other than a Permitted Lien) upon such properties or any part thereof; 
provided, however, that such payment and discharge shall not be required 
with respect to any such Tax, assessment, charge, levy or claim where (a) 
the validity or amount thereof is being contested in good faith by 
appropriate proceedings and the Borrowers or the affected Subsidiary, as 
applicable, shall have set aside on its books adequate reserves in 
accordance with GAAP with respect thereto or (b) the failure to make 
payment could not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, 
to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

SECTION 5.04.    Financial Statements, Reports, etc. Furnish to the 
Administrative Agent (which will promptly furnish such information to the 
Lenders):

(a)    Within 105 days (or such other time period as specified in the SECs

consolidated results of their operations during such year and setting forth 
in comparative form the corresponding figures for the prior fiscal year, 
which combined or consolidated balance sheet and related statements of 
operations, cash flows and owners equity shall be audited by independent 
public accountants of recognized national standing and accompanied by an

scope of audit or as to the status of any Borrower or any Material 
Subsidiary as a going concern, other than solely with respect to, or 
resulting solely from an upcoming maturity date under any series of 
Indebtedness occurring within one year from the time such opinion is 
delivered) to the effect that such combined or consolidated financial 
statements fairly present, in all material respects, the financial position 
and results of operations of the Borrowers and the Subsidiaries on a 
combined or consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP (it being understood 
that the delivery by CERP LLC of annual reports on Form 10-K of the 
Borrowers and their combined or consolidated Subsidiaries shall satisfy the 
requirements of this Section 5.04(a) to the extent such annual reports 
include the information specified herein);

delivered hereunder, within 75 days following the end of such fiscal 
quarter), following the end of each of the first three fiscal quarters of 
each fiscal year (commencing with the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 
2013), a combined or consolidated balance sheet and related statements of 
operations and cash flows

figures for the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year, all of 
which shall be in reasonable detail and which combined or consolidated 
balance sheet and related statements of operations and cash flows shall be 
certified by a Financial Officer of CERP LLC on behalf of the Borrowers as 
fairly presenting, in all material respects, the financial position and 
results of operations of the Borrowers and the Subsidiaries on a combined 
or consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP (subject to normal year-end 
audit adjustments and the absence of footnotes) (it being understood that 
the delivery by CERP LLC of quarterly reports on Form 10-Q of the Borrowers 
and their combined or consolidated Subsidiaries shall satisfy the 
requirements of this Section 5.04(b) to the extent such quarterly reports 
include the information specified herein);

actions required to be taken pursuant to this paragraph (c).

(d)    If any additional direct or indirect Subsidiary of any Borrower is 
formed or acquired after the Closing Date (with any Subsidiary 
Redesignation resulting in an Unrestricted Subsidiary becoming a Subsidiary

to constitute the acquisition of a Subsidiary) and if such Subsidiary 
constitutes a first tier Foreign Subsidiary of a Loan Party, within 
fifteen (15) Business Days after the date such Foreign Subsidiary is formed 
or acquired (or such longer period as the Collateral Agent may agree), 
notify the Collateral Agent thereof and, within twenty (20) Business Days 
after the date such Foreign Subsidiary is formed or acquired or such longer 
period as the Collateral Agent shall agree, cause the Collateral 
Requirement to be satisfied with respect to any Equity Interest in such 
Foreign Subsidiary owned by or on behalf of any Loan Party, subject in each 
case to paragraph (g) below.

(f)    Furnish to the Collateral Agent promptly (and in any event within 30 
days after such change) written notice of any change (A) in any Loan

organizational structure, (C) in any Loan Partys organizational 
identification number or (D) in any Loan Partys jurisdiction of

Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries as a lessee under a lease or any Real

contemplation or in connection with the acquisition of such assets (except 
in the case of assets (A) owned on the Closing Date or (B) acquired after 
the Closing Date with Indebtedness of the type permitted pursuant to 
clauses (i) or (j) of Section 6.01) (in each case, except to the extent 
such prohibition is unenforceable after giving effect to the applicable 
anti-assignment provisions of Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code of 
any applicable jurisdiction), (iv) assets to the extent a security interest 
in such assets could reasonably be expected to result in material adverse 
tax consequences (as determined in good faith by the Borrowers), (v) those 
assets as to which the Collateral Agent and the Borrowers reasonably agree 
that the costs or other consequence of obtaining or perfecting such a 
security interest or perfection thereof are excessive in relation to the 
value of the security to be afforded thereby, (vi) any lease, license or 
other agreement to the extent that a grant of a security interest therein 
would violate or invalidate such lease, license or agreement or create a 
right of termination in favor of any other party thereto (other than a 
Borrower or any other Loan Party) after giving effect to the applicable 
anti-assignment provisions of Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code, 
(vii) any governmental licenses (including gaming licenses) or state or

any Special Purpose Receivables Subsidiary or any other asset securing any 
Qualified Non-Recourse Debt or any Permitted Receivables Financing (which 
shall in no event constitute Collateral hereunder, nor shall any Qualified 
Non-Recourse Subsidiary or Special Purpose Receivables Subsidiary be a Loan 
Party hereunder); provided, that the Borrowers may in their sole discretion 
elect to exclude any property from the definition of Excluded Property.

expense by the time or times at which it would otherwise be required by 
this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, (ii) no foreign law governed 
security documents shall be required, (iii) Liens required to be granted 
from time to time pursuant to the Collateral Requirement and the Security 
Documents shall be subject to exceptions and limitations set forth in the

jurisdiction, as otherwise agreed between the Administrative Agent and the 
Company, (iv) to the extent any Mortgaged Property is located in a 
jurisdiction with mortgage recording or similar tax, the amount secured by 
the Security Document with respect to such Mortgaged Property shall be 
limited to the fair market value of such Mortgaged Property as determined 
in good faith by the Borrowers (subject to any applicable laws in the 
relevant jurisdiction or such lesser amount agreed to by the Collateral 
Agent) and (v) there shall be no control, lockbox or similar arrangements 
nor any control agreements relating to the Borrowers and their 
subsidiaries bank accounts (including deposit, securities or commodities 
accounts).

principal amount of Term Loans, Revolving Facility Commitments and First 
Lien Notes outstanding immediately prior to such issuance, incurrence or 
assumption and (2) the Refinancing Amount in connection with such issuance, 
incurrence or assumption and (ii) Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness in 
respect thereof;

(gg)    Obligations in respect of Cash Management Agreements;

(hh)    to the extent constituting Indebtedness, agreements to pay service 
fees to professionals (including architects, engineers and designers) in 
furtherance of and/or in connection with any project, in each case to the 
extent such agreements and related payment provisions are reasonably

For purposes of determining compliance with this Section 6.01, the amount 
of any Indebtedness denominated in any currency other than Dollars shall be 
calculated based on customary currency exchange rates in effect, in the 
case of such Indebtedness incurred (in respect of term Indebtedness) or 
committed (in respect of revolving Indebtedness) on or prior to the Closing 
Date, on the Closing Date and, in the case of such Indebtedness incurred 
(in respect of term Indebtedness) or committed (in respect of revolving 
Indebtedness) after the Closing Date, on the date that such Indebtedness 
was incurred (in respect of term Indebtedness) or committed (in respect of 
revolving Indebtedness); provided that if such Indebtedness is incurred to 
refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than Dollars 
(or in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced), and 
such refinancing would cause the applicable Dollar-denominated restriction 
to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in 
effect on the date of such refinancing, such Dollar-denominated restriction 
shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount 
of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed (i) the outstanding or 
committed principal amount, as applicable, of such Indebtedness being 
refinanced plus (ii) the aggregate amount of fees, underwriting discounts, 
premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance costs and other costs and 
expenses incurred in connection with such refinancing.

For purposes of determining compliance with Section 6.01 and the 
calculation of the Incremental Amount, if the use of proceeds from any 
incurrence, issuance or assumption of Indebtedness is to fund the 
Refinancing of any Indebtedness, then such Refinancing shall be deemed to 
have occurred substantially simultaneously with such incurrence, issuance 
or
 
153

------------------------------------------------------------------------
assumption so long as (1) such Refinancing occurs on the same Business Day 
as such incurrence, issuance or assumption, (2) if such proceeds will be 
offered (through a tender offer or otherwise) to the holders of such 
Indebtedness to be Refinanced, the proceeds thereof are deposited with a 
trustee, agent or other representative for such holders pending the 
completion of such offer on the same Business Day as such incurrence, 
issuance or assumption (and such proceeds are ultimately used in the 
consummation of such offer or otherwise used to Refinance Indebtedness), 
(3) if such proceeds will be used to fund the redemption, discharge or 
defeasance of such Indebtedness to be Refinanced, the proceeds thereof are 
deposited with a trustee, agent or other representative for such 
Indebtedness pending such redemption, discharge or defeasance on the same 
Business Day as such incurrence, issuance or assumption or (4) the proceeds 
thereof are otherwise set aside to fund such Refinancing pursuant to 
procedures reasonably agreed with the Administrative Agent.

Further, for purposes of determining compliance with this Section 6.01, (A) 
Indebtedness need not be permitted solely by reference to one category of 
permitted Indebtedness described in Sections 6.01(a) through (ii) but may 
be permitted in part under any combination thereof and (B) in the event 
that an item of Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) meets the criteria of 
one or more of the categories of permitted Indebtedness described in 
Sections 6.01(a) through (ii), any Borrower shall, in its sole discretion, 
classify or reclassify, or later divide, classify or reclassify, such item 
of Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) in any manner that complies with 
this Section 6.01 and will only be required to include the amount and type 
of such item of Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) in one of the above 
clauses and such item of Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) shall be 
treated as having been incurred or existing pursuant to only one of such 
clauses, provided, that all Indebtedness under this Agreement outstanding 
on the Closing Date shall at all times be deemed to have been incurred 
pursuant to clause (b) of this Section 6.01 and may not be reclassified. In 
addition, with respect to any Indebtedness that was permitted to be 
incurred hereunder on the date of such incurrence, any Increased Amount of 
such Indebtedness shall also be permitted hereunder after the date of such 
incurrence.

thereof, or except from the failure of the Collateral Agent to maintain 
possession of certificates actually delivered to it representing securities 
pledged under the Collateral Agreement or to file Uniform Commercial Code

respect to gaming operations at any gaming facility of any Borrower or any 
Subsidiary that continues for 30 calendar days to the extent that such 
License Revocation, together with all prior License Revocations that are 
still in effect, would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse 
Effect,

then, and in every such event (other than an event with respect to the 
Company described in paragraph (h) or (i) above), and at any time 
thereafter during the continuance of such event, the Administrative Agent, 
at the request of the Required Lenders, shall, by notice to the Borrowers, 
take any or all of the following actions, at the same or different times: 
(i) terminate forthwith the Commitments, (ii) declare the Loans then

contained in Section 7.01, in the event that the Borrowers fail (or, but 
for the operation of this Section 7.02, would fail) to comply with the 
requirements of the Financial Performance Covenant, until the expiration of 
the 20th day subsequent to the date the certificate calculating such 
Financial Performance Covenant is required to be delivered pursuant to 
Section 5.04(c), any Parent Entity and/or the Company shall have the right 
to issue Permitted Cure Securities for cash or otherwise receive cash 
contributions to the capital of any Parent Entity and/or the Company (and,

upon the receipt by the Company of such cash (the Cure Amount) pursuant 
to the exercise by any Parent Entity and/or the Company of such Cure Right 
such Financial Performance Covenant shall be recalculated giving effect to 
a pro forma adjustment by which EBITDA shall be increased with respect to 
such applicable quarter and any four-quarter period that contains such 
quarter, solely for the purpose of measuring the Financial Performance 
Covenant and not for any other purpose under this Agreement, by an amount 
equal to the Cure Amount; provided, that, (i) in each four-fiscal-quarter 
period there shall be at least one fiscal quarter in which the Cure Right 
is not exercised and (ii) for purposes

------------------------------------------------------------------------
of this Section 7.02, the Cure Amount shall be no greater than the amount 
required for purposes of complying with the Financial Performance Covenant. 
If, after giving effect to the adjustments in this paragraph, the Borrowers 
shall then be in compliance with the requirements of the Financial 
Performance Covenant, the Borrowers shall be deemed to have satisfied the 
requirements of the Financial Performance Covenant as of the relevant date 
of determination with the same effect as though there had been no failure 
to comply therewith at such date, and the applicable breach or default of 
the Financial Performance Covenant that had occurred shall be deemed cured 
for this purposes of the Agreement.

agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement or any other Loan 
Document, or to inspect the properties, books or records of any Loan Party.

SECTION 8.04.    Reliance by Agents. The Administrative Agent and the 
Collateral Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in 
relying, upon any writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate,

of Default and stating that such notice is a notice of default. In the 
event that the Administrative Agent receives such a notice, it shall give 
notice thereof to the Lenders and the Collateral Agent. The Administrative 
Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of 
Default as shall be reasonably directed by the Required Lenders, provided

interests of the Lenders except to the extent that this Agreement requires

Other Lenders. Each Lender expressly acknowledges that neither the 
Administrative Agent nor the Collateral Agent nor any of their respective 
officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates has 
made any representations or warranties to it and that no act by the 
Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent hereinafter taken, including any 
review of the affairs of any Loan Party, shall be deemed to constitute any 
representation or warranty by the Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent 
to any Lender, the Swingline Lender or any L/C Issuer. Each Lender, the 
Swingline Lender and each L/C Issuer represents to the Administrative Agent 
and the Collateral Agent that it has, independently and without reliance

property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Loan 
Parties and made its own decision to make its Loans hereunder and enter 
into this Agreement. Each Lender also represents that it will,

Collateral Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and 
information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its 
own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking 
action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to make such 
investigation as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, 
operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of 
the Loan Parties. Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly 
required to be furnished to the Lenders by the Administrative Agent 
hereunder, neither the Administrative Agent nor the Collateral Agent shall 
have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or 
other information concerning the business, assets, operations, properties,

Agent any of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, 
attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates.

SECTION 8.07.    Indemnification. The Lenders agree to indemnify the 
Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent, each in its capacity as such

respective portions of the total Term Loans and Revolving Facility 
Commitments (or, if the Revolving Facility Commitments shall have

suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever that may at 
any time (including at any time following the payment of the Loans) be 
imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent or the 
Collateral Agent in any way relating to or arising out of the Commitments, 
this Agreement, any of the other Loan Documents, or any documents 
contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions 
contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted by the 
Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent under or in connection with 
any of the foregoing, provided that no Lender shall be liable for the 
payment of any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, 
penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements 
resulting from the Administrative Agents or the Collateral Agents gross 
negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a final judgment of a 
court of competent jurisdiction. The agreements in this Section 8.07 shall 
survive the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.

SECTION 8.08.    Agents in their Individual Capacity. The Administrative 
Agent, the Collateral Agent and their Affiliates may make loans to, accept 
deposits from and generally engage in any kind of business with any Loan 
Party as though such persons were not the Administrative Agent and 
Collateral Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents. With respect 
to the Loans made by it, the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent 
shall each have the same rights and powers under this Agreement and the 
other Loan Documents as any Lender and may exercise the same as though it 
were not the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, and the terms 
Lender and Lenders shall include the Administrative Agent and the 
Collateral Agent in their individual capacities.

SECTION 8.09.    Successor Agents. Each of the Administrative Agent and 
Collateral Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the 
Lenders, the L/C Issuer and the Borrowers. Upon receipt of any such notice 
of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, subject to the 
reasonable consent of the Borrowers so long as no Event of Default under 
Section 7.01(h) or (i) is continuing, to appoint a successor, which shall 
be a bank with an office in the United States, or an Affiliate of any such 
bank with an office in the United States. If no such successor shall have 
been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such 
appointment within 30 days after the retiring Agent gives notice of its 
resignation, then the retiring Agent may on behalf of the Lenders and the 
L/C Issuer, appoint a successor Agent meeting the qualifications set forth 
above; provided that if the retiring Agent shall notify the Borrowers and 
the Lenders that no qualifying person has accepted such appointment, then 
such resignation shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such 
notice and (1) the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and 
obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (except in the 
case of the Collateral Agent holding collateral security on behalf of any 
Secured Parties, the retiring Collateral Agent shall continue to hold such 
collateral security as nominee until such time as a successor Collateral 
Agent is appointed) and (2) all payments, communications and determinations 
provided to be made by, to or through such Agent shall instead be made by 
or to each Lender and the L/C Issuer directly, until such time as the 
Required Lenders appoint a successor Agent as provided for above in this 
Section. Upon the acceptance of a successors appointment as the 
Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as the case may be, hereunder, 
such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, 
powers, privileges and duties of the retiring (or retired) Agent, and the 
retiring Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations 
hereunder or under the other Loan Documents (if not
 
186

------------------------------------------------------------------------
already discharged therefrom as provided above in this Section). The fees 
payable by the Borrowers (following the effectiveness of such appointment) 
to such Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless 
otherwise agreed between the Borrowers and such successor. After the 
retiring Agents resignation hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, 
the provisions of this Article VIII and Section 9.05 shall continue in 
effect for the benefit of such retiring Agent, its sub-agents and their 
respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be 
taken by any of them while the retiring Agent was acting as an Agent.

Any resignation by Citibank as Administrative Agent pursuant to this 
Section shall also constitute its resignation as L/C Issuer and Swingline 
Lender. Upon the acceptance of a successors appointment as Administrative 
Agent hereunder, (a) such successor shall succeed to and become vested with 
all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring L/C Issuer 
and Swingline Lender, (b) the retiring L/C Issuer and Swingline Lender 
shall be discharged from all of their respective duties and obligations 
hereunder or under the other Loan Documents, and (c) the successor L/C 
Issuer shall issue letters of credit in substitution for the Letters of 
Credit, if any, outstanding at the time of such succession or make other 
arrangements satisfactory to the retiring L/C Issuer to effectively assume 
the obligations of the retiring L/C Issuer with respect to such Letters of 
Credit.

SECTION 8.10.    Payments Set Aside. To the extent that any payment by or 
on behalf of the Borrowers is made to the Administrative Agent, the L/C 
Issuer or any Lender, or the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or any 
Lender exercises its right of setoff, and such payment or the proceeds of 
such setoff or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be 
fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to 
any settlement entered into by the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or 
such Lender in its discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any 
other party, in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law 
or otherwise, then (a) to the extent of such recovery, the obligation or 
part thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be revived and 
continued in full force and effect as if such payment had not been made or 
such setoff had not occurred, and (b) each Lender and the L/C Issuer 
severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent upon demand its 
applicable share (without duplication) of any amount so recovered from or 
repaid by the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of 
such demand to the date such payment is made at a rate per annum equal to 
the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect, in the 
applicable currency of such recovery or payment. The obligations of the 
Lenders and the L/C Issuer under clause (b) of the preceding sentence shall 
survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this 
Agreement.

SECTION 8.11.    Administrative Agent May File Proofs of Claim. In case of 
the pendency of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or any other 
judicial proceeding relative to any Loan Party, the Administrative Agent 
(irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan or L/C Obligation shall 
then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise 
and irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any 
demand on any Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in 
such proceeding or otherwise

(i)    to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and 
interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans, L/C Obligations and all 
other Obligations that
 
187

------------------------------------------------------------------------
are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary 
or advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders, the L/C Issuer and 
the Administrative Agent (including any claim for the reasonable 
compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Lenders, the L/C 
Issuer and the Administrative Agent and their respective agents and counsel 
and all other amounts due the Lenders, the L/C Issuer and the 
Administrative Agent under Article II or Section 9.05) allowed in such 
judicial proceeding; and

(ii)    to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or 
deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;

and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or 
other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized 
by each Lender and the L/C Issuer to make such payments to the 
Administrative Agent and, if the Administrative Agent shall consent to the 
making of such payments directly to the Lenders and the L/C Issuer, to pay 
to the Administrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, 
expenses, disbursements and advances of the Administrative Agent and its 
agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Administrative Agent 
under Article II and Section 9.05.

Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative 
Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender 
or the L/C Issuer any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or 
composition affecting the Obligations or the rights of any Lender or the 
L/C Issuer to authorize the Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the 
claim of any Lender or the L/C Issuer or in any such proceeding.

SECTION 8.12.    Collateral and Guaranty Matters. The Lenders and the L/C 
Issuer irrevocably authorize the Collateral Agent, at its option and in its 
discretion, to release any Lien on any property granted to or held by the 
Collateral Agent under any Loan Document if approved, authorized or 
ratified in writing in accordance with Section 9.08, or pursuant to Section 
5.11 or Section 9.18. Upon request by the Collateral Agent at any time, the 
Required Lenders will confirm in writing the Collateral Agents authority 
to release its interest in particular types or items of property in 
accordance with this Section.

SECTION 8.13.    Agents and Arrangers. None of the Syndication Agents, the 
Documentation Agents nor any of the Co-Lead Arrangers shall have any duties 
or responsibilities hereunder in its capacity as such.

SECTION 8.14.    First Lien Intercreditor Agreement and Collateral Matters
. The Lenders hereby agree to the terms of the First Lien Intercreditor 
Agreement and acknowledge that Citibank (and any successor Collateral Agent 
under the Security Documents and the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement) 
will be serving as Collateral Agent for both the Secured Parties and the 
other First Lien Secured Parties under the Security Documents and the First 
Lien Intercreditor Agreement. Each Lender hereby consents to Citibank and 
any successor serving in such capacity and agrees not to assert any claim 
(including as a result of any conflict of interest) against Citibank, or 
any such successor, arising from the role of the Collateral Agent under the 
Security Documents or the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement so long as the 
Collateral Agent is either acting in accordance with the express terms of 
such documents or otherwise has
 
188

------------------------------------------------------------------------
not engaged in gross negligence or willful misconduct. Each Borrower and 
each Lender hereby agrees that the resignation provisions set forth in the 
First Lien Intercreditor Agreement with respect to the Collateral Agent 
shall supersede any provision of this Agreement to the contrary. In 
addition, the Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent shall be authorized 
from time to time, without the consent of any Lender, to execute or to 
enter into amendments of, and amendments and restatements of, the First 
Lien Intercreditor Agreement, the Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement 
and/or any additional and replacement intercreditor agreements, in each 
case in order to effect the pari passu treatment or the subordination of 
and to provide for certain additional rights, obligations and limitations 
in respect of, any Liens required or permitted by the terms of this 
Agreement to be Liens pari passu with or junior to the Obligations, that 
are, in each case, incurred in accordance with Article VI of this 
Agreement, and to establish certain relative rights as between the holders 
of the Obligations and the holders of the Indebtedness secured by such 
Liens.

SECTION 8.15.    Withholding Tax. To the extent required by any applicable 
laws, the Administrative Agent may withhold from any payment to any Lender 
an amount equivalent to any applicable withholding Tax. Without limiting or 
expanding the provisions of Section 2.17, each Lender shall indemnify and 
hold harmless the Administrative Agent against, and shall make payable in 
respect thereof within 10 days after demand therefor, any and all Taxes and 
any and all related losses, claims, liabilities and expenses (including 
fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for the Administrative 
Agent) incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent by the IRS 
or any other Governmental Authority as a result of the failure of the 
Administrative Agent to properly withhold Tax from amounts paid to or for 
the account of such Lender for any reason (including, without limitation, 
because the appropriate form was not delivered or not properly executed, or 
because such Lender failed to notify the Administrative Agent of a change 
in circumstance that rendered the exemption from, or reduction of, 
withholding Tax ineffective). A certificate as to the amount of such 
payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent 
shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes 
the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any 
time owing to such Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan Document 
against any amount due the Administrative Agent under this Section 8.15. 
The agreements in this Section 8.15 shall survive the resignation and/or 
replacement of the Administrative Agent, any assignment of rights by, or 
the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the 
repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other Obligations. For the 
avoidance of doubt, the term Lender shall, for purposes of this Section 
8.15, include any L/C Issuer.

representations and warranties made by the Loan Parties herein, in the 
other Loan Documents and in the certificates or other instruments prepared 
or delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement or any other

and each L/C Issuer and shall survive the making by the Lenders of the 
Loans, the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents and the issuance of 
the Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by such persons 
or on their behalf, and shall continue in full force and effect until the 
Termination Date. Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreements

has occurred and is continuing, any other person;

(ii)    Assignments shall be subject to the following additional 
conditions:

(A)    except in the case of an assignment to a Lender, an affiliate of a 
Lender or an Approved Fund or an assignment of the entire remaining amount 
of the assigning Lenders Commitments or Loans under any Facility, the

shall not be less than (x) $1.0 million in the case of Term Loans (and 
shall be in an amount of an integral multiple thereof) and (y) $5.0 million 
in the case of Revolving Facility Loans or Revolving Facility Commitments,

Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire and any tax forms 
required to be delivered pursuant to Section 2.17; and

(D)    each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a

(iii)    Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to paragraph 
(b)(v) below, from and after the effective date specified in each 
Assignment and Acceptance the Assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto 
and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and 
Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this 
Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the 
interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, be released from its 
obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and 
Acceptance covering all of the assigning Lenders rights and obligations 
under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but 
shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 
and 9.05. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations 
under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 9.04 shall be 
treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a 
participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with clause (c) 
of this Section 9.04.

(iv)    The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of 
the Borrowers, shall maintain at one of its offices a copy of each 
Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register for the 
recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments 
of, and principal amount of the Loans and L/C Obligations owing to, each 
Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the Register). The 
entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrowers, the 
Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer and the Lenders shall treat each 
person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof 
as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding 
notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by 
the Company, the L/C Issuer and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from 
time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

(v)    Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Acceptance 
executed by an assigning Lender and an Assignee, the Assignees completed 
Administrative Questionnaire (unless the Assignee shall already be a Lender 
hereunder), all applicable tax forms, the processing and recordation fee 
referred to in clause (b) of this Section and any written consent to such 
assignment required by clause (b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent 
promptly shall accept such Assignment and Acceptance and record the

not evidenced by a promissory note, shall be effective for purposes of this 
Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this 
clause (b)(v).
 
193

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(c)    (i) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Company or the 
Administrative Agent, sell participations to one or more banks or other 
entities (a Participant) in all or a portion of such Lenders rights and 
obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its 
Commitments and the Loans owing to it); provided, that (A) such Lenders 
obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (B) such Lender 
shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the 
performance of such obligations and (C) the Borrowers, the Administrative 
Agent, the L/C Issuer and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely 
and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lenders rights and 
obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement pursuant to which a Lender 
sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the 
sole right to enforce this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and to 
approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this 
Agreement and the other Loan Documents; provided, that (x) such agreement 
may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the 
Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver that (1) 
requires the consent of each Lender directly affected thereby pursuant to 
clause (i), (ii), (iii) or (vi) of the first proviso to Section 9.08(b) and 
(2) directly affects such Participant and (y) no other agreement with 
respect to amendment, modification or waiver may exist between such Lender 
and such Participant. Subject to Section 9.04(c)(ii), the Borrowers agree 
that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 
2.16 and 2.17 (subject to the limitations and requirements of those 
Sections and to the extent such Participant complies with Section 2.17(e) 
and (f) as though it were a Lender) to the same extent as if it were a 
Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph 
(b) of this Section 9.04. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant 
also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 9.06 as though it were a 
Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.18(c) 
as though it were a Lender.

(ii)     Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for 
this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrowers, maintain a register 
on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the 
principal and interest amount of each Participants interest in the Loans 
held by it (the Participant Register). The entries in the Participant 
Register shall be conclusive, and such Lender shall treat each person whose 
name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of the 
participation in question for all purposes of this Agreement, 
notwithstanding notice to the contrary; provided that no Lender shall have 
any obligation to disclose all or any portion of a Participant Register to 
any Person (including the identity of any Participant or any information 
relating to a Participants interest in any Commitments, Loans or other 
Obligations under any Loan Document) except to the extent that such 
disclosure is necessary to establish that such Commitment, Loan or other 
Obligation is in registered form for U.S. federal income tax purposes or 
such disclosure is otherwise required by applicable law.

(iii)     A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater 
payment under Section 2.15, 2.16 or 2.17 than the applicable Lender would 
have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to 
such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant 
is made with the Borrowers prior written consent (not to be unreasonably 
withheld), which consent shall state that it is being given pursuant to 
this Section 9.04(c)(iii); provided that each potential Participant shall 
provide such information as is reasonably requested by the Borrowers in 
order for the Borrowers to determine whether to provide their consent.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(d)    Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in 
all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations 
of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to 
a Federal Reserve Bank and in the case of any Lender that is an Approved 
Fund, any pledge or assignment to any holders of obligations owed, or 
securities issued, by such Lender, including to any trustee for, or any 
other representative of, such holders, and this Section 9.04 shall not 
apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided, 
that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a 
Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee 
or Assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

(e)    The Borrowers, upon receipt of written notice from the relevant 
Lender, agree to issue Notes to any Lender requiring Notes to facilitate 
transactions of the type described in paragraph (d) above.

(f)    Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Conduit Lender may assign any or 
all of the Loans it may have funded hereunder to its designating Lender 
without the consent of the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent. Each of 
the Borrowers, each Lender and the Administrative Agent hereby confirms 
that it will not institute against a Conduit Lender or join any other 
person in instituting against a Conduit Lender any bankruptcy, 
reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceeding under any 
state bankruptcy or similar law, for one year and one day after the payment 
in full of the latest maturing commercial paper note issued by such Conduit 
Lender; provided, however, that each Lender designating any Conduit Lender 
hereby agrees to indemnify, save and hold harmless each other party hereto 
and each Loan Party for any loss, cost, damage or expense arising out of 
its inability to institute such a proceeding against such Conduit Lender 
during such period of forbearance.

(g)    If any Borrower wishes to replace the Loans or Commitments under any 
Facility with ones having different terms, it shall have the option, with 
the consent of the Administrative Agent and subject to at least three 
Business Days advance notice to the Lenders under such Facility, instead 
of prepaying the Loans or reducing or terminating the Commitments to be 
replaced, to (i) require the Lenders under such Facility to assign such 
Loans or Commitments to the Administrative Agent or its designees and (ii) 
amend the terms thereof in accordance with Section 9.08 (with such 
replacement, if applicable, being deemed to have been made pursuant to 
Section 9.08(d)). Pursuant to any such assignment, all Loans and 
Commitments to be replaced shall be purchased at par (allocated among the 
Lenders under such Facility in the same manner as would be required if such 
Loans were being optionally prepaid or such Commitments were being 
optionally reduced or terminated by any Borrower), accompanied by payment 
of any accrued interest and fees thereon and any amounts owing pursuant to 
Section 9.05(b). By receiving such purchase price, the Lenders under such 
Facility shall automatically be deemed to have assigned the Loans or 
Commitments under such Facility pursuant to the terms of the form of 
Assignment and Acceptance attached hereto as Exhibit A, and accordingly no 
other action by such Lenders shall be required in connection therewith. The 
provisions of this paragraph (g) are intended to facilitate the maintenance 
of the perfection and priority of existing security interests in the 
Collateral during any such replacement.
 
195

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(h)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no assignment may 
be made or participations sold to (x) an Ineligible Institution, (y) any 
Defaulting Lender or any of its Subsidiaries, or any person who, upon 
becoming a Lender hereunder, would constitute any of the foregoing persons 
described in this clause (h), or (z) a natural person; provided, however, 
that, notwithstanding clause (x) above, participations may be sold to 
Ineligible Institutions unless a list of Ineligible Institutions has been 
made available to all Lenders. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary 
herein, the rights of the Lenders to make assignments and grant 
participations shall be subject to the approval of any Gaming Authority, to 
the extent required by applicable Gaming Laws.

(i)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 2.08, Section 
2.11(a) or Section 2.18(c) (which provisions shall not be applicable to 
clauses (i) or (j) of this Section 9.04), any Borrower may purchase by way 
of assignment and become an Assignee with respect to Term Loans and/or 
Revolving Facility Loans (other than any such Loans held by an Affiliate 
Lender) at any time and from time to time from Lenders in accordance with 
Section 9.04(b) hereof or reduce the aggregate amount of any Revolving 
Facility Commitment of a Lender that has agreed to such reduction (
Permitted Loan Purchases); provided that (A) no Default or Event of 
Default has occurred and is continuing or would result from the Permitted 
Loan Purchase, (B) upon consummation of any such Permitted Loan Purchase, 
the Loans and/or Revolving Facility Commitments purchased or terminated 
pursuant thereto shall be deemed to be automatically and immediately 
cancelled and extinguished in accordance with Section 9.04(j), (C) to the 
extent any Borrower is making a Permitted Loan Purchase of Revolving 
Facility Loans or Revolving Facility Commitments, upon giving effect to 
such Permitted Loan Purchase, there shall be sufficient aggregate Revolving 
Facility Commitments among the Revolving Facility Lenders to apply to the 
Outstanding Amount of the L/C Obligations and Swingline Loans thereunder as 
of such date, unless such Borrower shall concurrently with the payment of 
the purchase price by such Borrower for such Revolving Facility Loans or 
the termination of such Revolving Facility Commitments, deposit cash 
collateral in an account with the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 
2.05(g) in the amount of any such excess Outstanding Amount of the L/C 
Obligations and Swingline Loans thereunder and (D) in connection with any 
such Permitted Loan Purchase (other than a termination of Revolving 
Facility Commitments), such Borrower and such Lender that is the Assignor 
shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent a Permitted Loan 
Purchase Assignment and Acceptance (and for the avoidance of doubt, shall 
not be required to execute and deliver an Assignment and Acceptance 
pursuant to Section 9.04(b)(ii)(B)) and shall otherwise comply with the 
conditions to Assignments under this Section 9.04.

(j)    Each Permitted Loan Purchase shall, for purposes of this Agreement 
(including, without limitation, Section 2.08(b)) be deemed to be an 
automatic and immediate cancellation and extinguishment of such Term Loans 
and/or Revolving Facility Loans (with a corresponding permanent reduction 
in Revolving Facility Commitments) or termination of the Revolving Facility 
Commitments, if applicable, and the Borrowers shall, upon consummation of 
any Permitted Loan Purchase, notify the Administrative Agent that the 
Register be updated to record such event as if it were a prepayment of such 
Loans (and in the case of Revolving Facility Loans or Revolving Facility 
Commitment, a permanent reduction in Revolving Facility Commitments).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 9.05.    Expenses; Indemnity.

(a)    The Borrowers agree to pay (i) all reasonable documented 
out-of-pocket expenses (including Other Taxes) incurred by the 
Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Co-Lead Arrangers in 
connection with the preparation of this Agreement and the other Loan 
Documents, or in connection with the administration of this Agreement and 
any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions hereof or 
thereof, including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of Cahill 
Gordon & Reindel LLP, counsel for the Administrative Agent, the Collateral 
Agent and the Co-Lead Arrangers, and, if necessary, the reasonable fees, 
charges and disbursements of one local counsel per jurisdiction, and (ii) 
all out-of-pocket expenses (including Other Taxes) incurred by the Agents 
or any Lender in connection with the enforcement or protection of their 
rights in connection with this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, in 
connection with the Loans made or the Letters of Credit issued hereunder, 
including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of counsel for the 
Agents and the Lenders (including the reasonable fees, charges and 
disbursements of Cahill Gordon & Reindel LLP, counsel for the Agents and 
the Co-Lead Arrangers, and, if necessary, the reasonable fees, charges and 
disbursements of one local counsel per jurisdiction and, in the event of 
any conflict of interest, such additional counsel for each of the Lenders 
retained with the consent of the Company to the extent of such conflict of 
interests).

(b)    The Borrowers agree to indemnify the Administrative Agent, the 
Agents, the Co-Lead Arrangers, each L/C Issuer, each Lender, each of their 
respective Affiliates and each of their respective directors, partners, 
officers, employees, agents, trustees and advisors (each such person being 
called an Indemnitee) against, and to hold each Indemnitee harmless from, 
any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses, 
including reasonable counsel fees, charges and disbursements (limited to 
not more than one counsel, plus, if necessary, one local counsel per 
jurisdiction) (except the allocated costs of in-house counsel), incurred by 
or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in any way connected 
with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of this Agreement or 
any other Loan Document, or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby 
or thereby, the performance by the parties hereto and thereto of their 
respective obligations thereunder or the consummation of or otherwise 
relating to the Transactions and the other transactions contemplated 
hereby, (ii) the use of the proceeds of the Loans or the use of any Letter 
of Credit or (iii) any claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding 
relating to any of the foregoing, whether or not any Indemnitee is a party 
thereto and regardless of whether such matter is initiated by a third party 
or by a Borrower or any of their subsidiaries or Affiliates; provided that 
such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent 
that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses are 
determined by a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent 
jurisdiction to have resulted from (1) the gross negligence or willful 
misconduct of such Indemnitee (for purposes this proviso only, each of the 
Administrative Agent, any Co-Lead Arranger, any L/C Issuer or any Lender 
shall be treated as several and separate Indemnitees, but each of them 
together with its respective Related Parties (other than advisors), shall 
be treated as a single Indemnitee) or (2) any material breach of any Loan 
Document by such Indemnitee or (z) arose from any claim, actions, suits, 
inquiries, litigation, investigation or proceeding that does not involve an 
act or omission of any Borrower or any of its Affiliates and is brought by 
an Indemnitee against another Indemnitee (other than any claim, actions, 
suits, inquiries, litigation, investigation or proceeding against any Agent 
or an Arranger in its capacity as such). Subject to and without
 
197

------------------------------------------------------------------------
limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, the Borrowers agree to 
indemnify each Indemnitee against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, 
any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses, 
including reasonable counsel or consultant fees, charges and disbursements 
(limited to not more than one counsel, plus, if necessary, one local 
counsel per jurisdiction) (except the allocated costs of in-house 
counsel), incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in 
any way connected with, or as a result of (A) any claim or liability 
related in any way to Environmental Laws and a Borrower or any of the 
Subsidiaries, or (B) any actual or alleged presence, Release or threatened 
Release of Hazardous Materials at, under, on, from or to any Real Property; 
provided, that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available 
to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related 
expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and 
nonappealable judgment to have resulted from (1) the gross negligence or 
willful misconduct of such Indemnitee or any of its Related Parties (other 
than advisors) or (2) any material breach of any Loan Document by such 
Indemnitee. None of the Indemnitees (or any of their respective affiliates) 
shall be responsible or liable to the Sponsors, any Borrower or any of 
their respective subsidiaries, Affiliates or stockholders or any other 
person or entity for any special, indirect, consequential or punitive 
damages, which may be alleged as a result of the Facilities or the 
Transactions. The provisions of this Section 9.05 shall remain operative 
and in full force and effect regardless of the expiration of the term of 
this Agreement, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, 
the repayment of any of the Obligations, the invalidity or unenforceability 
of any term or provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or 
any investigation made by or on behalf of the Administrative Agent, any 
Co-Lead Arranger, any L/C Issuer or any Lender. All amounts due under this 
Section 9.05 shall be payable within fifteen (15) days of written demand 
therefor accompanied by reasonable documentation with respect to any 
reimbursement, indemnification or other amount requested.

(c)    Except as expressly provided in Section 9.05(a) with respect to 
Other Taxes, which shall not be duplicative of any amounts paid pursuant to 
Section 2.17, this Section 9.05 shall not apply to Taxes, except Taxes that 
represent damages or losses resulting from a non-Tax claim.

(d)    To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrowers 
shall not assert, and hereby waive, any claim against any Indemnitee, on 
any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive 
damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in 
connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement, any other Loan Document 
or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the transactions 
contemplated hereby or thereby, any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of 
the proceeds thereof. No Indemnitee shall be liable for any damages arising 
from the use by unintended recipients of any information or other materials 
distributed by it through telecommunications, electronic or other 
information transmission systems in connection with this Agreement or the 
other Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

(e)    The agreements in this Section 9.05 shall survive the resignation of 
the Administrative Agent, any L/C Issuer, the replacement of any Lender, 
the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or 
discharge of all the other Obligations and the termination of this 
Agreement.
 
198

------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 9.06.    Right of Set-off. If an Event of Default shall have 
occurred and be continuing, each Lender and each L/C Issuer is hereby 
authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent 
permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or 
special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other 
indebtedness at any time owing by such Lender or such L/C Issuer to or for 
the credit or the account of any Borrower or any Subsidiary against any of 
and all the obligations of any Borrower now or hereafter existing under 
this Agreement or any other Loan Document held by such Lender or such L/C 
Issuer, irrespective of whether or not such Lender or such L/C Issuer shall 
have made any demand under this Agreement or such other Loan Document and 
although the obligations may be unmatured; provided, that in the event that 
any Defaulting Lender shall exercise any such right of setoff, (x) all 
amounts so set off shall be paid over immediately to the Administrative 
Agent for further application in accordance with the provisions of Section 
2.22 and, pending such payment, shall be segregated by such Defaulting 
Lender from its other funds and deemed held in trust for the benefit of the 
Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and (y) the Defaulting Lender shall 
provide promptly to the Administrative Agent a statement describing in 
reasonable detail the Obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender as to 
which it exercised such right of setoff. The rights of each Lender and each 
L/C Issuer under this Section 9.06 are in addition to other rights and 
remedies (including other rights of set-off) that such Lender or such L/C 
Issuer may have.

SECTION 9.07.    Applicable Law. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN 
DOCUMENTS (OTHER THAN AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS) SHALL 
BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF 
NEW YORK.

SECTION 9.08.    Waivers; Amendment.

(a)    No failure or delay of the Administrative Agent, any L/C Issuer or 
any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder or under any Loan 
Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial 
exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance 
of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further 
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights 
and remedies of the Administrative Agent, each L/C Issuer and the Lenders 
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not 
exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No 
waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or 
consent to any departure by any Loan Party therefrom shall in any event be 
effective unless the same shall be permitted by clause (b) below, and then 
such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and 
for the purpose for which given. No notice or demand on any Loan Party in 
any case shall entitle such person to any other or further notice or demand 
in similar or other circumstances.

(b)    Neither this Agreement nor any other Loan Document nor any provision 
hereof or thereof may be waived, amended or modified except (x) as provided 
in Section 2.21, (y) in the case of this Agreement, pursuant to an 
agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Borrowers and the 
Administrative Agent (and consented to by the Required Lenders), and (z) in 
the case of any other Loan Document, pursuant to an agreement or agreements 
in writing entered into by each party thereto and consented to by the 
Required Lenders; provided, however, that no such agreement shall:
 
199

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(i)    decrease or forgive the principal amount of, or extend the final 
maturity of, or decrease the rate of interest on, any Loan or any L/C 
Obligation, or extend the stated expiration of any Letter of Credit beyond 
the applicable Revolving Facility Maturity Date (except as provided in 
Section 2.05(b)), without the prior written consent of each Lender directly 
adversely affected thereby (which, notwithstanding the foregoing, such 
consent of such Lender directly adversely affected thereby shall be the 
only consent required hereunder to make such modification); provided, that 
any amendment to the financial covenant definitions in this Agreement shall 
not constitute a reduction in the rate of interest for purposes of this 
clause (i),

(ii)    increase or extend the Commitment of any Lender or decrease the 
Commitment Fees or L/C Participation Fees or other fees of any Lender 
without the prior written consent of such Lender (which, notwithstanding 
the foregoing, such consent of such Lender shall be the only consent 
required hereunder to make such modification); provided, that waivers or 
modifications of conditions precedent, covenants, Defaults or Events of 
Default shall not constitute an increase of the Commitments of any Lender),

(iii)    extend or waive any Term Loan Installment Date or reduce the 
amount due on any Term Loan Installment Date or extend any date on which 
payment of interest on any Loan or any L/C Obligation or any Fees is due, 
without the prior written consent of each Lender directly adversely 
affected thereby (which, notwithstanding the foregoing, such consent of 
such Lender directly adversely affected thereby shall be the only consent 
required hereunder to make such modification),

(iv)    amend the provisions of Section 5.02 of the Collateral Agreement, 
or any analogous provision of any other Security Document, in a manner that 
would by its terms alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby, 
without the prior written consent of each Lender adversely affected thereby 
(which, notwithstanding the foregoing, such consent of such Lender directly 
adversely affected thereby shall be the only consent required hereunder to 
make such modification),

(v)    amend or modify the provisions of this Section 9.08 or the 
definition of the terms Required Lenders, Majority Lenders or any other 
provision hereof specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to 
waive, amend or modify any rights hereunder or make any determination or 
grant any consent hereunder, without the prior written consent of each 
Lender adversely affected thereby (it being understood that, with the 
consent of the Required Lenders, additional extensions of credit pursuant 
to this Agreement may be included in the determination of the Required 
Lenders on substantially the same basis as the Loans and Commitments are 
included on the Closing Date),

(vi)    release all or substantially all the Collateral or release all or 
substantially all of the Subsidiary Loan Parties from their respective 
Guarantees under the Subsidiary Guarantee Agreement, unless, in the case of 
a Loan Party (other than the Company), all
 
200

------------------------------------------------------------------------
or substantially all of the Equity Interests of such Loan Party is sold or 
otherwise disposed of in a transaction permitted by this Agreement or the 
other Loan Documents or such release is otherwise pursuant to the terms of 
the Collateral Agreement or the Subsidiary Guarantee Agreement, as 
applicable, without the prior written consent of each Lender;

(vii)    effect any waiver, amendment or modification that by its terms 
adversely affects the rights in respect of payments or collateral of 
Lenders participating in any Facility differently from those of Lender 
participating in another Facility, without the consent of the Majority 
Lenders participating in the adversely affected Facility (it being agreed 
that the Required Lenders may waive, in whole or in part, any prepayment or 
Commitment reduction required by Section 2.11 so long as the application of 
any prepayment or Commitment reduction still required to be made is not 
changed);

provided, further, that no such amendment shall amend, modify or otherwise 
affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent, Swingline Lender 
or an L/C Issuer hereunder without the prior written consent of the 
Administrative Agent, Swingline Lender or such L/C Issuer acting as such at 
the effective date of such amendment, as applicable. Each Lender shall be 
bound by any waiver, amendment or modification authorized by this Section 
9.08 and any consent by any Lender pursuant to this Section 9.08 shall bind 
any successor or assignee of such Lender.

(c)    Without the consent of any Lender or L/C Issuer, the Loan Parties 
and the Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent may (in their respective 
sole discretion, or shall, to the extent required by any Loan Document) 
enter into any amendment, modification or waiver of any Loan Document, or 
enter into any new agreement or instrument, to effect the granting, 
perfection, protection, expansion or enhancement of any security interest 
in any Collateral or additional property to become Collateral for the 
benefit of the Secured Parties, or as required by local law to give effect 
to, or protect any security interest for the benefit of the Secured 
Parties, in any property or so that the security interests therein comply 
with applicable law or this Agreement or in each case to otherwise enhance 
the rights or benefits of any Lender under any Loan Document.

(d)    Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement may be amended (or 
amended and restated) with the written consent of the Required Lenders, the 
Administrative Agent and the Borrowers (a) to add one or more additional 
credit facilities to this Agreement and to permit the extensions of credit 
from time to time outstanding thereunder and the accrued interest and fees 
in respect thereof to share ratably in the benefits of this Agreement and 
the other Loan Documents with the Term Loans and the Revolving Facility 
Loans and the accrued interest and fees in respect thereof and (b) to 
include appropriately the Lenders holding such credit facilities in any 
determination of the Required Lenders.

(e)    Notwithstanding the foregoing, technical and conforming 
modifications to the Loan Documents may be made with the consent of the 
Borrowers and the Administrative Agent (but without the consent of any 
Lender) to the extent necessary (A) to integrate any Incremental Term Loan 
Commitments or Incremental Revolving Facility Commitments in a manner 
consistent with Section 2.21, including, with respect to Other Revolving 
Loans or Other Term Loans, as may be necessary to establish such 
Incremental Term Loan Commitments or
 
201

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Revolving Facility Loans, as a separate Class or tranche from the existing 
Term Loan Commitments or Incremental Revolving Facility Commitments, as 
applicable or (B) to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency.

(f)    Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that the Administrative 
Agent may take any and all action as may be necessary to ensure that all 
Term Loans established pursuant to Section 2.21 after the Closing Date that 
will be included in an existing Class of Term Loans outstanding on such 
date (an Applicable Date), when originally made, are included in each 
Borrowing of outstanding Term Loans of such Class (the Existing Class 
Loans), on a pro rata basis, and/or to ensure that, immediately after 
giving effect to such new Term Loans (the New Class Loans and, together 
with the Existing Class Loans, the Class Loans), each Lender holding 
Class Loans will be deemed to hold its Pro Rata Share of each Class Loan on 
the Applicable Date (but without changing the amount of any such Lenders 
Term Loans), and each such Lender shall be deemed to have effectuated such 
assignments as shall be required to ensure the foregoing. The Pro Rata 
Share of any Lender on the Applicable Date is the ratio of (1) the sum of 
such Lenders Existing Class Loans immediately prior to the Applicable Date 
plus the amount of New Class Loans made by such Lender on the Applicable 
Date over (2) the aggregate principal amount of all Class Loans on the 
Applicable Date.

(g)    With respect to the incurrence of any secured or unsecured 
Indebtedness (including any intercreditor agreement relating thereto), the 
Borrowers may elect (in its discretion, but shall not be obligated) to 
deliver to the Administrative Agent a certificate of a Responsible Officer 
at least three Business Days prior to the incurrence thereof (or such 
shorter time as the Administrative Agent may agree), together with either 
drafts of the material documentation relating to such Indebtedness or a 
description of such Indebtedness (including a description of the Liens 
intended to secure the same or the subordination provisions thereof, as 
applicable) in reasonably sufficient detail to be able to make the 
determinations referred to in this paragraph, which certificate shall 
either, at the Borrowers election, (x) state that the Borrowers have 
determined in good faith that such Indebtedness satisfies the requirements 
of the applicable provisions of Section 6.01 and 6.02 (taking into account 
any other applicable provisions of this Section 9.08), in which case such 
certificate shall be conclusive evidence thereof, or (y) request the 
Administrative Agent to confirm, based on the information set forth in such 
certificate and any other information reasonably requested by the 
Administrative Agent, that such Indebtedness satisfies such requirements, 
in which case the Administrative Agent may determine whether, in its 
reasonable judgment, such requirements have been satisfied (in which case 
it shall deliver to the Borrowers a written confirmation of the same), with 
any such determination of the Administrative Agent to be conclusive 
evidence thereof, and the Lenders hereby authorize the Administrative Agent 
to make such determinations.

SECTION 9.09.    Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding anything herein 
to the contrary, if at any time the applicable interest rate, together with 
all fees and charges that are treated as interest under applicable law 
(collectively, the Charges), as provided for herein or in any other 
document executed in connection herewith, or otherwise contracted for, 
charged, received, taken or reserved by any Lender or any L/C Issuer, shall 
exceed the maximum lawful rate (the Maximum Rate) that may be contracted 
for, charged, taken, received or reserved by such Lender in accordance with 
applicable law, the rate of interest payable hereunder, together
 
202

------------------------------------------------------------------------
with all Charges payable to such Lender or such L/C Issuer, shall be 
limited to the Maximum Rate; provided, that such excess amount shall be 
paid to such Lender or such L/C Issuer on subsequent payment dates to the 
extent not exceeding the legal limitation.

SECTION 9.10.    Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the other Loan Documents 
and the agreements regarding certain Fees referred to herein constitute the 
entire contract between the parties relative to the subject matter hereof. 
Any previous agreement among or representations from the parties or their 
Affiliates with respect to the subject matter hereof is superseded by this 
Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Nothing in this Agreement or in the 
other Loan Documents, expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any 
party other than the parties hereto and thereto any rights, remedies, 
obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement or the 
other Loan Documents.

SECTION 9.11.    WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO 
THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A 
TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING 
OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE OTHER LOAN 
DOCUMENTS. EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR 
ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT 
SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE 
FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO 
HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN 
DOCUMENTS, AS APPLICABLE, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND 
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.11.

SECTION 9.12.    Severability. In the event any one or more of the 
provisions contained in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document should 
be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the validity, 
legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein 
and therein shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. The 
parties shall endeavor in good-faith negotiations to replace the invalid, 
illegal or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic 
effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the invalid, illegal 
or unenforceable provisions.

SECTION 9.13.    Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or 
more counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original but all of 
which, when taken together, shall constitute but one contract, and shall 
become effective as provided in Section 9.03. Delivery of an executed 
counterpart to this Agreement by facsimile transmission (or other 
electronic transmission pursuant to procedures approved by the 
Administrative Agent) shall be as effective as delivery of a manually 
signed original.

SECTION 9.14.    Headings. Article and Section headings and the Table of 
Contents used herein are for convenience of reference only, are not part of 
this Agreement and are not to affect the construction of, or to be taken 
into consideration in interpreting, this Agreement.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 9.15.    Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process.

(a)    Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally 
submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of any 
New York State court or federal court of the United States of America 
sitting in New York City, and any appellate court from any thereof 
(collectively, New York Courts), in any action or proceeding arising out 
of or relating to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, or for 
recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties hereto 
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of 
any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York 
State or, to the extent permitted by law, in such federal court. Each of 
the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or 
proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions 
by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in 
this Agreement shall affect any right that any party may otherwise have to 
bring any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any of the 
other Loan Documents in the courts of any jurisdiction, except that each of 
the Loan Parties agrees that (a) it will not bring any such action or 
proceeding in any court other than New York Courts (it being acknowledged 
and agreed by the parties hereto that any other forum would be inconvenient 
and inappropriate in view of the fact that more of the Lenders who would be 
affected by any such action or proceeding have contacts with the State of 
New York than any other jurisdiction), and (b) in any such action or 
proceeding brought against any Loan Party in any other court, it will not 
assert any cross-claim, counterclaim or setoff, or seek any other 
affirmative relief, except to the extent that the failure to assert the 
same will preclude such Loan Party from asserting or seeking the same in 
the New York Courts.

(b)    Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally 
waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any 
objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any 
suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or 
the other Loan Documents in any New York State or federal court. Each of 
the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent 
permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance 
of such action or proceeding in any such court.

(c)    Each party hereto irrevocably consents to service of process in the 
manner provided for notices in Section 9.01. Nothing in this Agreement will 
affect the right of any party hereto to serve process in any other manner 
permitted by applicable law.

SECTION 9.16.    Confidentiality. Each of the Lenders, each L/C Issuer and 
each of the Agents agrees that it shall maintain in confidence any 
information relating to the Company, any Parent Entity, any Borrower and 
any Subsidiary furnished to it by or on behalf of the Company, any Parent 
Entity, any Borrower or any Subsidiary (other than information that (a) has 
become available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by 
such party in breach of this Section 9.16, (b) has been independently 
developed by such Lender, such L/C Issuer or such Agent without violating 
this Section 9.16 or (c) was or becomes available to such Lender, such L/C 
Issuer or such Agent from a third party which, to such persons knowledge, 
had not breached an obligation of confidentiality to the Company, any 
Parent Entity or any Loan Party) and shall not reveal the same other than 
to its affiliates, directors, trustees, officers, employees and advisors 
with a need to know or to any person that approves or administers the Loans 
on behalf of such Lender (so long as each such person shall have been 
instructed to keep the same
 
204

------------------------------------------------------------------------
confidential), except: (A) to the extent necessary to comply with law or 
any legal process or the requirements of any Governmental Authority, the 
National Association of Insurance Commissioners or of any securities 
exchange on which securities of the disclosing party or any Affiliate of 
the disclosing party are listed or traded, (B) as part of normal reporting 
or review procedures to, or examinations by, Governmental Authorities or 
self-regulatory authorities, including the National Association of 
Insurance Commissioners or the National Association of Securities Dealers, 
Inc., (C) in order to enforce its rights under any Loan Document in a legal 
proceeding, (D) to any pledgee under Section 9.04(d) or any other 
prospective assignee of, or prospective Participant in, any of its rights 
under this Agreement (so long as such person shall have been instructed to 
keep the same confidential in accordance with this Section 9.16 or terms 
substantially similar to this Section) and (E) to any direct or indirect 
contractual counterparty in Swap Agreements or such contractual 
counterpartys professional advisor (so long as such contractual 
counterparty or professional advisor to such contractual counterparty 
agrees to be bound by the provisions of this Section 9.16 or terms 
substantially similar to this Section).

SECTION 9.17.    Platform; Borrower Materials. The Borrowers hereby 
acknowledge that (a) the Administrative Agent and/or the Co-Lead Arrangers 
will make available to the Lenders and the L/C Issuer materials and/or 
information provided by or on behalf of the Borrowers hereunder 
(collectively, Borrower Materials) by posting the Borrower Materials on 
IntraLinks or another similar electronic system (the Platform), and (b) 
certain of the Lenders may be public-side Lenders (i.e., Lenders that do 
not wish to receive material non-public information with respect to the 
Borrowers or their securities) (each, a Public Lender). The Borrowers 
hereby agree that it will use commercially reasonable efforts to identify 
that portion of the Borrower Materials that may be distributed to the 
Public Lenders and that (i) all such Borrower Materials shall be clearly 
and conspicuously marked PUBLIC which, at a minimum, shall mean that the 
word PUBLIC shall appear prominently on the first page thereof, (ii) by 
marking Borrower Materials PUBLIC, the Borrowers shall be deemed to have 
authorized the Administrative Agent, the Co-Lead Arrangers, the L/C Issuer 
and the Lenders to treat such Borrower Materials as either publicly 
available information or not material information (although it may be 
sensitive and proprietary) with respect to the Borrowers or their 
securities for purposes of United States Federal and state securities laws 
(provided, however, that such Borrower Materials shall be treated as set 
forth in Section 9.16, to the extent such Borrower Materials constitute 
information subject to the terms thereof), (iii) all Borrower Materials 
marked PUBLIC are permitted to be made available through a portion of the 
Platform designated Public Investor; and (iv) the Administrative Agent 
and the Co-Lead Arrangers shall be entitled to treat any Borrower Materials 
that are not marked PUBLIC as being suitable only for posting on a 
portion of the Platform not designated Public Investor.

THE PLATFORM IS PROVIDED AS IS AND AS AVAILABLE. THE AGENT PARTIES (AS 
DEFINED BELOW) DO NOT WARRANT THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF THE BORROWER 
MATERIALS OR THE ADEQUACY OF THE PLATFORM, AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM LIABILITY 
FOR ERRORS IN OR OMISSIONS FROM THE BORROWER MATERIALS. NO WARRANTY OF ANY 
KIND, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY OF 
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OF 
THIRD PARTY RIGHTS OR FREEDOM FROM VIRUSES OR OTHER CODE DEFECTS, IS MADE 
BY ANY AGENT PARTY IN CONNECTION WITH THE
 
205

------------------------------------------------------------------------
BORROWER MATERIALS OR THE PLATFORM. In no event shall the Administrative 
Agent or any of its Related Parties (collectively, the Agent Parties) 
have any liability to any Borrower, any Lender, the L/C Issuer or any other 
Person for losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses of any kind 
(whether in tort, contract or otherwise) arising out of any Borrowers or 
the Administrative Agents transmission of Borrower Materials through the 
Internet, except to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, 
liabilities or expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction 
by a final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross 
negligence or willful misconduct of such Agent Party; provided, however, 
that in no event shall any Agent Party have any liability to any Borrower, 
any Lender, the L/C Issuer or any other person for indirect, special, 
incidental, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or 
actual damages).

SECTION 9.18.    Release of Liens, Guarantees and Pledges.

(a)    The Lenders, the L/C Issuer and other Secured Parties hereby 
irrevocably agree that the Liens granted to the Collateral Agent by the 
Loan Parties on any Collateral shall be automatically released: (i) in full 
upon the occurrence of the Termination Date as set forth in Section 9.18(d) 
below; (ii) upon the disposition of such Collateral by any Loan Party to a 
person that is not (and is not required to become) a Loan Party in a 
transaction not prohibited by this Agreement (and the Collateral Agent may 
rely conclusively on a certificate to that effect provided to it by any 
Loan Party upon its reasonable request without further inquiry), (iii) to 
the extent that such Collateral comprises property leased to a Loan Party 
by a person that is not a Loan Party, upon termination or expiration of 
such lease (and the Collateral Agent may rely conclusively on a certificate 
to that effect provided to it by any Loan Party upon its reasonable request 
without further inquiry), (iv) if the release of such Lien is approved, 
authorized or ratified in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other 
percentage of the Lenders whose consent may be required in accordance with 
Section 9.08), (v) to the extent that the property constituting such 
Collateral is owned by any Guarantor, upon the release of such Guarantor 
from its obligations under the Guarantee in accordance with the Subsidiary 
Guarantee Agreement or clause (b) below (and the Collateral Agent may rely 
conclusively on a certificate to that effect provided to it by any Loan 
Party upon its reasonable request without further inquiry), (vi) as 
provided in Section 5.11 (and the Collateral Agent may rely conclusively on 
a certificate to that effect provided to it by any Loan Party upon its 
reasonable request without further inquiry), and (vii) as required by the 
Collateral Agent to effect any Disposition of Collateral in connection with 
any exercise of remedies of the Collateral Agent pursuant to the Security 
Documents. Any such release shall not in any manner discharge, affect, or 
impair the Obligations or any Liens (other than those being released) upon 
(or obligations (other than those being released) of the Loan Parties in 
respect of) all interests retained by the Loan Parties, including the 
proceeds of any Disposition, all of which shall continue to constitute part 
of the Collateral except to the extent otherwise released in accordance 
with the provisions of the Loan Documents.

(b)    In addition, the Lenders, the L/C Issuer and other Secured Parties 
hereby irrevocably agree that the Subsidiary Loan Parties shall be released 
from the Guarantees upon consummation of any transaction not prohibited 
hereunder resulting in such Subsidiary ceasing to constitute a Subsidiary 
Loan Party or otherwise becoming an Excluded Subsidiary (and the Collateral 
Agent may rely conclusively on a certificate to that effect provided to it 
by any Loan Party upon its reasonable request without further inquiry).
 
206

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(c)    The Lenders, the L/C Issuer and other Secured Parties hereby 
authorize the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent, as applicable, 
to execute and deliver any instruments, documents, and agreements necessary 
or desirable to evidence and confirm the release of any Subsidiary Loan 
Party or Collateral pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 
9.18, all without the further consent or joinder of any Lender. Upon 
release pursuant to this Section 9.18, any representation, warranty or 
covenant contained in any Loan Document relating to any such Collateral or 
Guarantor shall no longer be deemed to be made. In connection with any 
release hereunder, the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent shall 
promptly (and the Secured Parties hereby authorize the Administrative Agent 
and the Collateral Agent to) take such action and execute any such 
documents as may be reasonably requested by any Borrowers and at such 
Borrowers expense in connection with the release of any Liens created by 
any Loan Document in respect of such Subsidiary, property or asset; 
provided, that the Administrative Agent shall have received a certificate 
of a Responsible Officer of such Borrower containing such certifications as 
the Administrative Agent shall reasonably request.

(d)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or any 
other Loan Document, on the Termination Date, upon request of any Borrower, 
the Administrative Agent and/or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, shall 
(without notice to, or vote or consent of, any Secured Party) take such 
actions as shall be required to release its security interest in all 
Collateral, and to release all obligations under any Loan Document, whether 
or not on the date of such release there may be any (i) obligations in 
respect of any Secured Hedge Agreements or any Secured Cash Management 
Agreements and (ii) any contingent indemnification obligations or expense 
reimburse claims not then due; provided, that the Administrative Agent 
shall have received a certificate of a Responsible Officer of such Borrower 
containing such certifications as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably 
request. Any such release of obligations shall be deemed subject to the 
provision that such obligations shall be reinstated if after such release 
any portion of any payment in respect of the obligations guaranteed thereby 
shall be rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned upon the 
insolvency, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or reorganization of the 
Company or any Guarantor, or upon or as a result of the appointment of a 
receiver, intervenor or conservator of, or trustee or similar officer for, 
the Company or any Guarantor or any substantial part of its property, or 
otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made. The Borrowers 
agree to pay all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred 
by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent (and their respective 
representatives) in connection with taking such actions to release security 
interest in all Collateral and all obligations under the Loan Documents as 
contemplated by this Section 9.18(d).

(e)    Obligations of any Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries under any 
Secured Cash Management Agreement or Secured Swap Agreement (after giving 
effect to all netting arrangements relating to such Secured Swap 
Agreements) shall be secured and guaranteed pursuant to the Security 
Documents only to the extent that, and for so long as, the other 
Obligations are so secured and guaranteed. No person shall have any voting 
rights under any Loan Document solely as a result of the existence of 
obligations owed to it under any such Secured Swap Agreement or Secured 
Cash Management Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, no release of 
Collateral or Guarantors effected in the manner permitted by this Agreement 
shall require the consent of any holder of obligations under Secured Swap 
Agreements or any Secured Cash Management Agreements.
 
207

------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 9.19.    Judgment Currency. If, for the purposes of obtaining 
judgment in any court, it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder or 
any other Loan Document in one currency into another currency, the rate of 
exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking 
procedures the Administrative Agent could purchase the first currency with 
such other currency on the Business Day preceding that on which final 
judgment is given. The obligation of the Borrowers in respect of any such 
sum due from it to the Administrative Agent or the Lenders hereunder or 
under the other Loan Documents shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a 
currency (the Judgment Currency) other than that in which such sum is 
denominated in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement 
(the Agreement Currency), be discharged only to the extent that on the 
Business Day following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any sum 
adjudged to be so due in the Judgment Currency, the Administrative Agent 
may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase the Agreement 
Currency with the Judgment Currency. If the amount of the Agreement 
Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to the 
Administrative Agent from any Borrower in the Agreement Currency, such 
Borrower agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such 
judgment, to indemnify the Administrative Agent or the person to whom such 
obligation was owing against such loss. If the amount of the Agreement 
Currency so purchased is greater than the sum originally due to the 
Administrative Agent in such currency, the Administrative Agent agrees to 
return the amount of any excess to such Borrower (or to any other person 
who may be entitled thereto under applicable law).

SECTION 9.20.    USA PATRIOT Act Notice. Each Lender that is subject to the 
USA PATRIOT Act and the Administrative Agent (for itself and not on behalf 
of any Lender) hereby notifies the Borrowers that pursuant to the 
requirements of the USA Patriot Act, it is required to obtain, verify and 
record information that identifies each Loan Party, which information 
includes the name and address of each Loan Party and other information that 
will allow such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, to 
identify each Loan Party in accordance with the USA PATRIOT Act.

SECTION 9.21.    No Advisory or Fiduciary Responsibility. In connection 
with all aspects of each transaction contemplated hereby, the Borrowers 
acknowledge and agree that: (i) the credit facilities provided for 
hereunder and any related arranging or other services in connection 
therewith (including in connection with any amendment, waiver or other 
modification hereof or of any other Loan Document) are an arms-length 
commercial transaction between the Loan Parties and their respective 
Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Agents, the Co-Lead Arrangers and the 
Lenders, on the other hand, and the Loan Parties are capable of evaluating 
and understanding and understand and accept the terms, risks and conditions 
of the transactions contemplated hereby and by the other Loan Documents 
(including any amendment, waiver or other modification hereof or thereof); 
(ii) in connection with the process leading to such transaction, each 
Agent, each Co-Lead Arranger and each Lender is and has been acting solely 
as a principal and is not the financial advisor, agent or fiduciary, for 
any Loan Party or any of their respective Affiliates, stockholders, 
creditors or employees or any other person; (iii) none of the Agents, any 
Co-Lead Arranger or any Lender has assumed or will assume an advisory, 
agency or fiduciary responsibility in favor of any Loan Party with respect 
to any of the transactions contemplated hereby or the process leading 
thereto, including with respect to any amendment, waiver or other 
modification hereof or of any other Loan Document (irrespective of whether 
any Agent, any Co-Lead Arranger or any Lender has advised or is currently 
advising the
 
208

------------------------------------------------------------------------
any Loan Party or their respective Affiliates on other matters) and none of 
the Agents, any Co-Lead Arranger or any Lender has any obligation to any of 
the Loan Parties or their respective Affiliates with respect to the 
transactions contemplated hereby except those obligations expressly set 
forth herein and in the other Loan Documents; (iv) the Agents, the Co-Lead 
Arrangers, the Lenders and their respective Affiliates may be engaged in a 
broad range of transactions that involve interests that differ from those 
of the Loan Parties and their respective Affiliates, and none of the 
Agents, any Co-Lead Arranger or any Lender has any obligation to disclose 
any of such interests by virtue of any advisory, agency or fiduciary 
relationship; and (v) the Agents, the Co-Lead Arrangers and the Lenders 
have not provided and will not provide any legal, accounting, regulatory or 
tax advice with respect to any of the transactions contemplated hereby 
(including any amendment, waiver or other modification hereof or of any 
other Loan Document) and the Loan Parties have consulted their own legal, 
accounting, regulatory and tax advisors to the extent they deemed 
appropriate. Each Borrower hereby waives and releases, to the fullest 
extent permitted by law, any claims that it may have against the Agents, 
the Co-Lead Arrangers and the Lenders with respect to any breach or alleged 
breach of agency or fiduciary duty.

SECTION 9.22.    Application of Gaming Laws.

(a)    This Agreement and the other Loan Documents are subject to Gaming 
Laws and Liquor Laws. Without limiting the foregoing and notwithstanding 
anything herein or in any other Loan Document to the contrary, the Lenders, 
Agents and Secured Parties acknowledge that (i) they are subject to the 
jurisdiction of the Gaming Authorities and Liquor Authorities, in their 
discretion, for licensing, qualification or findings of suitability or to 
file or provide other information, and (ii)(x) the consummation of the 
Post-Closing Restructuring Transaction and (y) all rights, remedies and 
powers in or under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, including 
with respect to the Collateral (including the pledge and delivery of the 
Pledged Collateral), the Mortgaged Properties and the ownership and 
operation of facilities are, in each case, subject to the jurisdiction of 
the Gaming Authorities and Liquor Authorities, and may be exercised only to 
the extent that the exercise thereof does not violate any applicable 
provisions of the Gaming Laws and Liquor Laws and only to the extent that 
required approvals (including prior approvals) are obtained from the 
relevant Gaming Authorities and Liquor Authorities.

(b)    Lenders, Agents and Secured Parties agree to cooperate with all 
Gaming Authorities and Liquor Authorities in connection with the provision 
in a timely manner of such documents or other information as may be 
requested by such Gaming Authorities and Liquor Authorities relating to the 
Loan or Loan Documents.

(c)    Lenders acknowledge and agree that if any Borrower receives a notice 
from any applicable Gaming Authority that any Lender is a disqualified 
holder (and such Lender is notified by any Borrower in writing of such 
disqualification), such Borrower shall, following any available appeal of 
such determination by such Gaming Authority (unless the rules of the 
applicable Gaming Authority do not permit such Lender to retain its Loans 
or Commitments pending appeal of such determination), have the right to (i) 
cause such disqualified holder to transfer and assign, without recourse all 
of its interests, rights and obligations in its Loans and Commitments or 
(ii) in the event that (A) such Borrower is unable to assign such Loan 
after using its best efforts to cause such an assignment and (B) no Default 
or Event of Default has
 
209

------------------------------------------------------------------------
occurred and is continuing, prepay such disqualified holders Loan. Notice 
to such disqualified holder shall be given ten days prior to the required 
date of assignment or prepayment, as the case may be, and shall be 
accompanied by evidence demonstrating that such transfer or prepayment is 
required pursuant to Gaming Laws. If reasonably requested by any 
disqualified holder, such Borrower will use commercially reasonable efforts 
to cooperate with any such holder that is seeking to appeal such 
determination and to afford such holder an opportunity to participate in 
any proceedings relating thereto. Notwithstanding anything herein to the 
contrary, any prepayment of a Loan shall be at a price that, unless 
otherwise directed by a Gaming Authority, shall be equal to the sum of the 
principal amount of such Loan and interest to the date such Lender or 
holder became a disqualified holder (plus any fees and other amounts 
accrued for the account of such disqualified holder to the date such Lender 
or holder became a disqualified holder).

(d)    If during the existence of an Event of Default hereunder or any of 
the other Loan Documents it shall become necessary or, in the opinion of 
the Administrative Agent, advisable for an agent, supervisor, receiver or 
other representative of the Lenders to become licensed or found qualified 
under any Gaming Law as a condition to receiving the benefit of any 
Collateral encumbered by the Loan Documents or to otherwise enforce the 
rights of the Agents, Secured Parties and the Lenders under the Loan 
Documents, the Borrowers hereby agree to consent to the application for 
such license or qualification and to execute such further documents as may 
be required in connection with the evidencing of such consent.

SECTION 9.23.    Affiliate Lenders.

(a)    Each Lender who is an Affiliate of the Borrowers (an Affiliate 
Lender), in connection with any (i) consent (or decision not to consent) 
to any amendment, modification, waiver, consent or other action with 
respect to any of the terms of any Loan Document, (ii) other action on any 
matter related to any Loan Document or (iii) direction to the 
Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent or any Lender to undertake any 
action (or refrain from taking any action) with respect to or under any 
Loan Document, agrees that, except with respect to any amendment, 
modification, waiver, consent or other action (1) described in clauses (i), 
(ii) or (iii) of the first proviso of Section 9.08(b) or (2) that adversely 
affects such Affiliate Lender (in its capacity as a Lender) in a 
disproportionately adverse manner as compared to other Lenders, such 
Affiliate Lender shall be deemed to have voted its interest as a Lender 
without discretion in such proportion as the allocation of voting with 
respect to such matter by Lenders who are not Affiliate Lenders. Each 
Affiliate Lender hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent (such 
appointment being coupled with an interest) as such Affiliate Lenders 
attorney-in-fact, with full authority in the place and stead of such 
Affiliate Lender and in the name of such Affiliate Lender, from time to 
time in the Administrative Agents discretion to take any action and to 
execute any instrument that the Administrative Agent may deem reasonably 
necessary to carry out the provisions of this clause (a).

(b)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no 
Affiliate Lender shall have any right to (i) attend (including by 
telephone) any meeting or discussions (or portion thereof) among the 
Administrative Agent or any Lender to which representatives of the 
Borrowers are not then present, (ii) receive any information or material 
prepared by Administrative Agent or any Lender or any communication by or 
among Administrative Agent
 
210

------------------------------------------------------------------------
and/or one or more Lenders, except to the extent such information or 
materials have been made available to the Borrowers or their 
representatives, or (iii) make or bring (or participate in, other than as a 
passive participant in or recipient of its pro rata benefits of) any claim, 
in its capacity as a Lender, against Administrative Agent, the Collateral 
Agent or any other Lender with respect to any duties or obligations or 
alleged duties or obligations of such Agent or any other such Lender under 
the Loan Documents.

SECTION 9.24.    Acknowledgement and Consent to Bail-In of EEA Financial 
Institutions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Loan Document 
or in any other agreement, arrangement or understanding among any such 
parties, each party hereto acknowledges that any liability of any EEA 
Financial Institution arising under any Loan Document, to the extent such 
liability is unsecured, may be subject to the write-down and conversion 
powers of an EEA Resolution Authority and agrees and consents to, and 
acknowledges and agrees to be bound by:

(a)     the application of any Write-Down and Conversion Powers by an EEA 
Resolution Authority to any such liabilities arising hereunder which may be 
payable to it by any party hereto that is an EEA Financial Institution; and

(b)     the effects of any Bail-In Action on any such liability, including, 
if applicable:

(i)     a reduction in full or in part or cancellation of any such 
liability;

(ii)     a conversion of all, or a portion of, such liability into shares 
or other instruments of ownership in such EEA Financial Institution, its 
parent undertaking, or a bridge institution that may be issued to it or 
otherwise conferred on it, and that such shares or other instruments of 
ownership will be accepted by it in lieu of any rights with respect to any 
such liability under this Agreement or any other Loan Document; or

(iii)     the variation of the terms of such liability in connection with 
the exercise of the write-down and conversion powers of any EEA Resolution 
Authority.
