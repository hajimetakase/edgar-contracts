TRANSFERRED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND TECHNOLOGY AND ASSUMPTION OF 
LIABILITIES

SECTION 2.01. Assignment of Intellectual Property Rights. (a) Subject to 
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, effective as of the 
Distribution, Xerox hereby sells, assigns, transfers and conveys, and 
agrees to cause the members of its Group to hereby, sell, assign, transfer 
and convey, to Conduent all of the right, title and interest of the Xerox 
Group in, to and under all Transferred Intellectual Property Rights, 
subject to the licenses granted to Xerox and the members of its Group in 
Article IV below and all other licenses granted or that a Party has an 
obligation to grant under any such Intellectual Property Rights existing 
and in full force and effect as of immediately prior to the Distribution 
(subject to the terms and conditions contained in each such license). 
Without limitation to the generality of the foregoing, with respect to any 
United States intent-to-use trademark applications included in the 
Transferred Intellectual Property Rights (ITU Applications), the 
assignment granted hereunder accompanies the transfer of the business or 
portion of the business of the assignor to which such ITU Applications 
pertain, and that business is ongoing and existing, or the transfer of such 
ITU Applications shall not be effective until the expiration of any period 
during which the assignment thereof would impair, under applicable federal 
law, the registrability of such ITU Applications or the validity or 
enforceability of registrations issuing from such ITU Applications. The 
assignment of Transferred Intellectual Property Rights herein includes all 
of Xeroxs and its Group members right, title and interest in and to any 
and all proceeds, causes of action and rights of recovery against third 
parties for past and future infringement, misappropriation or other 
violation or impairment of any of the Transferred Intellectual Property 
Rights. The Parties shall, and shall cause their respective Group members 
(as applicable) to, execute intellectual property assignments in a form 
substantially similar to that attached as Schedule A1 (the Patent 
Assignment Agreement), Schedule A2 (the Trademark Assignment Agreement), 
and Schedule A3 (the Copyright Assignment), as well as such additional 
case specific assignments as deemed appropriate to carry out the intent of 
the Parties, as applicable (collectively, the Intellectual Property 
Assignment Agreements), for recordation with the appropriate Governmental 
Authority.

(b) Recording Change of Ownership of the Transferred Intellectual Property 
Rights. Conduent shall have the sole responsibility, at its sole cost and 
expense, to file the Intellectual Property Assignment Agreements and any 
other forms or documents as required to record the assignment of any 
Transferred Intellectual Property Rights from Xerox and the members of its 
Group to Conduent; provided, however, that, upon written request, Xerox 
shall provide reasonable assistance to Conduent to record the assignment, 
at Conduents sole cost and expense.

(c) Responsibility for Transferred Patents. Xerox shall pay all fees 
incurred and respond to all office actions due with respect to the 
Transferred Patents up to and including the Distribution Date. Conduent 
shall, in its sole discretion, pay all fees incurred and respond to all 
office actions due with respect to the Transferred Patents after the 
Distribution Date. At or prior to the Distribution, Xerox shall provide 
Conduent with a listing, in a form to be agreed upon by the Parties, of: 
(i) all known responses to office
 
14

------------------------------------------------------------------------
actions and fees due with respect to the Transferred Patents in all 
relevant jurisdictions with due dates within 120 days of the Distribution 
Date; and (ii) a copy of all hard-copy or digitally stored Docket Files 
relating to the Transferred Patents, unless such files are in the 
possession of Xeroxs outside counsel or agents, in which case Xerox shall 
send written instructions to its counsel and agents directing them to act 
in accordance with Conduents instructions with respect to such files.

(d) Purchase of Certain Transferred Patents. The Parties hereby expressly 
agree that, as consideration for the sale, assignment, transfer and 
conveyance of the Specified Purchase Patents, Specified Purchase IDs and 
Specified Purchase Projects included in the Transferred Intellectual 
Property Rights pursuant to this Section 2.01, Conduent (or any applicable 
member of its Group) shall pay to Xerox (or any applicable member of its 
Group) an amount equal to the Specified Purchase Price, at such time and by 
such method as shall reasonably be agreed by the Parties.

SECTION 2.02. Common Infrastructure Copyrights. (a) Common Infrastructure 
Copyrights shall be co-owned by Xerox and Conduent. Accordingly, each 
Party, or the applicable member of its Group, transfers and assigns (as 
assignor) to the other Party (as assignee), effective as of the 
Distribution Date, an undivided one-half part of the whole right, title, 
and interest in Common Infrastructure Copyrights owned by the assignor as 
of the Distribution Date, such undivided one-half part to be held and 
enjoyed by the assignee, as fully and entirely as the same would have been 
held and enjoyed by the assignor if this transfer had not been made. Upon a 
Partys written request, the other Party (and, to the extent necessary, the 
members of its Group) shall execute documents confirming the assignment of 
such co-ownership interest to the requesting Party. Subject to Article VI, 
each co-owner shall be free to exploit the Common Infrastructure Copyrights 
without further consent and without accounting to the other co-owner. Each 
Party shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other Party, each other 
member of the other Partys Group, and each of their respective former and 
current directors, officers and employees, and each of the heirs, 
executors, successors and assigns of any of the foregoing from and against 
any and all Liabilities arising out of or resulting from the indemnifying 
Partys or any member of its Groups exploitation of the Common 
Infrastructure Copyrights following the Distribution.

(b) The Parties acknowledge that some of the materials associated with 
Common Infrastructure Copyrights (e.g., documents, PowerPoint slides, photo 
libraries, etc.) may also contain third party-owned copyrighted material (
3POCM) such as fonts, images and graphics, which are licensed to a Party. 
This provision therefore does not extend to such 3POCM, and each Party is 
solely responsible for obtaining its own licenses to the 3POCM. Each Party 
shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other Party, each other 
member of the other Partys Group, and each of their respective former and 
current directors, officers and employees, and each of the heirs, 
executors, successors and assigns of any of the foregoing from and against 
any and all claims by third parties arising out of or relating to the 
indemnifying Partys or any member of its Groups use or exploitation of 
3POCM following the Distribution.
 
15

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, and except as expressly permitted by the 
TLA, the use of any Common Infrastructure Copyrights by or for one Party, 
and any works related to, or based upon, any of the Common Infrastructure 
Copyrights, may not contain any references to the other Party or any member 
of its Group (or any of its or their marks, names, trade dress, logos or 
other source or business identifiers), the other Partys or any member of 
its Groups publications, personnel (including senior management) or 
management structures, or any other indication (other than the verbatim or 
paraphrased reproduction of the content) that such works are based upon any 
Common Infrastructure Copyrights that originated with the other Party or 
any member of its Group.

(d) Neither Xerox nor Conduent shall have any obligation to the other to 
(i) notify of any changes or proposed changes to any of the Common 
Infrastructure Copyrights, (ii) include the other in any consideration of 
proposed changes to any of the Common Infrastructure Copyrights, (iii) 
provide draft changes of any of the Common Infrastructure Copyrights to the 
other for review or comment or (iv) provide the other with any updated 
materials relating to any of the Common Infrastructure Copyrights.

SECTION 2.03. Common Infrastructure Trade Secrets. Common Infrastructure 
Trade Secrets shall be co-owned by Xerox and Conduent. Accordingly, each 
Party, or the applicable member of its Group, transfers and assigns (as 
assignor) to the other Party (as assignee), effective as of the 
Distribution Date, an undivided one-half part of the whole right, title, 
and interest in Common Infrastructure Trade Secrets owned by the assignor 
as of the Distribution Date, such undivided one-half part to be held and 
enjoyed by the assignee, as fully and entirely as the same would have been 
held and enjoyed by the assignor if this transfer had not been made. Upon a 
Partys written request, the other Party (and, to the extent necessary, the 
members of its Group) shall execute documents confirming the assignment of 
such co-ownership interest to the requesting Party. Subject to Article VI, 
below, each co-owner shall be free to exploit the Common Infrastructure 
Trade Secrets without further consent and without accounting to the other 
co-owner. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither of the joint owners 
(Conduent, Xerox) shall make a Common Infrastructure Trade Secret public or 
otherwise destroy or impair the Trade Secret status of a Common 
Infrastructure Trade Secret without the advance, written consent of the 
other joint owner. Each Party shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the 
other Party, each other member of the other Partys Group, and each of 
their respective former and current directors, officers and employees, and 
each of the heirs, executors, successors and assigns of any of the 
foregoing from and against any and all Liabilities arising out of or 
resulting from the indemnifying Partys or any member of its Groups 
exploitation of the Common Infrastructure Trade Secrets following the 
Distribution.

SECTION 2.04. Acceptance and Assumption of Transferred Intellectual 
Property Liabilities. Subject to the terms and conditions of this 
Agreement, effective as of the Distribution, Conduent shall, and shall 
cause the applicable members of its Group to, accept, assume and agree 
faithfully to perform, discharge and fulfill the Transferred Intellectual 
Property Liabilities in accordance with their respective terms. Conduent 
shall, and shall cause the applicable members of its Group to, be 
responsible for all Transferred Intellectual Property Liabilities, 
regardless of when or where such Transferred
 
16

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Intellectual Property Liabilities arose or arise, or whether the facts on 
which they are based occurred prior to, at or subsequent to the 
Distribution, regardless of where or against whom such Transferred 
Intellectual Property Liabilities are asserted or determined or whether 
asserted or determined prior to the date of this Agreement. Notwithstanding 
the foregoing, for the avoidance of doubt, the scope of Conduents 
obligations with respect to any Common Infrastructure Liabilities shall be 
co-extensive with, and not greater than, the scope of Xeroxs obligations 
with respect to Common Infrastructure Liabilities.

SECTION 2.05. Acceptance and Assumption by Xerox of Common Infrastructure 
Liabilities. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, 
effective as of the Distribution, Xerox shall, and shall cause the 
applicable members of its Group to, accept, assume and agree faithfully to 
perform, discharge and fulfill the Xerox Common Infrastructure Liability 
Percentage of any Common Infrastructure Liabilities in accordance with 
their respective terms. Xerox shall, and shall cause the applicable members 
of its Group to, be responsible for the Xerox Common Infrastructure 
Liability Percentage of any Common Infrastructure Liabilities, regardless 
of where such Common Infrastructure Liabilities arose, or whether such 
Common Infrastructure Liabilities are asserted or determined prior to or 
after the date of this Agreement.

SECTION 2.06. Delayed Transfers; Wrong Pockets. (a) In the event that it is 
discovered after the Distribution that there was an omission of (i) the 
transfer or conveyance by Xerox (or a member of the Xerox Group) or the 
acceptance or assumption by Conduent (or a member of the Conduent Group) of 
any Transferred Intellectual Property Right, Transferred Intellectual 
Property Liability, Common Infrastructure Right or Common Infrastructure 
Liability, as the case may be, or (ii) the transfer or conveyance by one 
Party (or any other member of its Group) to, or the acceptance or 
assumption by, the other Party (or any other member of its Group) of any 
Intellectual Property Right, Intellectual Property Liability, Common 
Infrastructure Right or Common Infrastructure Liability, as the case may 
be, that, had the Parties given specific consideration to such Intellectual 
Property Right, Intellectual Property Liability, Common Infrastructure 
Right or Common Infrastructure Liability prior to the Distribution, would 
have otherwise been so transferred, conveyed, accepted or assumed, as the 
case may be, pursuant to this Agreement, the Parties shall use reasonable 
best efforts to promptly effect such transfer, conveyance, acceptance or 
assumption of such Intellectual Property Right, Intellectual Property 
Liability, Common Infrastructure Right or Common Infrastructure Liability. 
Any transfer, conveyance, acceptance or assumption made pursuant to this 
Section 2.06(a) shall be treated by the Parties for all purposes as if it 
had occurred as of the Distribution, except as otherwise required by 
applicable Law or a Final Determination.

(b) In the event that it is discovered after the Distribution that there 
was a transfer or conveyance by Xerox (or a member of the Xerox Group) to, 
or the acceptance or assumption by, Conduent (or a member of the Conduent 
Group) of any Transferred Intellectual Property Right, Transferred 
Intellectual Property Liability, Common Infrastructure Right or Common 
Infrastructure Liability, as the case may be, that should not have been 
transferred, the Parties shall use reasonable best efforts to promptly 
transfer or convey such Transferred Intellectual Property Right, 
Transferred
 
17

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Intellectual Property Liability, Common Infrastructure Right or Common 
Infrastructure Liability back to the transferring or conveying Party or to 
rescind any acceptance or assumption of such Transferred Intellectual 
Property Right, Transferred Intellectual Property Liability, Common 
Infrastructure Right or Common Infrastructure Liability, as the case may 
be. Any transfer or conveyance made or acceptance or assumption rescinded 
pursuant to this Section 2.06(b) shall be treated by the Parties for all 
purposes as if such Transferred Intellectual Property Right, Transferred 
Intellectual Property Liability, Common Infrastructure Right or Common 
Infrastructure Liability had never been originally transferred, conveyed, 
accepted or assumed, as the case may be, except as otherwise required by 
applicable Law or a Final Determination.

(c) To the extent that any transfer or conveyance of any Intellectual 
Property Right or Common Infrastructure Right or acceptance or assumption 
of any Intellectual Property Liability or Common Infrastructure Liability 
required by this Agreement to be so transferred, conveyed, accepted or 
assumed shall not have been effected as of the Distribution Date, the 
Parties shall use reasonable best efforts to effect such transfer, 
conveyance, acceptance or assumption as promptly following the Distribution 
Date as shall be practicable. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to 
require the transfer or conveyance of any Intellectual Property Rights or 
Common Infrastructure Rights or the acceptance or assumption of any 
Intellectual Property Liabilities or Common Infrastructure Liabilities 
which by their terms or operation of Law cannot be so transferred, 
conveyed, accepted or assumed; provided, however, that the Parties shall 
use reasonable best efforts to obtain any necessary Consents for the 
transfer, conveyance, acceptance or assumption (as applicable) of all 
Transferred Intellectual Property Rights, Transferred Intellectual Property 
Liabilities, Common Infrastructure Rights and Common Infrastructure 
Liabilities required by this Agreement to be so transferred, conveyed, 
accepted or assumed; provided further that neither Party nor any member of 
its Group shall be required to contribute capital, pay or grant any 
consideration or concession in any form (including providing any letter of 
credit, guaranty or other financial accommodation) to any Person in order 
to obtain or make any such Consent. In the event that any such transfer, 
conveyance, acceptance or assumption (as applicable) has not been completed 
effective as of and after the Distribution Date, the Party retaining such 
Transferred Intellectual Property Right, Transferred Intellectual Property 
Liability, Common Infrastructure Right or Common Infrastructure Liability 
(or the member of the Partys Group retaining such Transferred Intellectual 
Property Right, Transferred Intellectual Property Liability, Common 
Infrastructure Right or Common Infrastructure Liability) shall thereafter 
hold such Intellectual Property Right or Common Infrastructure Right for 
the use and benefit of the Party entitled thereto (at the expense of the

underlying Intellectual Property Rights that are improved. Conduent shall 
not have any obligation under this Agreement to notify Xerox or the members 
of the Xerox Group of any such Improvements made by or on behalf of it or 
the members of its Group or to disclose or license any such Improvements to 
Xerox or the members of its Group.

SECTION 5.03. Inventor Compensation. Each Party will be responsible for 
providing inventor incentive compensation, if any, to its and its Group 
members employees in accordance with its own internal policies and any 
applicable laws and regulations. To the extent that a Party bases an 
inventors incentive compensation on a Patent or a Patent application of 
the other Party, the Parties will reasonably cooperate by providing to each 
other relevant information about their Patents for which one or more 
inventors are employees of the other Party. To the extent that inventor 
compensation is specified by local law, such as in Germany and Japan, the 
Parties will reasonably cooperate in providing information to each other in 
order to enable each Party to calculate inventor compensation. No Party 
shall have any obligation to provide any inventor incentive compensation to 
an employee of the other Party except as required by law. Any information 
provided under this Section 5.03 shall be subject to Section 6.03 and 
Section 7.09 of the Separation Agreement.

SECTION 5.04. No Implied Licenses. Nothing contained in this Agreement 
shall be construed as conferring any rights (including the right to 
sublicense) by implication, estoppel or otherwise, under any Intellectual 
Property Rights, other than as expressly granted in this Agreement, and all 
other rights under any Intellectual Property Rights licensed to a Party or 
the members of its Group hereunder are expressly reserved by the Party 
granting the license. The Party receiving the license hereunder 
acknowledges and agrees that the Party (or the applicable member of its 
Group) granting the license is the sole and exclusive owner of the 
Intellectual Property Rights so licensed.

SECTION 5.05. No Field Restrictions for Patent Licensing. Except as 
expressly set forth in this Agreement, each Party and the members of its 
Group shall be free to grant licenses of any sort under any of its owned 
Conduent Patents or Xerox Patents (as the case may be) to any third party 
without restriction as to field of use.

SECTION 5.06. No Obligation To Prosecute or Maintain Patents. Except as 
expressly set forth in this Agreement, no Party or any member of its Group 
shall have any obligation to seek, perfect or maintain any protection for 
any of its Intellectual Property Rights. Without limiting the generality of 
the foregoing, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, no Party or 
any member of its Group shall have any obligation to file any Patent 
application, to prosecute any Patent, or secure any Patent rights or to 
maintain any Patent in force.
 
29

------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 5.07. Technical Assistance. Except as expressly set forth in this 
Agreement, in the Separation Agreement or any other mutually executed 
agreement between the Parties or any of the members of their respective 
Groups, no Party or any member of its Group shall be required to provide 
the other Party with any technical assistance or to furnish any other Party 
with, or obtain on their behalf, any documents, materials or other 
information or Technology.

SECTION 5.08. Third-Party Infringement. No Party or any member of its Group 
shall have any obligation hereunder to institute or maintain any action or 
suit against third parties for infringement or misappropriation of any 
Intellectual Property Rights in or to any Technology licensed to the other 
Party hereunder, or to defend any action or suit brought by a third party 
which challenges or concerns the validity of any of such Intellectual 
Property Rights or which claims that any Technology licensed to the other 
Party or any member of its Group hereunder infringes or constitutes a 
misappropriation of any Intellectual Property Rights of any third party. 
Except as set forth in Section 6.03(b) of the TLA, each Party (the 
Notifying Party) may, but shall not be required to, notify the other Party 
(the Licensor) in writing upon learning that a third party may be 
infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating or impairing any 
Intellectual Property Rights of the Licensor that are licensed to the 
Notifying Party under this Agreement. Such notification shall set forth in 
reasonable specificity the identity of the suspected infringing third party 
and the nature of the suspected infringement. The Notifying Party shall not 
take any steps to contact any such third party without the Licensors prior 
written permission, and the Licensor shall have the sole discretion to 
determine whether and in what manner to address any actual or suspected 
unauthorized Third-Party use and shall be exclusively entitled to any 
remedies, including monetary damages, related thereto or resulting 
therefrom. In the event that the Licensor decides to initiate any claim 
against any third party, the Notifying Party shall reasonably cooperate 
with the Licensor, subject to Section 5.04. Any actual and reasonable 
out-of-pocket expenses associated with such cooperation shall be borne by 
the Licensor, expressly excluding the value of the time of the Notifying 
Partys personnel (regarding which the Parties shall agree on a case by 
case basis with respect to reasonable compensation).

SECTION 5.09. Copyright Notices. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary 
herein, as to works in which Conduent or any member of its Group owns the 
Copyright, to the extent any such works contain Copyright notices which 
indicate Xerox or any member of its Group as the Copyright owner, Conduent 
may, but shall not be required to, change such notices.

SECTION 5.10. No Challenge to Title. Each Party agrees that it shall not 
(and shall cause the members of its Group not to), for any reason, during 
the term of the licenses granted in Article III and Article IV, either 
itself do or authorize any third party to do any of the following anywhere 
in the world with respect to any Intellectual Property Rights licensed to 
it or the members of its Group hereunder: (a) represent to any third party 
in any manner that it owns or has any ownership rights in such Intellectual 
Property Rights; (b) apply for any registration of such Intellectual 
Property Rights (including federal, state and national registrations); or 
(c) impair, dispute or contest the validity, enforceability or 
registrability of the other Partys (or any of the members of such other 
Partys Group) right, title and interest in and to such Intellectual 
Property Rights.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 5.11. Xerox Use Covenant. Xerox agrees that it will not use the 
Retained Tier 2 Copyrights in or to the Covenant Software or the Retained 
Tier 2 Trade Secrets included in or embodied by the Covenant Software, in 
each case solely with respect to the uses identified in Schedule J hereto.

SECTION 5.12. Group Members. Each Party shall cause the members of its 
Group to comply with all applicable provisions of this Agreement.


ARTICLE VI

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION

SECTION 6.01. Contract Manufacturing. Notwithstanding anything to the 
contrary herein, each Party agrees that, in exercising its Have-Made 
rights (by Conduent, pursuant to Section 3.02, or by Xerox, pursuant to 
Section 4.02), each Party and the members of its Group may only disclose 
Trade Secrets licensed from the other Party or a member of its Group in 
Article III or Article IV to the extent expressly permitted by this 
Agreement, and then only if it has executed a written confidentiality 
agreement with the third party contract manufacturer with appropriate, 
industry standard terms, and in all cases containing terms and conditions 
pertaining to the protection of proprietary and confidential information no 
less restrictive than those set forth in this Article VI and Section 7.09 
of the Separation Agreement.

SECTION 6.02. Source Code. In addition to the provisions of Section 7.09 of 
the Separation Agreement, Xerox shall maintain the confidentiality of all 
information and documents related to all Licensed Conduent Source Code and 
Conduent shall maintain the confidentiality of all information and 
documents related to all Licensed Xerox Source Code until the expiration of 
any Copyright therein. Each Party shall use (and shall cause the members of 
its Group to use) the same degree of care as it uses to protect its own 
proprietary source code, but in any case no less than a reasonable degree 
of care, to prevent unauthorized use, dissemination or publication of the 
source code. Any third party disclosure necessary to make commercial use of 
the source code shall be made only under a confidentiality agreement with 
terms no less restrictive than those of this Article VI. Source code shall 
cease to qualify as confidential information if it (a) becomes publicly 
available without breach of this Agreement, or (b) is obtained by the 
licensed party from a third party lawfully in possession of the source code 
and which provides the source code without breach of any duty of 
confidentiality owed directly or indirectly to the source code owner 
(either Xerox or Conduent, as may be applicable). Notwithstanding the 
provisions of this Section 6.02, each Party and the members of its Group 
may disclose the source code of the other Party and the members of its 
Group if required by law, regulation or court order provided that the Party 
seeking to disclose provides to the other Party notice and a reasonable 
opportunity to object to, limit or condition the disclosure (e.g., to limit 
the disclosure to the minimum necessary to comply with the law, regulation 
or court order and for the disclosure to be made under protective order or 
other order of confidentiality).
 
31

------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 6.03. Trade Secrets. In addition to the provisions of Section 7.09 
of the Separation Agreement, Xerox shall maintain the confidentiality of 
the Transferred Trade Secrets, the Trade Secrets licensed under Section 
4.01(d) above and the Common Infrastructure Trade Secrets, and Conduent 
shall maintain the confidentiality of the Common Infrastructure Trade 
Secrets and the Trade Secrets licensed under Section 3.01(e) above. Each 
Party shall use (and shall cause the members of its Group to use) the same 
degree of care as it uses to protect its own Trade Secrets, but in any case 
no less than a reasonable degree of care, to prevent unauthorized use, 
dissemination or publication of the Trade Secrets licensed to such Party 
under Section 4.01(d) or Section 3.01(e) above, the Common Infrastructure 
Trade Secrets and, as to Xerox only, the Transferred Trade Secrets. Any 
third party disclosure by either Party necessary to exploit the Trade 
Secrets licensed to such Party under Section 4.01(d) or Section 3.01(e) 
above or the Common Infrastructure Trade Secrets shall be made only under a 
confidentiality agreement with terms no less restrictive than those of this 
Article VI. A Trade Secret shall cease to qualify as confidential 
information if it (a) becomes publicly available without breach of this 
Agreement, or (b) is obtained from a third party lawfully in possession of 
the Trade Secret and which provides the Trade Secret without breach of any 
duty of confidentiality owed directly or indirectly to the Trade Secret 
owner (either Xerox or Conduent, as may be applicable). For the avoidance 
of doubt, neither Party shall seek registration of a Patent based on any 
invention disclosure licensed to such Party under Section 4.01(d) or 
Section 3.01(e) above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 6.03, 
each Party and the members of its Group may disclose the Trade Secret 
information of the other Party and the members of its Group (i) if required 
by law, regulation or court order provided that the Party seeking to 
disclose provides notice and a reasonable opportunity to object to, limit 
or condition the disclosure (e.g., to limit the disclosure to the minimum 
necessary to comply with the law, regulation or court order and for the 
disclosure to be made under protective order or other order of 
confidentiality), or (ii) with the other Partys prior written consent.


ARTICLE VII

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND WARRANTY DISCLAIMER

SECTION 7.01. Limitation of Liability. Except as may expressly be set forth 
in this Agreement, none of Xerox, Conduent or any other member of either 
Group shall in any event have any Liability to the other or to any other 
member of the others Group, or to any other Xerox Indemnitee or Conduent 
Indemnitee, as applicable, under this Agreement (i) with respect to any 
matter to the extent that such Party seeking indemnification or any member 
of its Group has engaged in any knowing violation of Law or fraud in 
connection therewith or (ii) for any indirect, special, punitive or 
consequential damages, whether or not caused by or resulting from 
negligence or breach of obligations hereunder and whether or not informed 
of the possibility of the existence of such damages; provided, however, 
that the provisions of this Section 7.01(ii) shall not limit (a) a Partys 
indemnification obligations with respect to any Liability any
 
32

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Indemnitee may have to any third party not affiliated with any member of 
the Xerox Group or the Conduent Group for any indirect, special, punitive 
or consequential damages, or (b) the damages available to a Party for (i) 
infringement or misappropriation of its Intellectual Property Rights by the 
other Party or any member of the other Partys Group, or (ii) breaches of 
Article VI.

SECTION 7.02. Disclaimer of Representations and Warranties. Each of Xerox 
(on behalf of itself and each other member of the Xerox Group) and Conduent 
(on behalf of itself and each other member of the Conduent Group) 
understands and agrees that, except as expressly set forth in this 
Agreement, no Party is representing or warranting in any way, including any 
implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, 
title, registerability, allowability, enforceability or non-infringement, 
as to any Intellectual Property Rights or Intellectual Property Liabilities 
transferred or assumed as contemplated hereby, as to the sufficiency of the 
Intellectual Property Rights or Intellectual Property Liabilities 
transferred or assumed hereby for the conduct and operations of the BPO 
Business or the Xerox Business, as applicable, as to any Governmental 
Approvals or other Consents required in connection therewith or in 
connection with any past transfers of the Intellectual Property Rights or 
assumptions of the Intellectual Property Liabilities, as to the value or 
freedom from any Security Interests of, or any other matter concerning, any 
Intellectual Property Rights or Intellectual Property Liabilities of such 
Party, or as to the absence of any defenses or rights of set-off or freedom 
from counterclaim with respect to any claim or other Intellectual Property 
Rights, of any such Party, or as to the legal sufficiency of any 
assignment, document or instrument delivered hereunder to convey title to 
any Intellectual Property Rights or thing of value upon the execution, 
delivery and filing hereof or thereof. Except as may expressly be set forth 
herein, any such Intellectual Property Rights are being transferred on an 
as is, where is basis and the respective transferees shall bear the 
economic and legal risks that (a) any conveyance shall prove to be 
insufficient to vest in the transferee good and marketable title, free and 
clear of any Security Interest, and (b) any necessary Governmental 
Approvals or other Consents are not obtained or that any requirements of 
Laws or judgments are not complied with.


ARTICLE VIII

TRANSFERABILITY AND ASSIGNMENT

SECTION 8.01. No Assignment or Transfer Without Consent. Except as 
expressly set forth in this Agreement, neither this Agreement nor any of 
the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement, including the 
Intellectual Property Rights licenses granted pursuant to this Agreement, 
shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by 
either Party or any member of its Group without the prior written consent 
of the other Party. Any purported assignment without such consent shall be 
void. Subject to the preceding sentences, this Agreement will be binding 
upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties and their 
respective successors and assigns. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either 
Party may assign this Agreement without consent in connection with (a) a 
merger transaction in which such Party is not the surviving entity and the 
surviving entity acquires or assumes all or substantially all of
 
33

------------------------------------------------------------------------
such Partys assets, or (b) the sale of all or substantially all of such 
Partys assets; provided, however, that the assignee expressly assumes in 
writing all of the obligations of the assigning Party under this Agreement, 
and the assigning Party provides written notice and evidence of such 
assignment and assumption to the non-assigning Party. For the avoidance of 
doubt, in no event will the licenses granted in this Agreement extend to 
products, product lines, services, apparatus, devices, systems, components, 
hardware, software, processes, solutions, any combination of the foregoing, 
or other offerings of the assignee existing on or before the date of the 
transaction described in clauses (a) or (b) of the preceding sentence, 
except to the extent that they were licensed under the terms of this 
Agreement prior to such transaction.

SECTION 8.02. Divested Businesses. In the event a Party divests a business 
by (a) spinning off a member of its Group by its sale or other disposition 
to a third party, (b) reducing ownership or control in a member of its 
Group so that it no longer qualifies as a member of its Group under this 
Agreement, or (c) selling or otherwise transferring a line of business to a 
third party, and provided that (1) the divested entity/line of business is 
maintained as a separate corporate entity or the entity/line of business is 
merged with the acquiring entity but maintained as a separately 
identifiable line of business, and (2) the divested entity/line of business 
includes at least one marketable product or service in a product or service 
line and tangible assets having a net value of at least $25,000,000; (each 
such divested entity/line of business, a Divested Entity), the Divested 
Entity shall retain those licenses granted to it under this Agreement 
provided that the license granted shall be limited in the 12 months 
immediately following such divestiture to a volume of licensed products or 
services having an aggregate selling price equal to no more than the 
aggregate selling prices of such products or services by said Divested 
Entity in the 12 months preceding such divestiture plus 10%; and shall be 
limited, in each of the successive 12-month periods following such transfer 
or spin off, to a volume of licensed products or services having an 
aggregate selling price equal to no more than the limit for the immediately 
preceding 12-month period plus 10%. The retention of any license grants are 
subject to the Divested Entitys and, in the event it is acquired by a 
third party, such third partys execution and delivery to the 
non-transferring Party, within 90 days of the effective date of such 
assignment, of a duly authorized, written undertaking, agreeing to be bound 
by the applicable terms of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, in 
no event shall any license retained by a former entity/line of business (as 
the case may be) by virtue of the divestiture of a Divested Entity (i) be 
broader than the licenses originally conveyed to a Party under the terms of 
this Agreement, or (ii) apply to any products, product lines, services, 
apparatus, devices, systems, components, hardware, software, processes, 
solutions, any combination of the foregoing, or other offerings of any 
third party acquirer, other than the Conduent Products or the Xerox 
Products (as the case may be) that were transferred to the former 
entity/line of business under the divestiture of a Divested Entity, or 
(iii) convey any further rights under this Section 8.02 after the initial 
divestiture of a Divested Entity. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event 
that the divested entity/line of business is not a Divested Entity, then 
the licenses granted to the divested entity/line of business shall 
terminate as of the date the divested entity/line of business is divested.

in this Agreement to the contrary, Section 5.05, Article VI, Article VII,

Agreement.

done, all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable under 
applicable Laws and agreements to consummate and make effective the 
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, prior to, on and after the Distribution 
Date, each Party shall cooperate with the other Party, without any further 
consideration, but at the expense of the requesting Party, (i) to execute 
and deliver, or use reasonable best efforts to execute and deliver, or 
cause to be executed and delivered, all instruments, including any 
instruments of conveyance, assignment and transfer as such Party may 
reasonably be requested to execute and deliver by the other Party, (ii) to 
make, or cause to be made, all filings with, and to obtain, or cause to be 
obtained, all Consents of any Governmental Authority or any other Person 
under any permit, license, agreement, indenture or other instrument, and 
(iii) to take, or cause to be taken, all such other actions as such Party 
may reasonably be requested to take by the other Party from time to time, 
consistent with the terms of this Agreement, in order to effectuate the 
provisions and purposes of this Agreement and any transfers of Intellectual 
Property Rights or assignments and assumptions of Transferred Intellectual 
Property Liabilities and Common Infrastructure Liabilities hereunder.

(c) On or prior to the Distribution Date, Xerox and Conduent, in their 
respective capacities as direct and indirect shareholders of their 
respective Subsidiaries, shall each ratify any actions that are reasonably 
necessary or desirable to be taken by Conduent or any other member of the 
Xerox Group, as the case may be, to effectuate the transactions 
contemplated by this Agreement.

discontinuance of steps to enforce such right or power, or any course of

in equity, and all such rights and remedies shall be cumulative. The other 
Party shall not oppose the granting of such relief on the basis that money 
damages are an adequate remedy. The Parties agree that the remedies at Law 
for any breach or threatened breach hereof, including monetary damages, are 
inadequate compensation for any loss and that any defense in any action for 
specific performance that a remedy at Law would be adequate is waived. Any 
requirements for the securing or posting of any bond with such remedy are 
waived.

amendment, supplement or modification is in writing and signed by the 
authorized representative of each Party.
