Dear Patrick:
 
Reference is made to your Severance Agreement (the “Severance Agreement”) 
dated June 3, 2015 with Determine, Inc. This letter hereby amends the 
Severance Agreement as follows:
 
1. Section 2 (Equity Acceleration) shall be amended and replaced with the 
following:  
 
2. EQUITY ACCELERATION. 
 
If the Company is subject to a Change in Control before the Employee’s 
employment terminates, then all equity awards held by the Employee shall 
become fully and unconditionally vested, fully exercisable and fully 
transferable (except for transfer restrictions imposed by law). For 
purposes of this Section 2, the Employee’s “equity awards” shall consist of 
(a) shares of the capital stock of the Company (“Stock”), (b) stock units, 
performance units or phantom shares whose value is measured by the value of 
shares of Stock and (c) stock appreciation rights whose value is measured 
by increases in the value of shares of Stock.
 
All other terms of the Agreement shall remain the same. Please indicate 
your agreement with these terms by countersigning below.
 
 
 
Very truly yours,
