    14.                               Insurance.  Pharmacy shall maintain
    in effect during the term of this Agreement a comprehensive general
    liability policy underwritten by an insurance company that carries an
    [***] or better rating from A.M. Best.  This comprehensive insurance
    policy shall be in an amount not less than [***] per occurrence. 
    Pharmacy shall provide [***] days notice to Manufacturer in the event
    of any cancellation, or termination thereof.  Pharmacy shall provide
    Manufacturer with a certificate of insurance evidencing compliance with
    this Section upon execution of this Agreement.  The amount of such
    required insurance coverage under this Section shall not limit
    Pharmacys obligations under this Agreement.

    15.                               Miscellaneous.
 
        15.1.                     Assignability and Notice of Change of
        Control.  Except as specifically provided herein, this Agreement,
        or any of the rights or obligations created herein, may not be
        assigned, in whole or in part, by either Party without the written
        consent of the other Party; provided, however, that either Party
        may assign this Agreement without the consent of the other Party to
        (i) any affiliate or (ii) in connection with the acquisition, sale
        or other transfer of all or substantially all of its assets or
        business to which this Agreement relates.  The rights and
        obligations contained herein shall inure to the benefit of each
        Partys successors and permitted assigns, and shall be binding on
        and enforceable against the relevant Partys successors and
        permitted assigns.  Any purported assignment not in accordance with
        this Agreement shall be void.
 
        15.2.                     Amendment.  This Agreement may only be
        amended, modified or supplemented by an agreement in writing signed
        by each Party hereto.  No waiver by any Party of any of the
        provisions hereof shall be effective unless explicitly set forth in
        writing and signed by the Party so waiving.  Except as otherwise
        set forth in this Agreement, no failure to exercise, or delay in
        exercising, any rights, remedy, power or privilege arising from
        this Agreement shall operate or be construed as a waiver thereof;
        nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy,
        power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise
        thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or
        privilege.
 
        15.3.                     Non-Exclusivity.  Subject to Section 1.1,
        Manufacturer and Pharmacy mutually agree that this Agreement is
        non-exclusive and that each party is free to contract and deal with
        other parties, including competitors of the other.  During the
        Term, Pharmacy shall not enter into any agreement which will cause
        it to be in breach or default or conflict with Pharmacys
        obligations under this Agreement.
 
        15.4.                     Force Majeure.  The performance by either
        Party hereunder shall be excused to the extent of circumstances
        beyond such Partys reasonable control, including, without
        limitation, hurricane, tropical storm or depression, extended power
        outages, flood, tornado, earthquake, or other natural disaster,
        epidemic, war, acts of terrorism, material destruction of
        facilities, fire, or acts of God.  In such event, the affected
        Party will, as promptly as reasonably possible, give the other
        Party written notice thereof and all obligations under this
        Agreement will be immediately suspended for the duration of the
        force major event (except for those rights and obligations that
        have already accrued); provided that the affected Party promptly
        undertakes all reasonable efforts necessary to cure such force
        major event; provided, further, that if performance is not restored
        within ninety (90) days, either Party may terminate this Agreement
        upon thirty (30) days prior written notice.  As a matter of
        clarify, Pharmacy may purchase Product from other parties during
        any such force major event which limits Manufacturers ability to
        perform.
 
        15.5.                     Notices.  Any notices to be given by
        either Party to the other shall be in writing and may be

Jonathan M. Young, Ph.D., J.D.
General Counsel
Braeburn Pharmaceuticals
47 Hulfish Street, Suite 441
Princeton, New Jersey 08542
 
Dear Dr. Young:
 
This responds to your letter to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) 
dated June 8, 2016, in which you inquired about a pharmacy delivering 
controlled substances to the prescribing practitioner, rather than directly 
to the patient, under certain circumstances.
 
As you know, as a general matter, the DEA cannot provide individuals with 
definitive, private legal opinions about whether their particular 
activities relating to controlled substances comply with the requirements 
of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) and DEA regulations.  Among the 
reasons for this is that such letters cannot establish a rule that is 
legally binding on the recipient or the agency.  At the same time, the DEA 
recognizes the importance of working with regulated entities to help guide 
them toward compliance with the law and regulations.  In that vein, we can 
provide the following general information.
 
For purposes of this letter, we will address the following hypothetical 
scenario:
 
    ·                  A DEA-registered practitioner, acting in the usual
    course of his/her professional practice, issues a prescription for a
    controlled substance for a legitimate medical purpose, and the
    prescription complies in all other respects with DEA regulations.
 
    ·                  The practitioner determines, in the exercise of
    his/her sound medical discretion, that it is appropriate for the
    practitioner to administer the controlled substance directly to the
    patient at the practitioners registered location.
 
    ·                  The prescription is for a single dose of the
    controlled substance for a particular patient - not a take-home supply
    for that patient and not for the practitioners office stock.
 
    ·                  The practitioner indicates on the prescription that
    the controlled substance should be delivered by the pharmacy to the
    practitioner, at his/her registered location, for administration to the
    patient.
 
    ·                  The above activity is carried out in compliance with
    applicable State law and regulations.
 
Neither the CSA nor DEA regulations specifically address the foregoing 
scenario.  Nonetheless, assuming all the foregoing facts apply, the DEA 
would consider it permissible under the CSA and DEA regulations for the 
pharmacy to deliver the controlled substance to the practitioner, at 
his/her registered location, provided the following conditions are met:
 
    ·                  The pharmacy treats its actions as a dispensing for
    purposes of the CSA and DEA regulations and complies with all
    applicable requirements thereunder.  This includes, but

    is not limited to, keeping records indicating that the controlled
    substance was delivered to the practitioner and including the
    practitioners name and address of the registered location to which it
    was delivered.
 
    ·                  The practitioner treats his/her actions as
    administering for purposes of the CSA and DEA regulations and complies
    with all applicable requirements thereunder.  This includes, but is not
    limited to, keeping records, to the extent required for the
    administering of controlled substances, and maintaining security as
    required by the regulations.
 
Finally, please be advised that while this letter represents the current 
view of the DEA, it is not a binding rule.  The DEA is continuing to 
evaluate the issues related to your inquiry to determine whether it would 
be appropriate for the agency to propose an amendment to its regulations to 
specifically address this topic.
