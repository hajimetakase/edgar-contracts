faith with Braeburn unless and until the Board of Directors of Titan 
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal and 
financial advisors) that such Braeburn proposal does not constitute and 
could not reasonably be expected to result in a transaction that is more 
favorable to Titans stockholders from a financial point of view than the 
transactions contemplated by the Acquisition Proposal, after taking into

effective date of a Subject Transaction or (ii) any activities relating to 
products developed by an Acquiring Entity (or any other Third Party) 
without accessing or practicing technology or information made available to 
Braeburn under this Agreement; provided that, such Subject Transaction

Titan, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

    be made only by mutual prior agreement of the Parties, except as

    (iii)                               Braeburn shall have sole authority
    and responsibility to develop, modify, seek and/or obtain any necessary
    Regulatory Approvals of any Product Labeling, packaging, advertising or
    other promotional or informational materials used in connection with
    Product in the Territory, and Promotional Materials and for determining
    whether the same requires Regulatory Approval;
 
    (iv)                              Braeburn will be the primary contact
    with the Regulatory Authorities and shall be solely responsible for all

6.3                               Third Party Patent Rights and Royalty 
Stacking.
 
(a)                                 If, during the Agreement Term, Braeburn 
identifies the need for a license to a Patent Right in the Territory not 
Controlled by Titan that Braeburn in good faith reasonably believes is 
necessary for Braeburn, its Affiliates or any sublicensee to exercise its 
rights hereunder (a Third Party Patent Right), prior to entering into an 
agreement with respect to a license to such Third Party Patent Right, 
Braeburn shall notify Titan (a Third Party Patent Right Notice).  Upon 
receipt of the Third Party Patent Right Notice, Titan shall notify Braeburn 
whether it agrees with, or objects to, Braeburns need for such Third Party 
Patent Right, no later than ten (10) Business Days following Titans 
receipt of the Third Party Patent Right Notice.  In the event Titan agrees 
with, or fails to timely object to, the need for such Third Party Patent 
Right, Titan and Braeburn shall coordinate and act in good faith to enter 
into a commercially reasonable license agreement or agreements with such 
Third Party granting Titan and Braeburn licenses to such Third Party Patent 
Rights in the Titan Territory and the Territory, respectively.  In the 
event Titan timely objects to the need for such Third Party Patent Right (a 
Third Party Patent Right Dispute), such Third Party Patent Right Dispute 
shall be resolved using an independent Third Party patent counsel selected 
by Braeburn and reasonably acceptable to Titan.  The Parties agree that the 
decision of such patent counsel shall be final and binding and not subject 
to Article 15 or Section 16.6, [***].  For the avoidance of doubt, if Titan 
agrees with, or fails to timely object to, the need for such Third Party 
Patent Right, or the independent Third Party patent counsel finds that such 
Third Party Patent Rights are necessary for the sale of the Licensed 
Product in the Territory, Braeburn shall have the right, in its sole 
discretion, to enter into a definitive license agreement for such Third 
Party Patent Rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions and 
shall provide a copy of such license agreement to Titan.
 
(b)                                 If in accordance with this Section 6.3
, Braeburn enters into an agreement with a Third Party in order to obtain 
licenses under such Third Party Patent Rights then, upon entry into any 
such agreement(s) and thereafter during the remainder of the Agreement 
Term, the amounts payable under Section 6.2 shall be reduced by [***] 
percent ([***]%) of the royalties on net sales of Licensed Product paid by 
or on behalf of Braeburn to such Third Party(ies) in connection with 
obtaining such rights; provided however, that in no event shall the Royalty 
payable to Titan be reduced as a result of this Section 6.3 by more than 
[***] percent ([***]%) of the Royalties otherwise due to Titan in a 
particular Calendar Quarter; and provided, further, that amounts payable to 
such Third Party that are not used by Braeburn in a particular Calendar 
Quarter to reduce the Royalties due to Titan in such Calendar Quarter may 
be carried over to subsequent Calendar Quarters until fully used in 
accordance with this Section 6.3.
 
6.4                               Reports and Payments.

of each Calendar Quarter following Launch that begins or ends during the

or any other provision of this Agreement are not made on or prior to the 
required payment date, the amount of the late payment shall bear interest 
at the per annum rate of [***], or the maximum rate allowable by Law,

Quarters or twelve consecutive months, as applicable.
 
6.5                               Taxes.  Titan alone shall be responsible 
for paying any and all taxes (other than withholding taxes required by Law 
to be paid by Braeburn) levied on account of, or measured in whole or in 
part by reference to, any payments it receives under this Agreement.  
Braeburn shall deduct or withhold from such payments any taxes that it is 
required Law to deduct or withhold.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if 
Titan is entitled under any applicable tax treaty to a reduction of rate 
of, or the elimination of, applicable withholding tax, it may deliver to 
Braeburn or the appropriate Governmental Authority (with the assistance of 
Braeburn to the extent that this is reasonably required and is expressly 
requested in writing) the forms (completed in a manner satisfactory to 
Braeburn) necessary to reduce the applicable rate of withholding or to 
relieve Braeburn of its obligation to withhold tax, and Braeburn shall 
apply the reduced rate of withholding, or dispense with withholding, as the 
case may be, provided that Braeburn has received evidence, in a form 
satisfactory to Braeburn, of Titans delivery of all applicable forms (and, 
if necessary, its receipt of appropriate governmental authorization) at 
least fifteen (15) days prior to the time that the payments are due.  If, 
in accordance with the foregoing, Braeburn withholds any amount, it shall 
make timely payment to the proper taxing authority of the withheld amount 
and send to Titan proof of such payment as soon as reasonably practicable 
following that payment.

    Party (the Audited Party) and at a mutually agreeable time, but in no
    event more than once in any twelve (12) month period, shall permit an
    independent certified public accounting firm of recognized standing
    selected by the Audited Party and reasonably acceptable to the Auditing
    Party, to have access during normal business hours to the records of
    the Audited Party as may be reasonably necessary to verify, in the case
    of Braeburns records, the accuracy of the reports, including the
    Royalty Report, under Section 6.4, and in the case of Titans records,
    the calculation of any Fully Burdened Cost or Product Procurement
    Costs; provided however, that any audit conducted under this Section
    6.6 may only be for any year or years ending not more than thirty-six
    (36) months prior to the date of such request.  The accounting firm
    shall disclose to the Auditing Party only whether the reports are
    correct or incorrect, the specific details concerning any discrepancies
    (including, if applicable, the accuracy of the calculation of Net
    Sales, and the resulting effect of such calculations on the amounts
    payable by the Audited Party under this Agreement), but no other
    information shall be disclosed to such Auditing Party.
 
    (ii)                                  If there is a dispute between the
    Parties following any audit performed pursuant to Section 6.6(a)(i),
    either Party may refer the issue (an Audit Disagreement) to a second
    independent certified public accounting firm of recognized standing
    (the Independent Expert) for resolution.  In the event an Audit
    Disagreement is submitted for resolution by either Party, the Parties
    shall comply with the following procedures:

conditions of this Agreement, (i) Braeburn shall have the right to use, 
practice and otherwise exploit any and all Titan Inventions and Joint 
Inventions in the Territory, (ii) Titan reserves the right to use, practice 
or otherwise exploit any and all Titan Inventions and/or Joint Inventions, 
and (iii) neither Party shall have any obligation to account to the other

assign or otherwise exploit Joint Inventions in the Territory, by reason of 
joint ownership thereof, and each Party hereby waives any right it may have 
under the Laws of any jurisdiction to require any such approval or 
accounting.
 
8.2                               Maintenance and Prosecution.  Braeburn

Braeburn agrees to keep Titan informed of the course of patent prosecution 
or other proceedings, including by providing Titan with copies of office 
actions and communications received by Braeburn from, and communications 
sent by Braeburn to, the United States Patent and Trademark Office and

application or patent.  If Braeburn elects not to Prosecute and Maintain a 
patent application or patent included in such Patent Rights in the 
Territory, it shall provide Titan with no less than ninety (90) days 
written advance notice sufficient to avoid any loss or forfeiture.  In such 
event Titan shall have the right, but not the obligation, at its sole 
expense, to Prosecute and Maintain such patent application or patent as 
owner thereof and, at Titans election and upon not less than thirty (30) 
days prior written notice to Braeburn, such patent application or patent 
shall no longer be deemed or included in Patent Rights under this 
Agreement.  Titan shall have the sole right to Prosecute and Maintain any 
patent application(s) or patent(s) arising from the Titan Inventions, at 
its sole expense.
 
8.3                               Third Party Infringement.

other Party notice of, and share all available information in connection 
with, any actual or suspected infringement in the Territory of any patent 
included in the Titan Patent Rights and the Parties interests in Joint 
Inventions (collectively, the Parties Patent Rights), which comes to 
such Partys attention.  The Parties will thereafter consult and cooperate 
to determine a course of action, including the commencement of legal action 
by any Party.

judgment action relating to the Titan Core Patents in the Territory.  Titan 
shall render, at its expense, all assistance reasonably requested in 
connection with any action taken by Braeburn or to prevent such 
infringement.  However, the control of such action, including whether to 
initiate any legal proceeding and/or the settlement thereof, shall solely 
be under the control of Braeburn; provided that Braeburn shall not, settle 
any such claim or

Agreement, restricts in any material respect the future enforcement of the 
Titan Patent Rights, or results in any monetary payment by or financial 
loss to Titan, without Titans written consent, which consent shall not be 
unreasonably withheld.
 
(c)                                  If, within a period of ninety (90) 
days after the first notice of infringement is provided under Section 
8.3(a) Braeburn elects not to initiate and prosecute an infringement or

agreed-upon course of action, including the costs of any legal action 
commenced or any declaratory judgment action defended, shall be borne

Titan, provided that Titan shall not, settle any such claim or proceeding

in the event that any Party is unable to initiate, prosecute, or defend 
such action solely in its own name, the other Party will join such action 
voluntarily and will execute all documents necessary for the Party to 
defend, prosecute and maintain such action.  In connection with any such 
action, the Parties will cooperate fully and will provide each other with 
any information or assistance that either reasonably may request.  Any 
recovery or award obtained by either Party as a result of any such action 
or settlement shall be shared as follows:
 
    (i)                                     the Party that initiated and
    prosecuted or maintained the defense of, the action shall recoup all of
    its costs and expenses (including all court and reasonable attorneys
    fees) incurred in connection with the action, whether the recovery is
    by settlement or otherwise;
 
    (ii)                                  the other Party then shall, to
    the extent possible, recover its reasonably documented costs and
    expenses (including reasonable outside attorneys fees) incurred in
    connection with the action;
 
    (iii)                               if Titan initiated and prosecuted,
    or maintained the defense of, the action, the amount of any recovery
    remaining then shall be retained by Titan; and
 
    (iv)                              if Braeburn initiated and prosecuted,
    or maintained the defense of, the action, the amount of any recovery
    remaining shall be retained by Braeburn, net of an amount that shall be
    paid to Titan equal to the Royalties that would have been payable to
    Titan if such remainder of the recovery or settlement proceeds
    constituted Net Sales.
 
8.4                               Third Party Intellectual Property.
 
(a)                                 In the event that a Party becomes aware 
of any claim that the manufacture, import, use, offer for sale, or sale of 
a Product hereunder infringes the intellectual property rights of any Third 
Party in the Territory, such Party shall promptly notify the other Party.

(b)                                 Braeburn shall have the first right, 
but not the obligation, to defend any action in the Territory related to 
the intellectual property rights of any Third Party or to initiate and 
prosecute legal action related to the intellectual property rights of any 
Third Party at its own expense and in the name of Titan and/or Braeburn.  
Titan shall render, at its expense, all assistance reasonably requested in 
connection with any action taken by Braeburn.  However, the control of such 
action, including whether to initiate any legal proceeding and/or the 
settlement thereof, shall solely be under the control of Braeburn; 
provided that Braeburn shall not, settle any such claim or proceeding in a 
manner that adversely affects Titans rights under this Agreement, 
restricts in any material respect the future enforcement of the Titan 
Patent Rights, or results in any monetary payment by or financial loss to 
Titan, without Titans written consent, which consent shall not be 
unreasonably withheld.
 
(c)                                  If Braeburn elects not to defend an 
infringement action in any country in the Territory as provided in Section 
8.4(b), and Titan elects to do so, the cost of any agreed-upon course of 
action, including the costs of any legal action commenced or any 
infringement action defended, shall be borne solely by Titan; provided 
that Titan shall not, settle any such claim or proceeding relating to the 
Parties Patent Rights licensed hereunder in a manner that adversely

8.5                               Patent Term Extensions.  The Parties 
shall cooperate with each other in obtaining patent term extensions or 
restorations or supplemental protection certificates or their equivalents 
in any country in the Territory where applicable and where desired by 
either Party.  Any expenses incurred by the Parties in connection with the 
foregoing shall be (a) shared equally if both Parties agree to pursue such 
patent term extension or restoration or supplemental protection 
certificates or their equivalents or (b) borne by Braeburn if Titan does 
not agree that the Parties should pursue such patent term extension or 
restoration or supplemental protection certificates or their equivalents.  
If elections with respect to obtaining such extension or supplemental 
protection certificates are to be made, Titan shall have the right but not 
the obligation to make the election.  If Titan chooses in its sole 
discretion not to pursue such patent term extension, then at Braeburns 
request Titan, shall authorize Braeburn to act as Titans agent for the 
purpose of making any application for any extensions of the term of any 
such Titan Patent Rights in the Territory and Titan shall provide all 
reasonable assistance therefore to Braeburn at Braeburns expense.

9.2                               Maintenance.  The Parties shall use 
Commercially Reasonable Efforts to maintain their respective registrations 
of the Product Trademarks in the Territory.  If necessary to permit Titan 
to use any Product Trademarks registered by Braeburn after the Effective 
Date, and in accordance with such use, Braeburn shall make application to 
register Titan as a permitted user or registered user of such Product 
Trademarks.
 
9.3                               Use of Product Trademarks.  All packaging 
materials, package inserts, labels, labeling, and marketing, sales, 
advertising and Promotional Materials relating to Products and distributed 
in the Territory shall properly display the Product Trademark notice in the 
form and style and with a placement determined by Braeburn.
 
9.4                               Enforcement.  Braeburn and Titan shall 
cooperate with each other and use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to 
protect the Product Trademarks from infringement by Third Parties.  Without 
limiting the foregoing, each Party shall promptly notify the other Party of 
any known, threatened or suspected infringement, imitation or unauthorized 
use of or unfair competition relating to the Product Trademarks and shall 
share with the other Party all information available to it regarding such 
infringement.  Braeburn shall have the first right to determine in its 
discretion whether to and to what extent to institute, prosecute and/or 
defend any action or proceedings involving or affecting any rights relating 
to the Product Trademarks in the Territory.  Upon Braeburns reasonable 
request, Titan shall cooperate with and assist Braeburn in any of 
Braeburns enforcement efforts with respect to the Product Trademarks in 
the Territory.  If Braeburn determines not to take action against any 
actual or suspected infringement of the Product Trademark in the Territory 
within ninety (90) days after having become aware of such infringement, 
then Titan shall have the right, but not the obligation, to bring or assume 
control of any action against the allegedly infringing Third Party as Titan 
determines may be necessary in its sole discretion.  In the event that 
Titan brings or assumes control of any such action, then Braeburn agrees to 
reasonably assist Titan in connection therewith.  The Parties shall share 
equally in all costs and expenses reasonably incurred by either of them in 
connection with any such action, and, following each Partys recovery of 
its respective costs and expenses, the Parties will share equally in all 
money damages, if any, recovered in connection with such action.
 
9.5                               Avoidance of Confusion.  Neither Titan 
nor Braeburn, nor any of their Affiliates nor licenses nor sublicensees, 
respectively, shall market, promote, sell and/or distribute in the 
Territory, or authorize or permit another to market, promote, sell and/or 
distribute in the Territory, any product other than a Product under the 
Product Trademarks or any confusingly similar trademark.  Titan shall not 
contest the validity of or Braeburns rights in the Product Trademarks in 
the Territory or assist any Third Party in doing so.  In the event that 
actual confusion should arise, or either Party reasonably believes that a 
likelihood of confusion may arise, in connection with the Parties 
respective uses of the Product Trademarks in the Territory, the Parties 
will fully cooperate in an effort to eliminate such confusion and to avoid 
the possibility of such a likelihood of confusion.

with the applicable Regulatory Authority of all Adverse Experience reports 
in the Territory, (b) after the NDA Transfer Date, Braeburn shall be 
responsible for the timely filing with the applicable Regulatory Authority 
of all Adverse Experience reports in the Territory, and (c) during the 
Agreement Term, Titan shall be responsible for the timely filing with the 
applicable Regulatory Authority of all Adverse Experience reports in the 
Titan Territory.  Such operating procedures shall provide for the exchange 
of safety information between the Parties sufficient to enable each Party 
to comply with its legal obligations to report to the applicable Regulatory 
Authority, include any measures necessary for each Party to comply with 
Laws applicable to such Party.  Each Party shall promptly provide the other 
Party with copies of all such reports, analyses, summaries and all 
submissions to the FDA or any other Regulatory Authority.  The Adverse 
Experience procedures utilized in the preparation and filing of such 
reports will incorporate the provisions set forth in Section 10.2.  The 
Parties agree to enter into a pharmacovigilance agreement prior to Launch.
 
10.2                        Reporting.  Prior to Launch, Braeburn will 
establish a toll-free phone number for patients, physicians and others to 
report Adverse Experiences.  The costs of such reporting and of all 
services provided by any Third Party contractor in connection with Adverse 
Experiences hereunder shall be borne by Braeburn.  Braeburn or a Third 
Party contractor will timely collect reasonable information about the 
Adverse Experiences, initiate and conduct reasonably required 
investigations, interact with Titan if physical or other testing of a 
Product appears to be reasonably required, determine the nature of the 
Adverse Experience based on data and reports it has obtained, and issue any 
reports, analyses or summaries of its activities as may be required by Law, 
including, prior to the NDA Transfer Date, providing to Titan on a timely 
basis such reports, which, in form and substance, are necessary and 
appropriate for Titan to file such periodic reports on a timely basis with 
the applicable Regulatory Authority.  Copies of all such reports, including 
reports filed by Titan with the applicable Regulatory Authority, will be 
promptly provided to Braeburn.

this Article 10 to the contrary, prior to the NDA Transfer Date, Titan 
shall have the right, at its own cost and expense, to conduct any 
investigations required under Law(s), and, subject to Section 4.2(a), to 
communicate with the FDA or the applicable Regulatory Authority regarding 
the results of those investigations, regarding Products and Product 
quality; provided, however, that upon Titans request, Braeburn shall 
provide reasonable assistance and cooperation in connection with any such 
investigations at Titans cost and expense.

precautions to safeguard and protect the confidentiality of the Proprietary 
Information; (ii) remain responsible for any failure by any Person who 
receives Proprietary Information pursuant to this Article 11 to treat such 
Proprietary Information as required under this Article 11; and (iii) take 
all reasonable measures to restrain the receiving Party and any such 
Persons from prohibited or unauthorized disclosure or use in violation of 
this Article 11; or
 
(c)                                  if required to be disclosed by Law or

non-disclosing Party in order to provide an opportunity to challenge or 
limit the disclosure obligations.
 
If and whenever any Proprietary Information is disclosed in accordance with 
this Section 11.2, such disclosure shall not cause any such information to 
cease to be Proprietary Information except to the extent that such 
disclosure results in a public disclosure of such information (other than 
in breach of this Agreement).  Where reasonably possible and subject to 
Section 11.3, the receiving Party shall notify the disclosing Party of the 
receiving Partys intent to make such disclosure pursuant to Sections 
11.2(a)-(c) sufficiently prior to making such disclosure so as to allow the 
disclosing Party adequate time to take whatever action it may deem 
appropriate to

protect the confidentiality of the information, and the receiving Party 
shall cooperate with the disclosing Party in such efforts.
 
11.3                        Disclosure of Agreement to Governmental 
Authority.  Without limiting any of the foregoing, it is understood that 
the Parties or their Affiliates may make disclosure of this Agreement and 
the terms hereof in any filings required by the United States Securities 
and Exchange Commission and any successor agency having substantially the 
same functions (the SEC), other Governmental Authority or securities 
exchange, may file this Agreement as an exhibit to any filing with the SEC, 
other governmental authority or securities exchange, and may distribute any 
such filing in the ordinary course of its business; provided however, that 
the Party seeking such disclosure first provides the other Party a copy of 
the proposed disclosure, and provided further that (except to the extent 
that the Party seeking disclosure is required to disclose such information 
to comply with applicable Law) if the other Party demonstrates to the 
reasonable satisfaction of the Party seeking disclosure, within two (2) 
Business Days of such Partys providing the copy, that the public 
disclosure of previously undisclosed information will materially adversely 
affect the development and/or commercialization of a Product, the Party 
seeking disclosure will remove from the disclosure such specific previously 
undisclosed information as the other Party shall reasonably request to be 
removed, or otherwise provide a good faith reason to the other Party why 
such disclosure was not removed.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, with 
respect to a SEC filing that includes this Agreement or any amendment 
hereto, the Party seeking the disclosure shall provide the other Party two 
(2) Business Days to review such disclosure and propose redactions to the 
Agreement to be filed with the SEC, which proposed redactions shall be 
considered in good faith.
 
11.4                        Publications.  Titan and Braeburn each 
acknowledge the other Partys interest in publishing its results related to 
Products to obtain recognition within the scientific community and to 
advance the state of scientific knowledge.  Each Party also recognizes the 
mutual interest in obtaining valid patent protection and in protecting 
business interests and trade secret information.  Accordingly, neither 
Party shall submit for written or oral publication any manuscript, abstract 
or the like relating to Products without the prior review by the other 
Party.  Any Party proposing to submit such publication shall deliver the 
proposed publication or an outline of the oral disclosure at least ten (10) 
Business Days prior to planned submission or presentation (twenty-four (24) 
hours for a meeting abstract).  At the reasonable request of the other 
Party, the submission of such publication may be delayed such that any 
issues of patent protection may be addressed.  In the absence of any such 
request, upon expiration of the applicable period referred to in this 
Section 11.4 the publishing Party shall be free to proceed with the 
publication or presentation.  If the other Party requests reasonable 
modifications to the publication to prevent disclosure of trade secret, 
Proprietary Information or proprietary business information prior to 
submission of the publication or presentation, the publishing Party shall 
so edit such publication.  The contribution of each Party, if any, shall be 
noted in all publications or presentations by acknowledgment or 
co-authorship, whichever is appropriate.
 
11.5                        Other Public Statements.  Except as set forth 
in this Agreement or as required by Law, neither Party shall make any press 
release or other public announcement or other disclosure to a Third Party 
concerning the existence of or terms of this Agreement or relating to 
Products without the prior written consent of the other Party, which 
consent shall include agreement upon the nature and text of such 
announcement or disclosure and shall not be unreasonably withheld.  Each 
Party agrees to provide to the other Party a copy of any public

prior to its scheduled release.  Each Party shall have the right to 
expeditiously (but in any event within forty-eight (48) hours of receipt) 
review and recommend changes to any press release or announcement regarding 
this Agreement or the subject matter of this Agreement; provided, however 
that such right of review and recommendation shall only apply for the first 
time that specific information is to be disclosed, and shall not apply to 
the subsequent disclosure of substantially similar information that has 
previously been disclosed unless there have been material developments 
relating to Products since the date of the previous disclosure.
 
11.6                        No Rights to Use Name of Other Party.  Except 
as provided herein, neither Party shall use the name, trademark, trade name

    (as used in this Article 12, the Breaching Party) has materially
    breached or defaulted in the performance of any of its material
    obligations hereunder, and has not cured such breach within (i) thirty
    (30) days after notice of such breach is provided by the non-breaching
    Party to the Breaching Party, in case such breach is a non-payment of
    any amount due under this Agreement (which shall be deemed a material
    breach of a material obligation) and (ii) sixty (60) days (or, if such
    breach cannot be cured within such sixty (60) day period, if the
    Breaching Party does not commence and diligently continue actions to
    cure such breach during such sixty (60) day period) after notice of
    such breach is provided by the non-breaching Party to the Breaching
    Party for other cases of breach.  The termination shall become
    effective at the end of the (x) thirty (30) day period in case the
    breach is a non-payment of any amount due under this Agreement if the
    Breaching Party has not cured such breach during such thirty (30) day
    period, or (y) sixty (60) day period for other cases of breach unless
    (A) the Breaching Party cures such breach during such sixty (60) day
    period, or (B) if such breach is not susceptible to cure within such
    sixty (60) day period, the Breaching Party has commenced and is
    diligently pursuing a cure (unless such breach is not a willful breach
    and, by its nature, is incurable, in which case the Agreement may not
    be terminated unless the Breaching Party fails use its best

    (i)                                     on thirty (30) days written
    notice to Braeburn, if Braeburn, following Launch, discontinues
    commercial sale of Product for a period of three (3) months or more for
    reasons unrelated to Force Majeure, regulatory or safety issues or
    manufacturing or Product quality issues and subsequently fails to
    resume sales of a Product within thirty (30) days of having been
    notified in writing of such failure by Titan; or
 
    (ii)                                  upon written notice to Braeburn

    set forth in such notice.
 
(c)                                  Braeburn may, without prejudice to any 
other remedies available to it under this Agreement or at Law or in equity:
 
    (i)                                     terminate this Agreement
    immediately upon written notice to Titan, in the event that Braeburn is

    enter into an agreement with the Celanese Corporation or another
    available commercial supplier for supply of pharmaceutical grade EVA to
    Braeburn (each, a EVA Supplier).  If an EVA Supplier does enter into
    an agreement to supply EVA to Braeburn (an EVA Supply Agreement),
    Braeburn may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice
    to Titan in the event that Braeburn terminates such an EVA Supply
    Agreement due to a material breach by the EVA Supplier, or the EVA
    Supplier otherwise fails to provide EVA to Braeburn in accordance with
    the terms of such EVA Supply Agreement for a period of at least three
    (3) months;
 
    (ii)                                  in the event (A) Titan receives
    from the FDA a complete response letter advising that the Product NDA
    as filed by Titan for the Initial Indication will not be approved and
    that additional clinical studies and/or other development will be
    required to be performed prior to receipt of Regulatory Approval of
    Product for the Initial Indication (Additional Registration Studies)

    Studies would materially adversely impact the timing or cost required
    to be incurred by Braeburn for such Regulatory Approval such that
    Braeburn reasonably believes in good faith either (x) that that the NDA

    time, on a country-by-country basis, upon six (6) months prior written
    notice to Titan, following the first occurrence of any Significant
    Competition in such country, as defined in the next sentence.  
    Significant Competition shall be deemed to exist if, after the
    introduction in such country of a pharmaceutical product approved by
    the FDA as a generic drug referenced to Product, for use as a subdermal
    delivery of buprenorphine, for the treatment of opioid dependence or
    chronic pain, for a period of three (3) months or longer following a

    market, distribute, offer to sell, sell or otherwise dispose of or
    offer to dispose of the Compound, Product or any Licensed Products in
    the Territory as a result of an actual or perceived serious safety
    issue regarding the Compound, Product or any Licensed Products.
 
12.3                        Rights Not Affected.  All rights and licenses 
granted pursuant to this Agreement are, and shall otherwise be deemed to 
be, for purposes of Section 365(n) of the Bankruptcy Code licenses of 
rights to intellectual property as defined under Section 101(35A) of the 
Bankruptcy Code.  The Parties agree that Braeburn and Titan shall retain

elections under the Bankruptcy Code.  The Parties further agree that, in 
the event of the commencement of a bankruptcy or reorganization case by or 
against a Party under the Bankruptcy Code, the other Party shall be 
entitled to all applicable rights under Section 365 (including 365(n)) of 
the Bankruptcy Code.  Upon rejection of this Agreement by Titan or a 
trustee in bankruptcy for Titan, pursuant to Section 365(n) Braeburn may 
elect (a) to treat this Agreement as terminated by such rejection or (b) to 
retain its rights (including any right to enforce any exclusivity provision 
of this Agreement, but excluding any other right under non-bankruptcy law 
to specific performance of this Agreement) to intellectual property

its rights hereunder, then upon Braeburns written request to the trustee 
in bankruptcy or to Titan, the trustee or Titan, as applicable, shall (i) 
provide to Braeburn any intellectual property (including any embodiment of 
such intellectual property) held by the trustee or Titan and shall provide

Braeburn shall transfer to Titan ownership of, and assign to Titan all of 
its right, title and interest in and to, the Product NDA and any regulatory

hereunder, Braeburn and its Affiliates shall have the right to sell or 
otherwise dispose of the stock of any Product or Licensed Product, if 
applicable, subject to this Agreement on hand at the time of such 
termination or in process of manufacture; provided, however, that, at 
Titans request, Braeburn shall return to Titan any Product or Licensed 
Product that has not been sold or used within six (6) months following such 
termination and Titan shall reimburse Braeburns procurement costs related 
to such Product or Licensed Product, respectively, to the extent such costs 
have been previously been paid by Braeburn to Titan.
 
(b)                                 By Braeburn.  In the event of

defend and hold harmless to the fullest extent permitted by Law the 
Braeburn Indemnified Parties from and against from and against any and all 
Losses incurred by any of them in connection with any and all Third Party 
Claims in connection with, arising from or occurring as a result of:  (a) 
the breach by Titan of any of its obligations under this Agreement; (b) the 
breach or inaccuracy in any material respect of any representation or 
warranty made by Titan in this Agreement; (c) any claim or assertion that 
any representative or other person who is employed by Titan is an employee 
of Braeburn; (d) the manufacturing, use, marketing, sale, promotion, 
packaging, labeling, storage or distribution of Licensed Products in the 
Titan Territory by Titan, its Affiliates or any of its or their respective 
licensees or distributors, including any death, personal injury or other 
product liability arising out of or related to the Licensed Products; (e) 
the negligence, recklessness or willful misconduct of any Titan Indemnified 
Party in performing any activities in connection with this Agreement; or 
(f) any claim by any upstream licensor of Titan, in each case except for 
those Losses for which Braeburn has an obligation to indemnify any Titan 
Indemnified Parties pursuant to Section 13.2, as to which Losses each Party 
shall indemnify each of the Braeburn Indemnified Parties or Titan 
Indemnified Parties, as applicable, for the applicable Losses to the extent

underlying the applicable Third Party Claim.

the provision of notice pursuant to this section, the indemnified Party 
shall provide to the other Party copies of any complaint, summons, 
praecipe, subpoena or other court filings or correspondence related to such 
Claim and will give such other information with respect thereto as the 
other Party shall reasonably request.  The indemnifying Party and 
indemnified Party shall meet to discuss how to respond to such Claim.  
Failure to provide prompt notice shall not relieve any Party of the duty to 
defend or indemnify except to the extent such failure materially prejudices 
the defense of any matter.  Each Party agrees that it will take reasonable 
steps to minimize the burdens of the litigation on witnesses and on the 
ongoing business of the indemnified Parties, including making reasonable 
accommodations to witnesses schedules when possible and seeking 
appropriate protective orders limiting the duration and/or location of 
depositions.  The indemnified Party shall have the

Manufacturers, (ii) Titan has commenced discussions with, but not yet 
entered into Third Party Supply Agreements with any Third Party 
Manufacturers for commercial supply, and (iii) Titan Controls certain 
Know-How relating to the Product manufacturing process.  Accordingly,

Braeburn shall retain Titan to provide, and Titan (or its designees) hereby

and assistance relating to Processing Activities, including services 
associated with facilitating Braeburns contracting with and qualifying 
Third Party Manufacturers, and assisting in transferring to Braeburn 
technical information, regulatory information and other information and 
materials Controlled by Titan and reasonably necessary for Braeburn to 
assume Processing Activities, including reasonable time to consult with 
Titans technical personnel with respect to Processing Activities during 
normal business hours, as mutually agreed to upon reasonable notice (
Transition Supply Services).  During the Transition Services Period, the 
Parties shall use reasonable efforts to coordinate and cooperate with each 
other in negotiation and implementation of Third Party Supply Agreements 
with Third Party Manufacturers in their respective territories in order to 
take advantage of benefits that may be associated with volume discounts, 
economies of scale or similar provisions in connection with obligations 
that may be incurred by each Party under such Third Party Supply 
Agreements.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Titan shall not be required to 
hire additional personnel, engage additional Third-Party providers or 
procure additional equipment or technology to provide the Transition Supply 
Services, and Titans obligation to provide Transition Supply Services is 
subject to the continued availability of the personnel, subcontractors,

Effective Date) relating to the manufacturing, supply and/or inventory of 
any Compound, Product or Licensed Product that is held for the account of 
or delivered to Braeburn or Braeburns designee.  In addition, upon 
expiration of the Transition Services Period, Braeburn shall have the 
option, in Braeburns sole discretion, to purchase from Titan all Compound, 
EVA or Product (including validation batches) held in inventory as of such 
date at any Third Party Manufacturer, warehouse or distributor at a price 
equal to Titans Product Procurement Cost.  For clarity, in no event shall 
a charge based on the same inventory be required to be paid more than once. 
 All payments for Transition Supply Services shall be due within thirty 
(30) days after Titans invoice is provided to Braeburn for the associated 
Transition Supply Services.
 
14.3                        Performance Standards.  Subject to Braeburns 
compliance with the terms and conditions of Section 5.4(b) in all material 
respects, Titan covenants and agrees that it shall use Commercially 
Reasonable Efforts to provide the Transition Supply Services specified in 
Article 14 of this Agreement (a) at substantially the same level of

prior to the Effective Date and (b) in a time frame consistent in all 
material respects with Titans past practice.

15.1                        Disputes.  The Parties recognize that disputes 
as to certain matters may from time to time arise during the Agreement Term 
which relate to either Partys rights and/or obligations hereunder.  It is 
the objective of the Parties to establish procedures to facilitate the 
resolution of disputes arising under this Agreement in an expedient manner 
by mutual cooperation and without resort to litigation.  To accomplish this

Article 15 to resolve any controversy or claim arising out of, relating to 
or in connection with any provision of this Agreement, if and when a 
dispute arises under this Agreement.
 
15.2                        Internal Resolution.  With respect to all 
disputes arising between the Parties under this Agreement, if the Parties 
are unable to resolve such dispute within thirty (30) days after such 
dispute is first identified by either Party in writing to the other, the 
Parties shall refer such dispute to the Chief Executive Officers of the 
Parties for attempted resolution by good faith negotiations within thirty 
(30) days after such notice is received.  If the Chief Executive Officers 
of the Parties cannot resolve the dispute within thirty (30) days after 
such notice is received, such dispute shall be resolved in accordance with 
the terms of Section 16.6 hereof.
 
15.3                        Equitable Relief.  Notwithstanding the 
foregoing provisions of this Article 15, either Party may bring an action

liable or responsible to the other Party nor be deemed to have defaulted 
under or breached the Agreement for failure or delay in fulfilling or 
performing any term of the Agreement during the period of time when such 
failure or delay is caused by or results from a Force Majeure event or act, 
omission or delay in acting by the other Party.  The affected Party shall 
notify the other Party of such Force Majeure circumstances as soon as 
reasonably practicable.  Any suspension of performance shall be of no 
greater scope and of no longer duration than is reasonably required and the 
Force Majeure Party shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to remedy its 
inability to perform.
 
16.2                        Assignment.  This Agreement may not be assigned 
or otherwise transferred without the prior written consent of the other 
Party; provided, however, that:

its business or all or substantially all of its assets or in the event of a 
merger, consolidation, change in control or similar corporate transaction 
(any of the foregoing, a Corporate Transaction), without such consent; 
provided, however, that in the event of a Corporate Transaction prior to 
the NDA Transfer Date, and subject to Braeburns compliance with the terms 
and conditions of Section 5.4(b) in all material respects, Titan shall use 
Commercially Reasonable Efforts to retain and continue the availability of 
the Key Employees or other personnel with experience and expertise in the 
pharmaceutical industry reasonably equivalent to that of the Key Employees 
as they relate to obtaining FDA Approval for the Initial Indication and 
preparing and submitting the Product NDA.

December 14, 2012 between Titan Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Titan) and 
Braeburn Pharmaceuticals Sprl (Braeburn) (each a Party and collectively 
Parties), as amended by written agreement dated May 28, 2013 (the First 
Amendment) (together the Original License and First Amendment constitute 
the Agreement).  This is to confirm our agreement as follows:
 
1.                                      Section 4.1 of the Agreement is 
hereby amended to add the following clause (c):
 
    (c)                            The Parties hereby establish a
    committee (the CRL Response Committee) comprised of Marc Rubin and
    Sunil Bhonsle (the Titan Representatives) and Seth Harrison, Garry
    Neil and a third individual to be named by Braeburn (the Braeburn
    Representatives).  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, including
    the provisions of Section 4.2(a), the CRL Response Committee shall be
    responsible for and have the authority to make all decisions regarding
    the development and implementation of a strategic plan for FDA approval
    of Probuphine for subdermal use in the maintenance treatment of adult
    patients with opioid dependence, including, but not limited to
    developing the strategy for all written and oral communications with
    the FDA and responding to any complete response letter (CRL) issued
    by the FDA (the Project).  The CRL Response Committee shall operate
    as follows:
 
    1.1                               The CRL Response Committee shall meet
    in person or by conference telephone call twice monthly on a regularly
    scheduled basis on dates mutually agreeable to all members, except that
    individual meetings may be cancelled where mutually agreeable to both
    Braeburn and Titan.  Additional meetings may be called by any member
    with at least 48 hours notice (unless such notice requirement is
    waived by all members) at a time mutually agreeable to all members,
    provided that the member calling for the meeting has provided a
    reasonably sufficient rationale for the need for a meeting, and that
    the stated need for the meeting cannot be sufficiently addressed at the
    next regularly scheduled meeting of the CRL Response Committee or
    through more informal communications.
 
    1.2                               Drafts of written communications to

    shall be provided contemporaneously to all of the committee members. 
    Any comments from the Titan Representatives and the Braeburn
    Representatives will be considered in good faith.
 
    1.3                               The CRL Response Committee may
    designate, on a case -by -case basis, one or more representatives of
    the Parties, including consultants or agents of Titan and Braeburn, to
    attend telephonic or in-person meetings with the FDA, which designee(s)
    shall be in addition to the Parties respective representatives for
    such meetings pursuant to Section 4.2(xii) below.
 
    1.4                               The Titan Representatives and the
    Braeburn Representatives shall seek to reach consensus regarding the
    Project after due consideration of advice from Braeburns regulatory
    advisors and other outside consultants, as appropriate.  However, in
    the event the Parties cannot agree, the Braeburn Representatives shall
    have final decision-making authority regarding all Project matters
    considered by the CRL Response Committee.
 
    1.5                               The CRL Response Committee shall be
    automatically disbanded upon the NDA Transfer Date.
 
    2.              Section 4.2(a) of the Agreement is hereby amended by
    adding the following new clauses (xi) through (xiii):
 
      (xi)                                                Notwithstanding
      the foregoing provisions of this Section 4.2(a), Titan shall
      authorize Braeburn to designate a person or persons who shall serve
      as the primary contact with the FDA with respect to the Project.  The
      initial designee of Braeburn is its Head of Research and Development,
      Garry Neil.  Braeburn shall, with the guidance of regulatory counsel,
      at the direction of the CRL Response Committee, determine when and
      how to meet with the FDA, and who should attend such meetings in
      order to obtain the desired outcome.
 
      (xii)                                                   Braeburn
      shall provide advance notice to Titan of any scheduled meetings, and
      substantive discussions or other communications with the FDA
      regarding the Project.  Each of the Parties shall be entitled to have
      at least one representative selected by it present at such meetings
      with FDA, whether in person or by conference telephone call. 
      Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, the CRL Response
      Committee may determine in good faith that certain interactions with
      the FDA can reasonably be expected to produce the best outcome
      without representatives of either Braeburn or Titan, or with outside
      consultants and without representatives of both Braeburn and Titan.
 
      (xiii)                                                Any written
      communications from the FDA to Braeburn shall be provided to Titan on
      the same day as receipt.  Any substantive oral communications from
      the FDA to Braeburn shall be conveyed to Titan Representatives as
      soon as possible, but in no event later than 48 hours following
      receipt.

  Approval has been obtained in such jurisdiction, (B) Section 6.4 (Reports

  ending on the NDA Transfer Date, Braeburn shall be solely responsible for

  After the NDA Transfer Date, Braeburn will be solely responsible for all

Reference is made to the License Agreement (the Original License) dated 
December 14, 2012 between Titan Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Titan) and 
Braeburn Pharmaceuticals Sprl (Braeburn) (each a Party and collectively 
Parties), as amended by written agreement dated May 28, 2013 (the First 
Amendment) (together the Original License and First Amendment constitute 
the Agreement).  This is to confirm our agreement as follows:
 
1.                                      Section 4.1 of the Agreement is 
hereby amended to add the following clause (c):
 
    (c)                            The Parties hereby establish a
    committee (the CRL Response Committee) comprised of Marc Rubin and
    Sunil Bhonsle (the Titan Representatives) and Seth Harrison, Garry
    Neil and a third individual to be named by Braeburn (the Braeburn

    responsible for and have the authority to make all decisions regarding
    the development and implementation of a strategic plan for FDA approval
    of Probuphine for subdermal use in the maintenance treatment of adult
    patients with opioid dependence, including, but not limited to
    developing the strategy for all written and oral communications with
    the FDA and responding to any complete response letter (CRL) issued
    by the FDA (the Project).  The CRL Response Committee shall operate
    as follows:
 
    1.1                               The CRL Response Committee shall meet
    in person or by conference telephone call twice monthly on a regularly
    scheduled basis on dates mutually agreeable to all members, except that
    individual meetings may be cancelled where mutually agreeable to both
    Braeburn and Titan.  Additional meetings may be called by any member
    with at least 48 hours notice (unless such notice requirement is
    waived by all members) at a time mutually agreeable to all members,
    provided that the member calling for the meeting has provided a
    reasonably sufficient rationale for the need for a meeting, and that
    the stated need for the meeting cannot be sufficiently addressed at the
    next regularly scheduled meeting of the CRL Response Committee or
    through more informal communications.
 
    1.2                               Drafts of written communications to

    shall be provided contemporaneously to all of the committee members. 
    Any comments from the Titan Representatives and the Braeburn
    Representatives will be considered in good faith.
 
    1.3                               The CRL Response Committee may
    designate, on a case -by -case basis, one or more representatives of
    the Parties, including consultants or agents of Titan and Braeburn, to
    attend telephonic or in-person meetings with the FDA, which designee(s)
    shall be in addition to the Parties respective representatives for

    Braeburn Representatives shall seek to reach consensus regarding the
    Project after due consideration of advice from Braeburns regulatory
    advisors and other outside consultants, as appropriate.  However, in
    the event the Parties cannot agree, the Braeburn Representatives shall

    automatically disbanded upon the NDA Transfer Date.
 
    2.              Section 4.2(a) of the Agreement is hereby amended by
    adding the following new clauses (xi) through (xiii):
 
      (xi)                                                Notwithstanding
      the foregoing provisions of this Section 4.2(a), Titan shall
      authorize Braeburn to designate a person or persons who shall serve
      as the primary contact with the FDA with respect to the Project.  The
      initial designee of Braeburn is its Head of Research and Development,
      Garry Neil.  Braeburn shall, with the guidance of regulatory counsel,
      at the direction of the CRL Response Committee, determine when and
      how to meet with the FDA, and who should attend such meetings in
      order to obtain the desired outcome.
 
      (xii)                                                   Braeburn
      shall provide advance notice to Titan of any scheduled meetings, and
      substantive discussions or other communications with the FDA
      regarding the Project.  Each of the Parties shall be entitled to have
      at least one representative selected by it present at such meetings
      with FDA, whether in person or by conference telephone call. 
      Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, the CRL Response
      Committee may determine in good faith that certain interactions with
      the FDA can reasonably be expected to produce the best outcome
      without representatives of either Braeburn or Titan, or with outside
      consultants and without representatives of both Braeburn and Titan.
 
      (xiii)                                                Any written
      communications from the FDA to Braeburn shall be provided to Titan on
      the same day as receipt.  Any substantive oral communications from
      the FDA to Braeburn shall be conveyed to Titan Representatives as
      soon as possible, but in no event later than 48 hours following
      receipt.

  (b)                                 Notwithstanding the above, on a
  country-by-country basis, upon the occurrence of any Competition, the

  irrevocably elect to (x) reduce the Royalty rate provided for in Section
  6.2(a)(i) from [***] percent ([***]%) to [***] percent
