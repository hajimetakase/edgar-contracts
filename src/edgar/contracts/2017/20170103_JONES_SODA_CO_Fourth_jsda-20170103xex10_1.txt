       Certifications attached hereto as Exhibit A and incorporated herein
       by this reference remains in full force and effect and no change in
       Borrower’s officers or signing authority has occurred.

       3. Effective Date.  The terms of this Modification shall be in full
       force and effect as of December 27, 2016.

       4. Modification to Agreement.  The Agreement is hereby modified as
       follows:

       a. The following Section(s) is(are) hereby amended and restated in
       its(their) entirety as set forth below:

       6.Advances hereunder shall bear interest, on the average daily
       outstanding balance, at the rate (the “Rate”) of three quarters of
       one percent  (0.75%) per annum (in the case of Advances against the
       Domestic A/R Borrowing Base or the Canadian A/R Borrowing Base), and 
       three quarters of one percent  (0.75%) per annum (in the case of
       Advances against the Inventory Borrowing Base) over and above the
       rate announced as the “prime” rate in the Western Edition of the
       Wall Street Journal which is in effect from time to time (the “Prime
       Rate”); provided that the Prime Rate shall at all times be deemed to
       be not less than zero percent (0.00%) per annum (the “Deemed Prime
       Rate”) and provided that the cumulative minimum annual amount of
       interest payable together with the Administrative Fee (as defined in
       Paragraph 9) shall in no event be less than Thirty Thousand and
       00/100 Dollars ($30,000.00)  annually (the “Cumulative Minimum
       Annual Interest Payment”) and, (i) in the event that accrued
       interest together with the Administrative Fee (collectively,
       “Accrued Interest”) is less than $2,500 during any month of such
       annual period (commencing January 2015) (for any applicable month, a
       “Shortfall”), Borrower shall pay such Accrued Interest together with
       the Shortfall amount for such month, and, (ii) if the aggregate
       Accrued Interest and Shortfall payments exceed the Cumulative
       Minimum Annual Interest Payment at any time during such applicable
       annual period, Borrower shall not be required to make any further
       Shortfall payments during such annual

       period and shall only be required to make a payment of any such
       Accrued Interest during the month that it accrues.  In the event
       that the Prime Rate is changed, the adjustment in the Rate charged
       shall be made on the day such change occurs.  Interest shall be
       computed on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual number of
       days elapsed.  Interest shall be due and payable monthly on the
       first day of each month, and if not so paid, shall bear interest at
       the Rate.  Borrower hereby instructs and authorizes Lender (until
       such time as such instructions are revoked in writing) to charge
       accrued interest as an Advance under this Agreement. 
       Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained

       9. (b)Administrative Fee - While any indebtedness remains
       outstanding pursuant to this Agreement, on or before the first day
       of each month, Borrower agrees to pay an administrative fee equal to 
       one tenth of one percent (0.10%) per month of the average daily
       outstanding balance during the preceding month (the “Administrative
       Fee”).  For purposes of computing the average daily outstanding
       balance during the month and the Administrative Fee payable on
       account thereof, payments shall be applied as set forth in
       Paragraphs 5 and 6 above.

       5. Fee.  On the effective date of the Modification, Borrower agrees
       to pay a fee in the amount of Twenty-Three Thousand Eight Hundred
       Twelve and 50/100 Dollars ($23,812.50) which sum represents the 
       loan fee due.

       6. Legal Effect.  Except as specifically set forth in this
       Modification, all of the terms and conditions of the Agreement
       remain in full force and effect.

       7. Counterparts.  This Modification may be executed in any number of
       counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of
       which taken together shall constitute a single original.

       8. Electronic Signature.  This Modification, or a signature page
       thereto intended to be attached to a copy of this Modification,
       signed and transmitted by facsimile machine, telecopier or other
       electronic means (including via transmittal of a “pdf” file) shall
       be deemed and treated as an original document.  The signature of any
       person thereon, for purposes hereof, is to be considered as an
       original signature, and the document transmitted is to be considered
       to have the same binding effect as an original signature on an
       original document.  At the request of any party hereto, any
       facsimile, telecopy or other electronic document is to be
       re-executed in original form by the persons who executed the
       facsimile, telecopy of other electronic document.  No party hereto
       may raise the use of a facsimile machine, telecopier or other
       electronic means or the fact that any signature was transmitted
       through the use of a facsimile machine, telecopier or other
       electronic means as a defense to the enforcement of this 
       Modification.

       9. Integration.  This is an integrated Modification and supersedes
       all prior negotiations and agreements regarding the subject matter
       hereof.  All amendments hereto must be in writing and signed by the
       parties.

       IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Fourth 
       Modification to Loan and Security Agreement as of the date first set
       forth above.
