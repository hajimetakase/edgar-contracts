      such individual whose initial assumption of office occurs as a result
      of an actual or threatened election contest with respect to the

      resulting from such Business Combination (including, without
      limitation, an entity which as a result of such transaction owns the
      Corporation or all or substantially all of the Corporation’s assets
      either directly or through one or more subsidiaries) in substantially
      the same proportions relative to each other as their ownership,
      immediately prior to such Business Combination, of the Corporation
      Common Stock and Voting Stock of the Corporation, as the case may be,
      (B) no Person (excluding any entity resulting from such Business
      Combination or any employee benefit plan (or related trust) sponsored
      or maintained by the Corporation or such entity resulting from such
      Business Combination) beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 15%
      or more of, respectively, the then-outstanding shares of common stock
      of the entity resulting from such Business Combination, or the

      (i)a change in the Participant’s principal location of employment
      that is greater than fifty (50) miles from its location as of the
      date hereof without the Participant’s consent; provided, however,
      that the Participant hereby acknowledges that the Participant may be
      required to engage in travel in connection with the performance of
      the Participant’s duties hereunder and that such travel shall not
      constitute a change in the Participant’s principal location of

      (ii)a material diminution in the Participant’s base compensation;
      (iii)a change in the Participant’s position with the Corporation

      responsibilities; or
      (iv)any other action or inaction that constitutes a material breach
      by the Corporation of the agreement under which the Participant
      provides services.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Participant’s termination of the 
Participant’s employment with the Corporation as a result of the occurrence 
of any of the foregoing shall not constitute a “Termination For Good Cause” 
unless (A) the Participant gives the Corporation written notice of such 
occurrence within ninety (90) days of such occurrence and such occurrence 
is not cured by the Corporation within thirty (30) days of the date on 
which such written notice is received by the Corporation and (B)



------------------------------------------------------------------------


the Participant actually terminates his or her employment with the 
Corporation prior to the three hundred sixty-fifth (365th) day following 
such occurrence.

      (i)Capitalized terms used herein without definition shall have the
      meanings assigned to them in the Plan.
2.Management Objectives.
The Management Objectives for the Performance Period covered by this 
Agreement and the potential Performance Shares that may be earned with 
respect to the Management Objectives are set forth on Exhibit A. In no 
event shall the Participant be entitled to receive more than [_____] of the 
Performance Shares granted hereunder.

      3.Grant of Performance Shares.
The Corporation hereby grants to the Participant the number of Performance 
Shares specified above, which may be earned by the Participant during the 
Performance Period as set forth in Section 4 of this Agreement.

      4.Earned Shares.
(a)General.
      (i)The Performance Shares granted hereby shall be earned based on the
      level of the Corporation’s results with respect to the Management
      Objectives established for the Performance Period covered by this
      Agreement.
      (ii)The number of Performance Shares earned shall be determined based
      on the level of results of the Management Objectives. No additional
      Performance Shares shall be earned for results in excess of the
      maximum level of results for the Management Objectives.
      (iii)The level of achievement with respect to the Management
      Objectives will be assessed by the Committee as of each Interim
      Measurement Date and as of the Final Measurement Date, in each case
      as soon as practicable following the receipt of audited financial
      statements relating to the fiscal year ended as of such Measurement
      Date. There will not be interpolation of performance achievement or
      payout as of any Interim Measurement Date; however, at the Final
      Measurement Date, if results for Synergy Savings are attained at an
      interim level of performance, a proportionate number of Performance
      Shares shall be earned, as determined by mathematical interpolation.
(b)Interim Measurement Dates. As of any Interim Measurement Date:
      (i)if the Synergy Savings achieved to date are below the Target level
      of performance, then (i) none of the potential Performance Shares
      granted hereby will be earned as


------------------------------------------------------------------------


      of such Interim Measurement Date, and (ii) performance shall be
      assessed as of the next Measurement Date; and
      (ii)if the Synergy Savings achieved to date are at or above the
      Target level of performance, then (i) 50% of the potential
      Performance Shares granted hereby shall be earned at the Target level
      as of such Interim Measurement Date and paid out following such
      Interim Measurement Date in accordance with Section 5, and (ii)
      performance shall be assessed as of the Final Measurement Date with
      respect to the remaining potential Performance Shares. For the
      avoidance of doubt, if any Performance Shares are earned as of and
      paid out following the December 31, 2017 Interim Measurement Date
      pursuant to this Section 4(b)(ii), no additional potential
      Performance Shares shall be earned as of the December 31, 2018
      Interim Measurement Date.
(c)Final Measurement Date. The final number of Performance Shares earned 
and to be paid out following the Final Measurement Date with respect to 
this Agreement, if any, shall be the number of Performance Shares earned at 
the level of cumulative Synergy Savings for the Performance Period per 
Exhibit A, with amounts interpolated as provided in Section 4(a)(iii), 
reduced by such number of Performance Shares, if any, that were earned as 
of and paid out following the Interim Measurement Dates.
5.Payment of Awards.
Payment shall be made in the form of the Corporation’s Common Shares. 
Amounts earned as of a Measurement Date shall be paid, less applicable 
taxes, as soon as practicable after the determination by the Committee of 
the level of attainment of the Management Objectives as of such Measurement 
Date, (but in all events by the last day of the fiscal year following such 
Measurement Date); provided, however, that in the event that Performance 
Shares become nonforfeitable pursuant to Section 6, the Performance Shares 
(except as otherwise required under Section 13) shall be payable within 30 
days of becoming nonforfeitable.

Any payment of awards due pursuant to this Agreement to a deceased 
Participant shall be paid to the beneficiary designated by the Participant 
by the latest Designation of Death Beneficiary in the form attached as 
Exhibit B hereto filed by the Participant with the Corporation. If no such 
beneficiary has been designated or survives the Participant, payment shall 
be made to the Participant’s legal representative. A beneficiary 
designation may be changed or revoked by a Participant at any time, 
provided the change or revocation is filed with the Corporation.

Prior to payment, the Corporation shall only have an unfunded and unsecured 
obligation to make payment of earned awards to the Participant.



------------------------------------------------------------------------


      6.Effect of Change in Control.
In the event of a Change in Control after the Grant Date but prior to the 
end of the Performance Period, the Participant shall be deemed to have 
earned 100% of the Performance Shares granted hereunder as of the date of 
the Change in Control, and such earned Performance Shares, less such number 
of Performance Shares, if any, that were earned as of and paid out 
following an Interim Measurement Date(s) prior to such Change in Control, 
shall be payable in the form of Common Shares. The Performance Shares 
earned under this Section 6 shall be paid to the Participant as soon as 
practicable following the end of the Performance Period, but in all events 
by the last day of the fiscal year following the last fiscal year of the 
Performance Period, only if the Participant remains employed by the 
Corporation or a Subsidiary as of the end of the Performance Period, 
otherwise such earned Performance Shares shall be forfeited; provided, 
that if, prior to the end of the Performance Period, the Participant’s 
employment with the Corporation or a Subsidiary is terminated by the 
Participant as a “Termination for Good Cause,” the Participant is 
terminated by the Corporation other than as a “Termination for Cause,” or 
the Participant’s employment with the Corporation or a Subsidiary 
terminates under the circumstances set forth in Section 7(a) through 7(b) 
hereof, then the Performance Shares earned under this Section 6 shall 
become immediately nonforfeitable upon such termination. Notwithstanding 
anything in this Section 6 to the contrary, in connection with a Business 
Combination the result of which is that the Corporation Common Stock and 
Voting Stock is exchanged for or becomes exchangeable for securities of 
another entity, cash or a combination thereof, if the entity resulting from 
such Business Combination does not assume the Performance Shares evidenced 
hereby and the Corporation’s obligations hereunder, or replace the 
Performance Shares evidenced hereby with a substantially equivalent 
security of the entity resulting from such Business Combination, then the 
Performance Shares evidenced hereby shall become immediately nonforfeitable 
as of immediately prior to such Business Combination, if not previously 
earned as of and paid following an Interim Measurement Date(s).

      7.Effect of Death or Disability.
If the Participant’s employment with the Corporation or one of its 
Subsidiaries should terminate under the circumstances set forth in Section 
7(a) through 7(b) below, prior to the payment of an award, the extent to 
which the Performance Shares granted hereby shall be deemed to have been 
earned shall be determined as if the Participant’s employment had not 
terminated and the result shall be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator 
of which is the number of full months the Participant was employed during 
the Performance Period and the denominator of which is the total number of 
months in the Performance Period; provided, however, the Board, upon the 
recommendation of the Committee, may, in its discretion, increase payments 
made under the foregoing circumstances up to the full amount payable for 
service throughout the Performance Period; and provided, further, that the 
amount of Performance Shares, if any,



------------------------------------------------------------------------


earned under this Section 7 shall be reduced by such number of Performance 
Shares, if any, that were earned as of and paid out following an Interim 
Measurement Date(s) prior to such death or disability:

      (a)because of death; or
(b)because of permanent disability.
Performance Shares payable pursuant to this Section 7 shall be paid in 
accordance with Section 5.

      8.Effect of Other Terminations of Employment; Detrimental Activity.
In the event that the Participant’s employment shall terminate prior to the 
payment of an award in a manner other than any specified in Section 7 
hereof or if the Participant shall at any time engage in any Detrimental 
Activity (as defined below), the Participant shall forfeit any rights he or 
she may have in any Performance Shares that have not been paid out to the 
Participant prior to the time of such termination; provided, however, that 
the Board, upon recommendation of the Committee, may order payment of an 
award in an amount determined as in Section 7 hereof for termination for 
the reasons set forth in Section 7 hereof, under circumstances which 
warrant such exceptional treatment in the judgment of the Committee and the 
Board.

      9.Detrimental Activity.
If the Participant, either during employment by the Corporation or a 
Subsidiary or within one year after termination of such employment, shall 
engage in any Detrimental Activity, and the Board shall so find, and 
(except for any Detrimental Activity described in Section 9(d)(v)(B)) if 
the Participant shall not have ceased all Detrimental Activity within 30 
days after notice of such finding given within one year after commencement 
of such Detrimental Activity, the Participant shall:

      (a)Return to the Corporation all Performance Shares that the
      Participant has not disposed of and paid out pursuant to this
      Agreement within a period of one year prior to the date of the
      commencement of such Detrimental Activity, and
(b)With respect to any Performance Shares that the Participant has disposed 
of that were paid out pursuant to this Agreement within a period of one 
year prior to the date of the commencement of such Detrimental Activity, 
pay to the Corporation in cash the value of such Performance Shares on the 
date such Performance Shares were paid out.
(c)To the extent that the amounts referred to in Section 9(a) and 9(b) 
above are not paid to the Corporation, the Corporation may set off the 
amounts so payable to it against any amounts that may be owing from time to 
time by the Corporation or a Subsidiary to the Participant, whether as 
wages, deferred compensation or vacation pay or in the form of any other 
benefit or for any other reason.
(d)For purposes of this Agreement, the term “Detrimental Activity” shall 
include:


------------------------------------------------------------------------


      (i)Engaging in any activity, as an employee, principal, agent, or
      consultant for another entity, and in a capacity, that directly
      competes with the Corporation or any Subsidiary in any actual
      product, service or business activity (or in any product, service or
      business activity which was under active development while the
      Participant was employed by the Corporation if such development is
      being actively pursued by the Corporation during the one-year period
      first referred to in this Section 9) for which the Participant has
      had any direct responsibility and direct involvement during the last
      two years of his or her employment with the Corporation or a
      Subsidiary, in any territory in which the Corporation or a Subsidiary
      manufactures, sells, markets, services, or installs such product or
      service, or engages in such business activity.
      (ii)Soliciting any employee of the Corporation or a Subsidiary to
      terminate his or her employment with the Corporation or a Subsidiary.
      (iii)The disclosure to anyone outside the Corporation or a
      Subsidiary, or the use in other than the Corporation or a
      Subsidiary’s business, without prior written authorization from the
      Corporation, of any confidential, proprietary or trade secret
      information or material relating to the business of the Corporation
      and its Subsidiaries, acquired by the Participant during his or her
      employment with the Corporation or its Subsidiaries or while acting
      as a consultant for the Corporation or its Subsidiaries thereafter; 
      provided, however, that nothing in this Agreement limits a
      Participant’s ability to file a charge or complaint or to
      communicate, including by providing documents or other information
      without notice to the Corporation, with the Securities and Exchange
      Commission or any other governmental agency or commission
      (“Government Agency”) or limits a Participant’s right to receive an
      award for information provided to any Government Agency.
      (iv)The failure or refusal to disclose promptly and to assign to the
      Corporation upon request all right, title and interest in any
      invention or idea, patentable or not, made or conceived by the
      Participant during employment by the Corporation and any Subsidiary,
      relating in any manner to the actual or anticipated business,
      research or development work of the Corporation or any Subsidiary or
      the failure or refusal to do anything reasonably necessary to enable
      the Corporation or any Subsidiary to secure a patent where
      appropriate in the United States and in other countries.
      (v)Activity that results in Termination for Cause. For the purposes
      of this Section 9 and Section 6, “Termination for Cause” shall mean a
      termination:
            (A)due to the Participant’s willful and continuous gross
            neglect of his or her duties for which he or she is employed,
            or


------------------------------------------------------------------------


            (B)due to an act of dishonesty on the part of the Participant
            constituting a felony resulting or intended to result, directly
            or indirectly, in his or her gain for personal enrichment at
            the expense of the Corporation or a Subsidiary.
10.Shares Non-Transferable.
The Performance Shares granted hereby that have not yet been paid out are 
not transferable other than by will or the laws of descent and 
distribution.

      11.Dilution and Other Adjustments.
In the event of any change in the aggregate number of outstanding Common 
Shares by reason of any stock dividend or stock split, recapitalization, 
reclassification, merger, consolidation, combination or exchange of shares 
or other similar corporate change, the Committee shall adjust the 
Management Objectives and/or the number of Performance Shares then held by 
the Participant. Such adjustments made by the Committee shall be conclusive 
and binding for all purposes of this Agreement.

      12.Withholding Taxes.
To the extent that the Corporation is required to withhold federal, state, 
local or foreign taxes in connection with the delivery of Common Shares to 
the Participant or other person under this Agreement, and the amounts 
available to the Corporation for such withholding are insufficient, it 
shall be a condition to the receipt of such delivery that the Participant 
or such other person will make arrangements satisfactory to the Corporation 
for payment of the balance of such taxes required to be withheld, which 
arrangements (in the discretion of the Committee) may include 
relinquishment of a portion of such benefit. In no event, however, shall 
the Corporation accept Common Shares for payment of taxes in excess of 
required tax withholding rates, except that, in the discretion of the 
Committee, the Participant or such other person may surrender Common Shares 
owned for more than 6 months to satisfy any tax obligations resulting from 
any such transaction.

      13.Compliance with Section 409A of the Code.
To the extent applicable, it is intended that this Agreement and the Plan 
comply with the provisions of Section 409A of the Code, so that the income 
inclusion provisions of Section 409A(a)(1) do not apply to the Participant. 
This Agreement and the Plan shall be administered in a manner consistent 
with this intent, and any provision that would cause the Agreement or the 
Plan to fail to satisfy Section 409A of the Code shall have no force and 
effect until amended to comply with Section 409A of the Code (which 
amendment may be retroactive to the extent permitted by Section 409A of the 
Code and may be made by the Corporation without the consent of the 
Participant). In particular, to the extent the Performance Shares become 
nonforfeitable pursuant to Section 6 and payment at such time would subject 
the Participant to penalties under Section 409A of the Code, then 
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 5,



------------------------------------------------------------------------


payment will be made, to the extent necessary to comply with the provisions 
of Section 409A of the Code, to the Participant on the earlier of (a) the 
Participant’s “separation from service” with the Corporation (determined in 
accordance with Section 409A of the Code); provided, however, that if the 
Participant is a “specified employee” (within the meaning of Section 409A 
of the Code), the payment date shall be the date that is six months after 
the date of the Participant’s “separation of service” with the Corporation, 
(b) the date payment otherwise would have made under Section 5 above, or 
(c) the Participant’s death. Reference to Section 409A of the Code is to 
Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and will 
also include any proposed, temporary or final regulations, or any other 
guidance, promulgated with respect to such Section by the U.S. Department 
of the Treasury or the Internal Revenue Service.

      14.Employment Rights.
For purposes of this Agreement, the continuous employ of the Participant 
with the Corporation or a Subsidiary shall not be deemed interrupted, and 
the Participant shall not be deemed to have ceased to be an associate of 
the Corporation or any Subsidiary, by reason of the transfer of his or her 
employment among the Corporation and its Subsidiaries. This award is a 
voluntary, discretionary bonus being made on a one-time basis and it does 
not constitute a commitment to make any future awards. This award and any 
payments made hereunder will not be considered salary or other compensation 
for purposes of any severance pay or similar allowance, except as otherwise 
required by law. Nothing in this Agreement will give the Participant any 
right to continue employment with the Corporation or any Subsidiary, as the 
case may be, or interfere in any way with the right of the Corporation or a 
Subsidiary to terminate the employment of the Participant.

      15.Data Protection.
Information about the Participant and the Participant’s participation in 
the Plan may be collected, recorded and held, used and disclosed for any 
purpose related to the administration of the Plan. The Participant 
understands that such processing of this information may need to be carried 
out by the Corporation and its Subsidiaries and by third party 
administrators whether such persons are located within the Participant’s 
country or elsewhere, including the United States of America. The 
Participant consents to the processing of information relating to the 
Participant and the Participant’s participation in the Plan in any one or 
more of the ways referred to above.

      16.Amendments.
Any amendment to the Plan shall be deemed to be an amendment to this 
Agreement to the extent that the amendment is applicable hereto; provided, 
however, that no amendment shall adversely affect the rights of the 
Participant with respect to the Performance Shares without the 
Participant’s consent.



------------------------------------------------------------------------


      17.Plan and Capitalized Terms.
This Agreement is subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan. 
Capitalized terms used herein without definition shall have the meanings 
assigned to them in the Plan or on the Grant Detail Page (which is a part 
of this Agreement) as the context so requires.

      18.Validity.
If any provision of this Agreement or the application of any provision 
hereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid, unenforceable or 
otherwise illegal, the remainder of this Agreement and the application of 
such provision to any other person or under any circumstances shall not be 
affected, and the provisions so held to be invalid, unenforceable or 
otherwise illegal shall be reformed to the extent (and only to the extent) 
necessary to make it enforceable, valid and legal.

      19.Governing Law.
This Agreement is made under, and shall be construed in accordance with the 
internal substantive laws of the State of Ohio.
