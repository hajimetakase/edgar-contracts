this Section 2.3.  Any person or entity that receives a sublicense or is 
otherwise granted the right to promote and sell the Product as permitted 
hereunder is a Sublicensee.
 
2.4                               Right of First Negotiation.  Camurus 
hereby grants to Braeburn a right of first negotiation to expand the 
license in Section 2.1 to include countries within the Camurus Territory 
that are outside the EU (the ROFN Countries) on the terms and conditions 
set forth in this Section 2.4.
 
If Camurus has received a bona fide offer or proposal from a Third Party 
encompassing key financial and commercial terms, or otherwise has agreed on 
such principal terms with a Third Party, in either case to commercialize a 
Product in one or more of the ROFN Countries, then prior to Camurus 
granting rights to such Third Party to commercialize a Product in one or 
more of the ROFN Countries, Camurus shall give Braeburn prompt written 
notice thereof.  Braeburn shall have [***] after receipt of the notice to 
deliver a Notice of Exercise, covering all the ROFN Countries that are 
subject to the Third Party offer, to Camurus.  Upon Camurus receipt of a 
Notice of Exercise, the Parties shall enter into good faith negotiations 
regarding an amendment to this Agreement on commercially reasonable terms 
to include in the Licensed Territory the ROFN Countries specified in the 
Notice of Exercise.  If Braeburn has not delivered a Notice of Exercise 
within the [***] period, or the Parties are unable to reach agreement on an 
amendment to this Agreement within [***], then Braeburn shall have no 
further rights hereunder with respect to such ROFN Countries covered by the 
Third Party offer; provided, that if Camurus or one of its Affiliates do 
not execute a commercial agreement with a Third Party within [***] from the 
Notice of Exercise, then Braeburns rights with respect to the offered 
countries under this Section 2.4 shall reset.
 
2.5                               Option.  Camurus hereby grants Braeburn 
an exclusive option (the Option), which may be exercised during the 
Option Term, to include Japan, Taiwan, South Korea and China in the 
Licensed Territory.  Braeburn shall have the right to exercise the Option 
on a country-by-country and Product-by-Product basis by delivering a Notice 
of Exercise to Camurus during the Option Term.  The date when the Notice of 
Exercise is sent shall be the date of option exercise and the date when 
Braeburns rights in the countries set forth in the Notice of Exercise will 
take effect.  The countries for which the Option was exercised shall become 
part of the Licensed Territory and no longer be considered part of the 
Camurus Territory and all applicable diligence, governance, milestone, 
royalty and other terms and conditions of this Agreement shall apply to 
those countries; provided, that Braeburns right to sublicense under 
Sections 2.3(a) and 2.3(c) shall, with respect to China, require the 
consent of Camurus, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, 
conditioned or delayed.  Within [***] after the Notice of Exercise, 
Braeburn shall submit to the JSC an updated Development Plan and 
Commercialization Plan including the countries for which the Option was 
exercised.  With

respect to Japan it is anticipated that further Clinical Trials (in 
addition to the Phase III Clinical Trials covered by the Development Plan 
attached on the Effective Date) will be required to support a Japanese NDA 
application and, if so, Braeburn shall include in the applicable 
Development Plan such additional Clinical Trials required to support a 
Japanese NDA application.
 
2.6                               Co-Promotion.  Braeburn shall have the 
exclusive, nontransferable right for itself and its Affiliates, on a 
Product-by-Product basis, to co-promote the Product with Camurus, its 
Affiliates and licensees in the country of Belgium, pursuant to the terms 
of a separate agreement to be negotiated by the Parties, which agreement 
shall contain the terms set forth in Exhibit 2.6.  Camurus shall provide 
Braeburn with written notice within [***] after Camurus or its Affiliate or 
licensee has filed the NDA for a Product in Belgium.  Braeburn may exercise 
its right to co-promote by delivering a Notice of Exercise to Camurus no 
later than [***] after receipt of Camurus notice.
 
2.7                               Camurus Territory.  To the extent 
permitted under applicable law and except as otherwise permitted under this 
Agreement, Braeburn shall not directly or knowingly supply the Products to 
any Third Party located in any country in the Camurus Territory.  The 
foregoing restrictions shall apply for the duration of the applicable 
Royalty Term.
 
2.8                               Exclusivity.  For a period beginning on 
the Effective Date and ending on the [***] of the First Commercial Sale of 
the first Product, on a country-by-country basis (the Non-Compete Period
), Braeburn and Camurus and their respective Affiliates, as well as 
Braeburns Sublicensees (but with respect to Braeburns Sublicensees solely 
regarding the opioid dependence indication in the United States), shall not 
directly or indirectly promote, market, sell or have sold, including by 
means of a license to a Third Party, any other long acting (1-week or 
longer) injectable product containing buprenorphine as an active 
pharmaceutical ingredient for any indication (Competing Product), other 
than the Products, in the Licensed Territory.  The foregoing restriction 
shall not prohibit Braeburn from researching, developing or commercializing 
a long-acting implantable (not injectable) buprenorphine product.  
Additionally, the foregoing restriction shall not apply to any Third Party 
that acquires an interest in a Party or the assets of a Party, in either 
case, otherwise sufficient for that Third Party to be deemed an Affiliate 
of such Party hereunder.  In the event that Braeburn desires to promote, 
market, sell or have sold, including by means of license to a Third Party, 
a Competing Product in the Licensed Territory, it shall notify Camurus 
thereof in writing where after the Parties shall negotiate in good faith 
the terms and conditions of an agreement under which Braeburn may promote, 
market or sell such Competing Product, provided that neither Party shall 
have any obligation to enter into such an agreement.
 
If during the Non-Compete Period, Camurus has received a bona fide offer or 
proposal from a Third Party encompassing key financial and commercial 
terms, or otherwise has agreed on principal terms with a Third Party, in 
either case to develop or commercialize any pharmaceutical product for the 
indication of opioid addiction or pain that is a sustained release 
injectable formulation that does not contain buprenorphine as an active 
pharmaceutical ingredient and that is claimed by or incorporating any 
Camurus IP (the ROFR Product), then Camurus shall offer Braeburn a right 
of first refusal with respect to each such ROFR Product as follows:  Prior 
to Camurus granting rights to such Third Party to develop and commercialize 
the ROFR Product in the Licensed Territory, Camurus shall give Braeburn 
prompt written notice

a Notice of Exercise to Camurus.  Upon Camurus receipt of a Notice of 
Exercise, the Parties shall enter into good faith negotiations for an 
exclusive license agreement on commercially reasonable terms.  If Braeburn 
has not delivered a Notice of Exercise within the [***] period, or the 
Parties are unable to reach agreement on an exclusive license agreement 
within [***] from such Notice of Exercise, then Braeburn shall have no 
further rights hereunder with respect to such ROFR Product; provided, that

the right to sublicense, to develop, make or have made, use, sell, offer 
for sale, market and promote under the Braeburn IP (but excluding 
Braeburns Development Data which is addressed in Section 3.9) Products in 
the Camurus Territory.  During the Term and after the expiration of the 
Term, the foregoing licenses shall be fully paid-up, but if this Agreement 
is terminated and the foregoing licenses survive termination in accordance 
with Section 11.4(a), then the licenses shall be royalty-bearing in

3.1                               Braeburn Development Responsibilities and 
Diligence.  Braeburn shall have the responsibility to develop the Products 
within the scope of the rights granted to it hereunder at its own cost in 
accordance with the development plan and corresponding budget for each 
Product (each, a Development Plan, and collectively, the Development 
Plans).  The initial Development Plan for CAM2038 is attached hereto as 
Exhibit 3.1.  Braeburn shall exercise Commercially Reasonable Efforts to 
develop the Products in the Licensed Territory, including, without 
limitation, carrying out the development work within the timelines and as 
further provided in the Development Plans and in accordance with this 
Agreement.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the activities 
described as Key Elements (as defined in Section 3.5(d)) shall always be 
executed and shall accordingly not be subject to such Commercially 
Reasonable Efforts, provided that Braeburn may modify the timelines 
established in the Development Plans and applicable to the Key Elements as 
may be required due to guidance from a Regulatory Authority.  However, 
Braeburn may assert that it is not required to perform one or more of the 
Key Elements to the extent that the activities are not permitted by 
applicable law, or require the approval of a Regulatory Authority that has 
not been granted or has been denied.  Braeburn estimates that the budget 
for the development program for CAM2038 in the Development Plan is at least 
[***].  Braeburn shall keep the JSC regularly updated with respect to its 
efforts under the Development Plans.  Braeburn shall provide to the JSC 
draft forms of protocols for Clinical Trials for the purpose of obtaining 
comments.  Braeburn shall consider in good faith all comments provided by 
Camurus through the JSC within the [***] period following the JSCs receipt

obligation to pay for any costs and expenses that exceed the budgeted costs 
and expenses in the Development Plan by more than [***] unless approved by 
Braeburn.  Such costs and expenses incurred by Camurus may be invoiced to 
Braeburn on a monthly basis.  Braeburn shall effect payment of all invoices 
to Camurus designated bank account within [***] after the date of Camurus 
invoice.  Camurus shall together with such invoices provide reasonable 
available supporting documentation of such costs and expenses (including 
relevant Third Party invoices and a list of hours worked by Camurus and a 
summary of the work performed).  Braeburn may withhold payment in respect 
of any Third Party costs that are in excess of [***] of the budgeted amount 
set forth in the Development Plan, if Braeburn disputes any amount set 
forth in an invoice and shall have the right to recoup or credit against 
future invoices any disputed amounts that, after final resolution, should 
not have been paid to Camurus.  For clarity, Camurus shall not be obliged 
to carry out any activities that are not included within the Development 
Plan and the associated budget.

Development Plan to test the application of such Product for the treatment 
of pain through a Phase 1 Clinical Trial, a Phase II Clinical Trial or any 
other Clinical Trial that may be reasonably necessary in order to initiate 
a Phase III Clinical Trial (the Pain Trial).  The budget for the Pain 
Trial shall in no event be less than [***], the IND for the Pain Trial 
shall be submitted no later than [***] after the Effective Date, and the 
first screening of a patient for participation in the Pain Trial shall 
occur no later than [***] after the later of the effectiveness of the IND

board/ethics committee approval.  Braeburn shall be responsible for 
conducting, and shall bear the costs of, the Pain Trial.  Any support 
provided by Camurus in connection with the Pain Trial shall be reimbursed 
as set forth in Section 3.2.  Should the results of the Pain Trial warrant 
further clinical development work to explore the pain indication, then 
Braeburn shall propose to the JSC an updated Development Plan for such 
indication, which plan shall be deemed a Development Plan (as defined in 
Section 3.1).
 
3.4                               Joint Steering Committee.  Upon the

request of Camurus, permit a nationally recognized independent certified 
public accountant selected by Camurus to have access during ordinary 
business hours, to such books and records as may be necessary to determine 
the correctness of any Payment Report or payment made under this Agreement 
or to obtain information as to Royalties and milestones payable in case of 
failure to report or pay pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.  The 
auditor shall execute a written confidentiality agreement with Braeburn and 
shall disclose to Camurus only the amount and accuracy of payments reported 
and actually paid or otherwise payable under this Agreement.  The auditor 
shall send a copy of the report to Braeburn at the same time it is sent to 
Camurus.  Such examination shall be conducted (a) after at least [***] 
prior written notice from Camurus, (b) at the facility(ies) where such 
books and records are maintained, and (c) no more frequently than once in 
any Calendar Year. Camurus shall be responsible for expenses for the 
independent certified public accountant, except that Braeburn shall 
reimburse Camurus in full thereof if the independent accountant determines 
the Royalties and milestones paid by Braeburn to Camurus are less than 
[***] of the amount actually owed for the period of the audit.  As a 
condition to any sublicense granted by Braeburn hereunder, Braeburn shall 
ensure that Camurus has the same audit rights as those described in this 
Section 5.9 with respect to any such Braeburn Affiliate or Sublicensee.

6.1                               Identification of CMO.  Braeburn shall 
use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to manufacture, package, label, quality 
release and to supply its requirements of Product for non-clinical, 
clinical and commercial use and sale in the Licensed Territory or identify 
and select a CMO to do so under the Braeburn Supply Agreement.  Braeburn, 
or its CMO if applicable, shall be EU and US GMP approved and able to 
manufacture according to the Regulatory Approvals in the applicable 
countries in the Territory.  Until the technology transfer process to 
Braeburn or CMO has been successfully completed as set forth in Section 6.2
, Camurus shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to supply Braeburns 
noncommercial requirements of CAM2038 and CAM2048 for the performance of

Braeburns request, Camurus shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to 
transfer to Braeburn tangible embodiments of its manufacturing technology 
as may be necessary or useful to enable Braeburn or CMO to manufacture the 
Products for non-clinical, clinical and commercial use.  Upon reasonable 
request from Braeburn, Camurus shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to 
provide technical assistance to Braeburn to enable the use of such 
manufacturing technology to manufacture the Products.  Unless otherwise 
separately agreed, the technology transfer process shall be deemed 
completed upon Braeburns or CMOs successful process validation for 
manufacture of the Products.  Prior to the technology transfer, the Parties 
will agree upon a technology transfer plan and corresponding budget.  
Braeburn shall reimburse Camurus for its direct, out-of-pocket costs and 
expenses as well as FTE Costs incurred in providing technology transfer 
assistance as requested by Braeburn.  Camurus shall be reimbursed by

elects to use a CMO to manufacture the Products, Braeburn shall enter into 
one or more Braeburn Supply Agreements with the CMO covering the technology 
transfer, process development, scale-up and manufacture of the Products, 
Once Braeburn has commenced manufacture of the Products, either itself or 
through a CMO, Camurus shall be entitled to source its and its licensees 
non-clinical, clinical and commercial requirements of Products for the 
Camurus Territory from Braeburn at Braeburns Manufacturing Cost.  The 
Parties shall enter into separate supply agreements governing the terms and 
conditions of such supply from Braeburn (or CMO if applicable) to Camurus.  
If Camurus cannot source its requirements of Products from CMO or Braeburn, 
as applicable, then Braeburn shall provide such manufacturing technology as 
may be reasonably necessary to enable Camurus designated CMO to 
manufacture the Product for Camurus non-clinical, clinical, and commercial 
use, and shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to provide technical 
assistance to effectively enable the use of such information and technology 
to manufacture the Products.  Unless otherwise separately agreed, the 
technology transfer process shall be deemed completed upon Camurus CMOs 
successful process validation for manufacture of the Products.  Prior to 
such technology transfer, the Parties will agree upon a technology transfer 
plan and corresponding budget.  Camurus shall reimburse Braeburn for its 
direct, out-of-pocket costs and expenses as well as FTE Costs incurred in 
providing such assistance as requested by Camurus.  Braeburn shall be 
reimbursed by Camurus [***] of receipt of an invoice setting forth such 
costs and expenses.
 
6.4                               Change in Product Specification and 
Manufacturing Process.  Camurus and Braeburn shall ensure that all 
contemplated changes in the Product specification and manufacturing process 
as well as all documentation and information relating to a change that may 
require notification to any Regulatory Approval in respect of Products in 
the Territory shall be communicated to the other Party on a timely basis 
and such changes shall be discussed through the JSC.  Subject to the 
foregoing sentence, all such activities shall be coordinated and finally 
controlled by Cam urns prior to successful process validation at Braeburn 
or its CMO and by Braeburn thereafter, in order to ensure conformity in 
respect of Product specification and manufacturing process between Product 
manufactured for the Licensed Territory and the Camurus Territory, 
respectively.

select, after due consideration by the JSC, and shall register and 
maintain, at its expense, such Product Trademarks as shall be used for the 
promotion, marketing and sale of the Products in the Licensed Territory.  
Braeburn shall own such Product Trademarks and all goodwill associated 
therewith.  Camurus is granted the option to obtain a non-exclusive, 
sublicensable, fully paid-up right and license to use the Product 
Trademarks in the distribution, marketing, promotion and sale of Products 
in the Camurus Territory.  If Camurus elects to exercise the option, then 
Braeburns obligations under Section 7.1(c) with respect to the Camurus 
Trademarks shall apply to Camurus use of the Product Trademarks as if 
Camurus were Braeburn thereunder.  Braeburn shall provide relevant

(b)                                 The Parties shall jointly own all Joint 
Inventions, other than those covered above in (a), and, subject to the 
rights granted each Party under this Agreement, each Party may make, use, 
sell, keep, license or assign its interest in Joint Inventions and 
otherwise undertake all activities a sole owner might undertake with 
respect to such Joint Inventions, without the consent of and without 
accounting to the other Party.  Joint Inventions means Collaboration 
Inventions for which it is determined, in accordance with the patent law of 
England, that both:  (i) one or more employees, consultants or agents of 
Camurus or its Affiliates or any other persons obligated to assign such 
Collaboration Invention to Camurus; and (ii) one or more employees, 
consultants or agents of Braeburn or its Affiliates or any other persons 
obligated to assign such Collaboration Invention to Braeburn, are joint 
inventors of the Collaboration Invention.  For any Joint IP covered by this 
Section 7.2(b) that could be the subject of an application for a Patent 
Right, the JSC, in conjunction with each Partys patent counsel, will make 
an initial determination of inventorship prior to filing the application 
therefor to confirm that it is Joint IP.  Each Party will provide 
information and records relevant to such determination to the JSC and such 
patent counsel.  If the JSC fails to agree whether there has been joint 
inventorship, the application for the Patent Right will continue to be 
filed as Joint IP under the procedures set out in this Section 7 and the 
dispute will be referred to a Third Party patent attorney acceptable to 
each of the Parties for Expert Determination as provided in Exhibit 7.2(b)
.
 
(c)                                  Subject to appropriate confidentiality 
undertakings, each Party shall notify the other Party promptly after the 
completion of invention disclosure statements for each Collaboration 
Invention (or, if any provisional or other patent applications are filed 
claiming such invention, promptly after such filing), and, to the extent a 
Party is granted rights hereunder in such Collaboration Invention, shall 
provide a copy of the same to the other Party.
 
(d)                                 For the avoidance of doubt, neither 
Party is granted any license rights to any Intellectual Property rights of 
the other Party which may be required for such Party to use a Collaboration 
Invention, unless otherwise expressly granted herein.
 
(e)                                  Each of the Parties shall do all such 
acts and things, and execute all such deeds and documents, as may be 
necessary or desirable for them to perfect their rights of ownership as 
specified in Section 7.2 and otherwise implement the provisions of this 
Section 7.  Each Party shall, and shall cause its applicable Affiliates, 
Third Party subcontractors, and their respective employees and agents, to 
perform at the requesting Partys cost all reasonable acts reasonably 
requested, including the execution of confirmatory deeds and assignment 
documents of Patent Rights, as may be necessary or desirable for them to 
perfect their title therein in accordance with the forgoing provisions of 
this Section 7.2.
 
7.3                               Prosecution of Patents.

    8.                                      CONFIDENTIALITY
 
8.1                               Except to the extent expressly authorized 
by this Agreement or otherwise agreed in writing, each Recipient and its 
Affiliates, Sublicensees and licensees in possession of Confidential 
Information shall maintain such Confidential Information as confidential 
and use it only for the purposes of this Agreement in accordance with this 
Section 8.  This obligation shall continue for a period equal to the longer 
of:  (a) [***] after the date of expiration or termination of this 
Agreement; or (b) for so long as the exceptions set out below in the next 
subsequent paragraph do not apply to the relevant Confidential Information. 
 Each Party shall guard such Confidential Information using the same degree 
of care as it normally uses to guard its own confidential, proprietary 
information of like importance, but in any event no less than reasonable 
care.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Recipient of the categories of 
Confidential Information identified in Sections 1.26(b) through (d) 
inclusive shall be relieved of the confidentiality and limited use 
obligations of this Agreement to the extent that the Recipient establishes 
by written evidence that:
 
(a)                                 the Confidential Information was 
previously known to the Recipient from sources other than the Disclosing 
Party at the time of disclosure and other than under an obligation of 
confidentiality and non-use;
 
(b)                                 the Confidential Information was 
generally available to the public or otherwise part of the public domain at 
the time of its disclosure;
 
(c)                                  the Confidential Information became 
generally available to the public or otherwise part of the public domain 
after its disclosure to the Recipient Party other than through any act or 
omission of the Recipient Party in breach of this Agreement;
 
(d)                                 the Confidential Information is 
acquired in good faith in the future by the Recipient Party from a Third 
Party who has a lawful right to disclose such information and who is not 
under an obligation of confidence to the Disclosing Party with respect to 
such information; or
 
(e)                                  the Confidential Information is 
subsequently developed by or on behalf of the Recipient Party without use 
of the Disclosing Partys Confidential Information.
 
8.2                               For clarity, specific aspects or details 
of Confidential Information shall not be deemed to be within the public 
domain or in the possession of the Recipient Party merely because the 
Confidential Information is embraced by more general information in the 
public domain or in the possession of the Recipient Party.  Further, any 
combination of Confidential Information shall not be considered in the 
public domain or in the possession of the Recipient Party merely because 
individual elements of such Confidential Information are in the public 
domain or in the possession of the Recipient Party unless the combination 
is in the public domain or in the possession of the Recipient Party.
 
8.3                               Notwithstanding the above obligations of 
confidentiality and non-use a Recipient Party may:

Know-How is exclusively licensed by one Party to the other, the licensor 
may not continue to use and disclose such Know-How in a manner not 
consistent with the exclusivity of the license granted.
