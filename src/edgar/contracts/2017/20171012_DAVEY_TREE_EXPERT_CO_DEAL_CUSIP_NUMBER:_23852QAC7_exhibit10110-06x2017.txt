      that Borrower has paid any amounts in excess of the amounts Borrower

ARTICLE II.


AMOUNT AND TERMS OF CREDIT


SECTION 2.1    AMOUNT AND NATURE OF CREDIT. Subject to the terms and 
conditions of this Agreement, each Bank will participate to the extent 
hereinafter provided in making Loans to Borrower, and issuing Letters of 
Credit at the request of Borrower, in such aggregate amount as Borrower 
shall request pursuant to the Commitment; provided, however, that in no 
event shall the aggregate principal amount of all Loans and Letters of 
Credit outstanding under this Agreement be in excess of the Total 
Commitment Amount.


Each Bank, for itself and not one for any other, agrees to participate in 
Loans made and Letters of Credit issued hereunder during the Commitment 
Period on such basis that (a) immediately after the completion of any 
borrowing of Revolving Loans by Borrower or issuance of a Letter of Credit 
hereunder, the aggregate principal amount then outstanding on the Revolving 
Credit Notes issued to such Bank, when combined with such Bank’s pro rata 
share of the Letter of Credit Exposure, shall not be in excess of the 
Revolving Credit Commitment for such Bank, and (b) such aggregate principal 
amount outstanding on the Revolving Credit Notes issued to such Bank shall 
represent that percentage of the aggregate principal amount then 
outstanding on all Revolving Credit Notes (including the Revolving Credit 
Notes held by such Bank) that is such Bank’s Commitment Percentage.


Each borrowing from the Banks hereunder shall be made pro rata according to 
the Banks’ respective Commitment Percentages. The Loans may be made as 
Revolving Loans or Swing Line Loans, and Letters of Credit may be issued, 
as follows:


      A.
Revolving Loans.
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, during the 
Commitment Period, the Banks shall make a Revolving Loan or Revolving Loans 
to Borrower in such amount or amounts as Borrower may from time to time 
request, but not exceeding in aggregate principal amount at any time 
outstanding hereunder the Total Revolving Commitment Amount, when such 
Revolving Loans are combined with the Letter of Credit Exposure. Borrower 
shall have the option, subject to the terms and conditions set forth 
herein, to borrow Revolving Loans, maturing on the last day of the 
Commitment Period, by means of any combination of (a) Base Rate Loans or 
(b) LIBOR Loans.


Borrower shall pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of Base Rate 
Loans outstanding from time to time from the date thereof until paid at the 
Base Rate from time to time in effect. Interest on such Base Rate Loans 
shall be payable, commencing December 31, 2017, and on the last day of each 
succeeding March, June, September and December thereafter and at the 
maturity thereof.


Borrower shall pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of each LIBOR 
Loan outstanding from time to time, from the date thereof until paid, at 
the Derived LIBOR Rate, fixed in advance for each Interest Period (but 
subject to changes in the Applicable LIBOR Margin) as herein provided for 
each such Interest Period. Interest on such LIBOR Loans shall be payable on 
each Interest Adjustment Date with respect to an Interest Period (provided 
that if an Interest Period exceeds three




NAI-1502980324v12

26

------------------------------------------------------------------------


(3) months, the interest must be paid every three (3) months, commencing 
three (3) months from the beginning of such Interest Period).


At the request of Borrower to Agent, subject to the notice and other 
provisions of Section 2.2 hereof, the Banks shall convert Base Rate Loans 
to LIBOR Loans at any time and shall convert LIBOR Loans to Base Rate Loans 
on any Interest Adjustment Date.


The obligation of Borrower to repay the Base Rate Loans and LIBOR Loans 
that are Revolving Loans made by each Bank and to pay interest thereon 
shall be evidenced by a Revolving Credit Note of Borrower in the form of 
Exhibit A hereto, payable to such Bank in the principal amount of its 
Revolving Credit Commitment, or, if less, the aggregate unpaid principal 
amount of Revolving Loans made hereunder by such Bank. Subject to the 
provisions of this Agreement, Borrower shall be entitled under this 
Section 2.1A to borrow Revolving Loans, repay the same in whole or in part 
and re-borrow hereunder at any time and from time to time during the 
Commitment Period.


      B.
Swing Line Loans.
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, during the 
Commitment Period, the Swing Line Lender shall make a Swing Line Loan to 
Borrower in such amount or amounts as Borrower may from time to time 
request, but not exceeding in aggregate principal amount at any time 
outstanding hereunder the Swing Line Commitment. Swing Line Loans: (i) 
shall be payable on the Swing Line Loan Maturity Date applicable to each 
such Swing Line Loan; (ii) shall be made only in U.S. Dollars; (iii) may be 
repaid or prepaid and reborrowed in accordance with the provisions hereof; 
(iv) may only be made if after giving effect thereto (A) the aggregate 
principal amount of Swing Line Loans outstanding does not exceed the Swing 
Line Commitment, and (B) the Revolving Credit Exposure would not exceed the 
Total Commitment Amount; (v) shall not be made if, after giving effect 
thereto, Borrower would be required to prepay Loans or Cash Collateralize 
Letters of Credit pursuant to Section 2.8 hereof; (vi) shall not be made if 
the proceeds thereof would be used to repay, in whole or in part, any 
outstanding Swing Line Loan and (vii) at no time shall there be more than 
one (1) borrowing of Swing Line Loans outstanding hereunder. Borrower shall 
have the option, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, to 
borrow Swing Line Loans, maturing on the applicable Swing Line Loan 
Maturity Date, by means of Daily LIBOR Rate Loans.


Borrower shall pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Daily 
LIBOR Loan outstanding from time to time, from the date thereof until paid, 
at the Daily LIBOR Rate. Interest on such Daily LIBOR Loans shall be 
payable on the applicable Swing Line Loan Maturity Date.


      1.Swing Line Loan Refunding. The Swing Line Lender may at any time,
      in its sole and absolute discretion, direct that the Swing Line Loans
      owing to it be refunded by delivering a notice to such effect to the
      Agent, specifying the aggregate principal amount thereof (a “Notice
      of Swing Line Loan Refunding”). Promptly upon receipt of a Notice of
      Swing Line Loan Refunding, the Agent shall give notice of the
      contents thereof to the Banks with Commitments and, unless an Event
      of Default specified in Section 7.11 in respect of Borrower has
      occurred, to Borrower. Each such Notice of Swing Line Loan Refunding
      shall be deemed to constitute delivery by Borrower under such Swing
      Line Loan of a Notice of Loan requesting Revolving Loans consisting
      of Daily LIBOR Loans in the amount of the




NAI-1502980324v12

27

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      Swing Line Loan to which it relates. Each Bank with a Revolving
      Credit Commitment (including the Swing Line Lender) hereby
      unconditionally agrees (notwithstanding that any of the conditions
      specified in Section 2.2 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall not
      have been satisfied, but subject to the provisions of paragraph 3.
      below) to make a Revolving Loan to Borrower in the amount of such
      Bank’s Commitment Percentage of the aggregate amount of the Swing
      Line Loans to which such Notice of Swing Line Loan Refunding relates.
      Each such Bank shall make the amount of such Revolving Loan available
      to the Agent by wire transfer of immediately available funds, in the
      same manner as provided in Section 2.2 with respect to Revolving
      Loans not later than 3:00 P.M. (Cleveland, Ohio time), if such notice
      is received by such Bank prior to 11:00 A.M. (Cleveland, Ohio time),
      or not later than 2:00 P.M. (Cleveland, Ohio time) on the next
      Business Day, if such notice is received by such Bank after such
      time. The proceeds of such Revolving Loans shall be made immediately
      available to the Swing Line Lender and applied by it to repay the
      principal amount of the Swing Line Loans to which such Notice of
      Swing Line Loan Refunding relates.


      2.Swing Line Loan Participation. If prior to the time a Revolving
      Loan would otherwise have been made as provided above as a
      consequence of a Notice of Swing Line Loan Refunding, any of the
      events specified in Section 7.11 shall have occurred in respect of
      Borrower or one or more of the Banks with Revolving Credit
      Commitments shall determine that it is legally prohibited from making
      a Revolving Loan under such circumstances, each Bank (other than the
      Swing Line Lender), or each Bank (other than such Swing Line Lender)
      so prohibited, as the case may be, shall, on the date such Revolving
      Loan would have been made by it (the “Purchase Date”), purchase an
      undivided participating interest (a “Swing Line Loan Participation”)
      in the outstanding Swing Line Loans to which such Notice of Swing
      Line Loan Refunding relates, in an amount (the “Swing Line Loan
      Participation Amount”) equal to such Bank’s Commitment Percentage of
      such outstanding Swing Line Loans. On the Purchase Date, each such
      Bank or each such Bank so prohibited, as the case may be, shall pay
      to the Swing Line Lender, in immediately available funds, such Bank’s
      Swing Line Loan Participation Amount, and promptly upon receipt
      thereof the Swing Line Lender shall, if requested by such other Bank,
      deliver to such Bank a participation certificate, dated the date of
      the Swing Line Lender’s receipt of the funds from, and evidencing
      such Bank’s Swing Line Loan Participation in, such Swing Line Loans
      and its Swing Line Loan Participation Amount in respect thereof. If
      any amount required to be paid by a Bank to the Swing Line Lender
      pursuant to the above provisions in respect of any Swing Line Loan
      Participation is not paid on the date such payment is due, such Bank
      shall pay to the Swing Line Lender on demand interest on the amount
      not so paid at the overnight Federal Funds Effective Rate from the
      due date until such amount is paid in full. Whenever, at any time
      after the Swing Line Lender has received from any other Bank such
      Bank’s Swing Line Loan Participation Amount, the Swing Line Lender
      receives any payment from or on behalf of Borrower on account of the
      related Swing Line Loans, the Swing Line Lender will promptly
      distribute to such Bank its ratable share of such amount based on its
      Commitment Percentage of such amount on such date on account of its
      Swing Line Loan Participation (appropriately adjusted, in the case of
      interest payments, to reflect the period of time during which such
      Bank’s participating interest was outstanding and funded); provided, 
      however, that if such payment received by the Swing Line Lender is
      required to




NAI-1502980324v12

28

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      be returned, such Bank will return to the Swing Line Lender any
      portion thereof previously distributed to it by the Swing Line
      Lender.


      3.Obligations Unconditional. Each Bank’s obligation to make Revolving
      Loans pursuant to Section 2.1B and/or to purchase Swing Line Loan
      Participations in connection with a Notice of Swing Line Loan
      Refunding shall be subject to the conditions that (i) such Bank shall
      have received a Notice of Swing Line Loan Refunding complying with
      the provisions hereof and (ii) at the time the Swing Line Loans that
      are the subject of such Notice of Swing Line Loan Refunding were
      made, the Swing Line Lender making the same had no actual written
      notice from another Bank that an Event of Default had occurred and
      was continuing, but otherwise shall be absolute and unconditional,
      shall be solely for the benefit of the Swing Line Lender that gives
      such Notice of Swing Line Loan Refunding, and shall not be affected
      by any circumstance, including, without limitation, (A) any set-off,
      counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right that such Bank may
      have against any other Bank, Borrower, any Guarantor, or any other
      Person, or Borrower or Guarantor may have against any Bank or other
      Person, as the case may be, for any reason whatsoever; (B) the
      occurrence or continuance of a Default or Event of Default; (C) any
      event or circumstance involving a Material Adverse Effect; (D) any
      breach of any Loan Document by any party thereto; or (E) any other
      circumstance, happening or event, whether or not similar to any of
      the foregoing.


Upon the request of any Bank, the obligation of Borrower to repay the Swing 
Line Loan made by such Bank and to pay interest thereon shall be evidenced 
by a Swing Line Loan Note of Borrower in the form of Exhibit B hereto, 
payable to the Swing Line Lender in the principal amount of its Swing Line 
Loan Participation Amount, or, if less, the aggregate unpaid principal 
amount of Swing Line Loans made hereunder by the Swing Line Lender. Subject 
to the provisions of this Agreement, Borrower shall be entitled under this 
Section 2.1B to borrow funds, repay the same in whole or in part and 
re-borrow hereunder at any time and from time to time during the Commitment 
Period.


      C.
Letters of Credit.
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, during the 
Commitment Period, the Fronting Bank, in its own name, but only as agent 
for the Banks, shall issue such Letters of Credit for the account of 
Borrower, any Guarantor of Payment or the Insurance Subsidiary as Borrower 
may from time to time request. Borrower shall not request any Letter of 
Credit (and the Fronting Bank shall not be obligated to issue any Letter of 
Credit) if, after giving effect thereto, (a) the Letter of Credit Exposure 
would exceed the Letter of Credit Commitment or (b) the Revolving Credit 
Exposure would exceed the Total Commitment Amount. The issuance of each 
Letter of Credit shall confer upon each Bank the benefits and liabilities 
of a participation consisting of an undivided pro rata interest in the 
Letter of Credit to the extent of such Bank’s Commitment Percentage.


Each request for a Letter of Credit shall be delivered to Agent not later 
than 11:00 A.M. (Cleveland, Ohio time) three (3) Business Days prior to the 
day upon which the Letter of Credit is to be issued. Each such request 
shall be in a form acceptable to Agent (and the Fronting Bank if the 
Fronting Bank is a Bank other than Agent) and specify the face amount 
thereof, whether such Letter of Credit is a commercial documentary or a 
standby Letter of Credit, the beneficiary, the




NAI-1502980324v12

29

------------------------------------------------------------------------


intended date of issuance, the expiry date thereof (which date shall not be 
later than the last day of the Commitment Period, unless Borrower Cash 
Collateralizes such Letters of Credit in a manner reasonably acceptable to 
Agent), and the nature of the transaction to be supported thereby. 
Concurrently with each such request, Borrower, any Guarantor of Payment for 
whose benefit the Letter of Credit is to be issued, or the Insurance 
Subsidiary, as appropriate, shall execute and deliver to the Fronting Bank 
an appropriate application and agreement, being in the standard form of the 
Fronting Bank for such letters of credit, as amended to conform to the 
provisions of this Agreement if required by Agent. Agent shall give each 
Bank notice of each such request for a Letter of Credit.


In respect of each Letter of Credit and the drafts thereunder, if any, 
whether issued for the account of Borrower, a Guarantor of Payment or the 
Insurance Subsidiary, Borrower agrees (a) to pay to Agent, for the pro rata 
benefit of the Banks, a non-refundable commission based upon the face 
amount of the Letter of Credit, which shall be paid quarterly in arrears at 
a rate per annum equal to the Applicable LIBOR Margin (in effect on the 
date such Letter of Credit is issued or renewed) times the face amount of 
such Letter of Credit during such fiscal quarter (the “Letter of Credit Fee
”); (b) to pay to Agent, for its own account as issuing bank, a fronting 
fee based upon the face amount of the Letter of Credit, which shall be paid 
quarterly in arrears, at a rate per annum equal to ten (10) basis points 
times the face amount of such Letter of Credit; and (c) to pay to the 
Fronting Bank, for its sole account, such other issuance, amendment, 
negotiation, draw, acceptance, telex, courier, postage and similar 
transactional fees as are generally charged by the Fronting Bank under its 
fee schedule as in effect from time to time.


Whenever a Letter of Credit is drawn, Borrower shall immediately reimburse 
the Fronting Bank for the amount drawn. In the event that the amount drawn 
is not reimbursed by Borrower within one (1) Business Day of the drawing of 
such Letter of Credit, at the sole option of Agent (and the Fronting Bank, 
if the Fronting Bank is a Bank other than Agent), Borrower shall be deemed 
to have requested a Revolving Loan, subject to the provisions of Section 
2.1A, in the amount drawn. Such Revolving Loan shall be evidenced by the 
Revolving Credit Notes. Each Bank agrees to make a Revolving Loan on the 
date of such notice, subject to no conditions precedent whatsoever. Each 
Bank acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to make a Revolving Loan 
pursuant to Section 2.1A when required by this Section 2.1C is absolute and 
unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, 
including, without limitation, the occurrence and continuance of a Default 
or Event of Default, and that its payment to Agent, for the account of the 
Fronting Bank, of the proceeds of such Revolving Loan shall be made without 
any offset, abatement, recoupment, counterclaim, withholding or reduction 
whatsoever and whether or not such Bank’s Revolving Credit Commitment shall 
have been reduced or terminated. Borrower irrevocably authorizes and 
instructs Agent to apply the proceeds of any borrowing pursuant to this 
paragraph to reimburse, in full, the Fronting Bank for the amount drawn on 
such Letter of Credit. Each such Revolving Loan shall be deemed to be a 
Base Rate Loan unless otherwise requested by and available to Borrower 
hereunder. Each Bank is hereby authorized to record on its records relating 
to its Revolving Credit Note such Bank’s pro rata share of the amounts paid 
and not reimbursed on the Letters of Credit.


If, for any reason, Agent (or the Fronting Bank if the Fronting Bank is a 
Bank other than Agent) is unable to or, in the opinion of Agent, it is 
impracticable to, convert any Letter of Credit to a Revolving Loan pursuant 
to the preceding paragraph, Agent (or the Fronting Bank if the Fronting 
Bank is a Bank other than Agent) shall have the right to request that each 
Bank purchase a




NAI-1502980324v12

30

------------------------------------------------------------------------


participation in the amount due with respect to such Letter of Credit, and 
Agent shall promptly notify each Bank thereof (by facsimile or telephone, 
confirmed in writing). Upon such notice, but without further action, Agent 
(or the Fronting Bank if the Fronting Bank is a Bank other than Agent) 
hereby agrees to grant to each Bank, and each Bank hereby agrees to acquire 
from Agent (or the Fronting Bank if the Fronting Bank is a Bank other than 
Agent), an undivided participation interest in the amount due with respect 
to such Letter of Credit in an amount equal to such Bank’s Commitment 
Percentage of the aggregate principal amount of the amount due with respect 
to such Letter of Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the 
foregoing, each Bank hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees, upon 
receipt of notice as provided above, to pay to Agent (or the Fronting Bank 
if the Fronting Bank is a Bank other than Agent), for its sole account, 
such Bank’s ratable share of the amount due with respect to such Letter of 
Credit (determined in accordance with such Bank’s Commitment Percentage). 
Each Bank acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire 
participations in the amount due under any Letter of Credit that is drawn 
but not reimbursed by Borrowers pursuant to this Section 2.1C is absolute 
and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, 
including, without limitation, the occurrence and continuance of a Default 
or Event of Default, and that each such payment shall be made without any 
offset, abatement, recoupment, counterclaim, withholding or reduction 
whatsoever and whether or not such Bank’s Revolving Credit Commitment shall 
have been reduced or terminated. Each Bank shall comply with its obligation 
under this Section 2.1C by wire transfer of immediately available funds, in 
the same manner as provided in Section 2.2 with respect to Revolving Loans. 
Each Bank is hereby authorized to record on its records such Bank’s pro 
rata share of the amounts paid and not reimbursed on the Letters of Credit.


SECTION 2.2    CONDITIONS TO LOANS AND LETTERS OF CREDIT. The obligation of 
the Banks to make a Loan, convert a LIBOR Loan or Base Rate Loan or 
continue a LIBOR Loan and of Agent to issue any Letter of Credit is 
conditioned, in the case of each borrowing, conversion or continuation of a 
Loan or issuance of a Letter of Credit hereunder, upon:


      (a)    all conditions precedent as listed in Article IV hereof shall
      have been satisfied;


      (b)    with respect to Base Rate Loans, receipt by Agent of a Notice
      of Loan, such notice to be received by 2:00 P.M. (Cleveland, Ohio
      time) on the proposed date of borrowing or conversion, with respect
      to LIBOR Loans (other than Daily LIBOR Loans), by 2:00 P.M.
      (Cleveland, Ohio time) three (3) Business Days prior to the proposed
      date of borrowing, conversion or continuation and with respect to
      Daily LIBOR Loans by 2:00 P.M. (Cleveland, Ohio time) on the proposed
      date of borrowing. Agent shall notify each Bank of the date, amount
      and initial Interest Period (if applicable) promptly upon the receipt
      of such notice, and, in any event, by 2:00 P.M. (Cleveland, Ohio
      time) on the date such notice is received. On the date such Loan is
      to be made, each Bank shall provide Agent, not later than 3:00 P.M.
      (Cleveland, Ohio time), with the amount in federal or other
      immediately available funds, required of it;




NAI-1502980324v12

31

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      (c)    with respect to Letters of Credit, satisfaction of the notice
      provisions set forth in Section 2.1C hereof;


      (d)    Borrower’s request for (i) a Base Rate Loan shall be in an
      amount of not less than One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000),
      increased by increments of Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000), (ii) a
      LIBOR Loan shall be in an amount of not less than One Million Dollars
      ($1,000,000), increased by increments of One Million Dollars
      ($1,000,000) and (iii) a Swing Line Loan shall be in an amount of not
      less than One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000);


      (e)    the fact that no Default or Event of Default shall then exist
      or immediately after the making, conversion or continuation of the
      Loan or issuance of the Letter of Credit would exist; and


      (f)    the fact that each of the representations and warranties
      contained in Article VI hereof shall be true and correct with the
      same force and effect as if made on and as of the date of the making,
      conversion, or continuation of such Loan, or the issuance of the
      Letter of Credit, except to the extent that any thereof expressly
      relate to an earlier date.


At no time shall Borrower request that LIBOR Loans be outstanding for more 
than ten (10) different Interest Periods at any time.


Each request by Borrower for the making of a Loan, conversion of a LIBOR 
Loan or Base Rate Loan or continuation of a LIBOR Loan, or for the issuance 
of a Letter of Credit hereunder shall be deemed to be a representation and 
warranty by Borrower as of the date of such request as to the facts 
specified in (e) and (f) above.


Each request for a LIBOR Loan shall be irrevocable and binding on Borrower 
and Borrower shall indemnify Agent and the Banks against any loss or 
expense incurred by Agent or the Banks as a result of any failure by 
Borrower to consummate such transaction including, without limitation, any 
loss (including loss of anticipated profits) or expense incurred by reason 
of liquidation or re-employment of deposits or other funds acquired by the 
Banks to fund such LIBOR Loan. A certificate as to the amount of such loss 
or expense submitted by the Banks to Borrower shall be conclusive and 
binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.


SECTION 2.3    PAYMENT ON NOTES, ETC. All payments of principal, interest 
and commitment and other fees shall be made to Agent in immediately 
available funds for the account of the Banks. Agent, within one (1) 
Business Day, shall distribute to each Bank its ratable share of the amount 
of principal, interest, and commitment and other fees received by it for 
the account of such Bank. Each Bank shall record (a) any principal, 
interest or other payment, and (b) the principal amount of the Base Rate 
Loans and LIBOR Loans and all prepayments thereof and the applicable dates 
with respect thereto, by such method as such Bank may generally employ; 
provided, however, that failure to make any such entry shall in no way 
detract from Borrower’s obligations under each Note. The aggregate unpaid 
amount of Loans set forth on the records of Agent shall be rebuttably 
presumptive evidence of the principal and interest owing and unpaid on each 
Note. Whenever any payment to be made hereunder, including, without 
limitation, any payment to be made on any Note, shall be stated to be due 
on a day that is not a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the




NAI-1502980324v12

32

------------------------------------------------------------------------


next succeeding Business Day and such extension of time shall in each case 
be included in the computation of the interest payable on such Note; 
provided, however, that, with respect to any LIBOR Loan, if the next 
succeeding Business Day falls in the succeeding calendar month, such 
payment shall be made on the preceding Business Day and the relevant 
Interest Period shall be adjusted accordingly.


SECTION 2.4    PREPAYMENT. Borrower shall have the right at any time or 
from time to time to prepay, on a pro rata basis for all of the Banks, all 
or any part of the principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, as 
designated by Borrower, plus interest accrued on the amount so prepaid to 
the date of such prepayment. Borrower shall give Agent notice of prepayment 
of any Base Rate Loan by not later than 2:00 P.M. (Cleveland, Ohio time) on 
the Business Day such prepayment is to be made and notice of the prepayment 
of any LIBOR Loan (other than any Swing Line Loan) not later than 2:00 P.M. 
(Cleveland, Ohio time) three (3) Business Days before the Business Day on 
which such prepayment is to be made. Prepayments of Base Rate Loans shall 
be without any premium or penalty, other than any prepayment fees, 
penalties or other charges that may be contained in any Hedge Agreement. 
Each partial prepayment shall be in an aggregate principal amount of at 
least, in the case of a LIBOR Loan (other than a Swing Line Loan), One 
Million Dollars ($1,000,000) (or, if less, the full amount of such LIBOR 
Loan), or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof. Any 
prepayment made pursuant to this Section 2.4 shall be accompanied by any 
amounts payable in respect thereof under Article III hereof.


SECTION 2.5    COMMITMENT AND OTHER FEES; REDUCTION OF COMMITMENT.


      (a)    Borrower shall pay to Agent, for the ratable account of the
      Banks, as a consideration for the Revolving Credit Commitment, a
      commitment fee from the date hereof to and including the last day of
      the Commitment Period, payable quarterly, equal to (a) the Applicable
      Commitment Fee Rate in effect on the payment date, times (b) (i) the
      Total Revolving Commitment Amount minus (ii) the average daily
      Revolving Credit Exposure (other than outstanding Swing Line Loans)
      during such quarter. The commitment fee shall be payable in arrears,
      on December 31, 2017 and on the last day of each succeeding March,
      June, September and December thereafter, and on the last day of the
      Commitment Period.


      (b)    Borrower shall pay to Agent, for its sole benefit, the agent
      fees agreed to by Agent and Borrower from time to time.


      (c)    Borrower may at any time or from time to time permanently
      reduce in whole or ratably (for all of the Banks) in part the
      Revolving Credit Commitments of the Banks hereunder to an amount not
      less than the then existing Revolving Credit Exposure, by giving
      notice to Agent not fewer than three (3) Business Days in advance of
      the proposed date of such reduction, provided that any such partial
      reduction shall be in an aggregate amount for all of the Banks of not
      less than Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000), increased by increments
      of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000). Agent shall promptly notify each
      Bank of the date of each such reduction and such Bank’s proportionate
      share thereof. After each such reduction, the commitment fees payable
      hereunder shall be calculated upon the Total Revolving Commitment
      Amount as so reduced. If Borrower reduces in whole the Total
      Revolving Commitment Amount of the Banks, on the effective date of
      such reduction (Borrower having




NAI-1502980324v12

33

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      prepaid in full the unpaid principal balance, if any, of the
      Revolving Credit Notes, together with all interest and commitment and
      other fees accrued and unpaid, and provided that no issued and
      outstanding Letters of Credit shall exist), all of the Revolving
      Credit Notes shall be delivered to Agent marked “Canceled” and Agent
      shall redeliver such Revolving Credit Notes to Borrower. Any partial
      reduction in the Commitment shall be effective during the remainder
      of the Commitment Period.


      (d)    At any time after the Effective Date and prior to the last day
      of the Commitment Period, Borrower may, by written notice to Agent,
      request that the Total Revolving Commitment Amount be increased up to
      the maximum principal amount of Three Hundred Twenty-Five Million
      Dollars ($325,000,000), so long as no Default or Event of Default has
      occurred and is continuing at the time of such request and on the
      date of and after giving effect to any such increase. Upon receipt of
      any such request, Agent shall deliver a copy of such request to each
      Bank. Borrower shall set forth in such request the amount of the
      requested increase in the Total Revolving Commitment Amount and the
      date on which such increase is requested to become effective (which
      shall be not less than (ten) 10 Business Days nor more than sixty
      (60) days after the date of such request and that, in any event, must
      be at least ninety (90) days prior to the last day of the Commitment
      Period), and shall offer each Bank the opportunity to increase its
      Revolving Credit Commitment by its Commitment Percentage of the
      proposed increased amount. Each Bank shall, by notice to Borrower and
      Agent given not more than ten (10) Business Days after the date of
      Agent’s notice, either agree to increase its Revolving Credit
      Commitment by all or a portion of the offered amount (each such Bank
      so agreeing being an “Increasing Lender”) or decline to increase its
      Revolving Credit Commitment (and any such Bank that does not deliver
      such a notice within such period of ten (10) Business Days shall be
      deemed to have declined to increase its Revolving Credit Commitment
      and each Bank so declining or being deemed to have declined being a “
      Non-Increasing Lender”). If, on the tenth (10th) Business Day after
      Agent shall have delivered notice as set forth above, the Increasing
      Lenders shall have agreed pursuant to the preceding sentence to
      increase their Revolving Credit Commitments by an aggregate amount
      less than the increase in the Total Commitment Amount requested by
      Borrower, Borrower may arrange for one or more Persons that are
      acceptable to Agent (each such Person so agreeing being an “
      Augmenting Lender”), and Borrower and each Augmenting Lender shall
      execute all such documentation as Agent shall reasonably specify to
      evidence its Revolving Credit Commitment and/or its status as a Bank
      with a Revolving Credit Commitment hereunder. Upon the execution of
      such documentation, each such Augmenting Lender shall become a party
      to this Agreement without any consent from the Banks of any kind. Any
      increase in the Total Revolving Commitment Amount may be made in an
      amount that is less than the increase requested by Borrower if
      Borrower is unable to arrange for, or chooses not to arrange for,
      Augmenting Lenders, in the full amount. Any fees charged by any
      Increasing Lender shall be based solely upon the increased amount of
      its Revolving Credit Commitment and shall not be in excess of ten
      (10) basis points.




NAI-1502980324v12

------------------------------------------------------------------------


Each of the parties hereto agrees that Agent may take any and all actions 
as may be reasonably necessary to ensure that after giving effect to any 
increase in the Total Revolving Commitment Amount pursuant to this Section 
2.5(d), the outstanding Revolving Loans (if any) are held by the Banks in 
accordance with their new Commitment Percentages. This may be accomplished 
at the discretion of Agent in consultation with Borrower:  (w) by requiring 
the outstanding Loans to be prepaid with the proceeds of new Loans; (x) by 
causing the Non-Increasing Lenders to assign portions of their outstanding 
Loans to Increasing Lenders and Augmenting Lenders; (y) by permitting the 
Loans outstanding at the time of any increase in the Total Revolving 
Commitment Amount pursuant to this Section 2.5(d) to remain outstanding 
until the last days of the respective Interest Periods therefor, even 
though the Banks would hold such Loans other than in accordance with their 
new Commitment Percentages; or (z) by any combination of the foregoing; 
provided, however that, Agent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to 
accomplish the foregoing without giving rise to, or to minimize, any 
indemnification obligations by Borrower pursuant to Article III hereof.


On the effective date of any increase in the Total Revolving Commitment 
Amount in accordance with this Section 2.5, Schedule 1 hereto shall be 
deemed automatically amended to reflect the new Revolving Credit 
Commitments and Commitment Percentages of each Bank.


SECTION 2.6    COMPUTATION OF INTEREST AND FEES; DEFAULT RATE. With the 
exception of Base Rate Loans, interest on Loans and commitment and other 
fees and charges hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year having 
three hundred sixty (360) days and calculated for the actual number of days 
elapsed. With respect to Base Rate Loans, interest shall be computed on the 
basis of a year having three hundred sixty-five (365) days or three hundred 
sixty-six (366) days, as the case may be, and calculated for the actual 
number of days elapsed. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, if 
an Event of Default shall occur hereunder, (a) the principal of each Note 
and the unpaid interest thereon shall bear interest, until paid, at the 
Default Rate; and (b) the fee for the aggregate undrawn face amount of all 
issued and outstanding Letters of Credit shall be increased from the 
Applicable LIBOR Margin then in effect to three percent (3%). In no event 
shall the rate of interest hereunder exceed the maximum rate allowable by 
law.


SECTION 2.7    MANDATORY PAYMENT. If the Revolving Credit Exposure at any 
time exceeds the Total Revolving Commitment Amount, Borrower shall, as 
promptly as practicable, but in no event later than the next Business Day, 
prepay an aggregate principal amount of the Revolving Loans sufficient to 
bring the aggregate outstanding principal amount of all Revolving Loans and 
the aggregate undrawn face amount of all issued and outstanding Letters of 
Credit within the Revolving Credit Commitments of the Banks. Any prepayment 
of a LIBOR Loan pursuant to this Section 2.7 shall be accompanied by any 
amount required to be paid pursuant to Sections 3.4 and 3.8 hereof.


SECTION 2.8    DEFAULTING BANK.


      1.    Defaulting Bank Adjustments. Notwithstanding anything to the
      contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Bank becomes a
      Defaulting Bank, then, until such time as such Bank is no longer a
      Defaulting Bank, to the extent permitted by applicable law:




NAI-1502980324v12

35

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      (a)    Waivers and Amendments. Such Defaulting Bank’s right to
      approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect
      to this Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in the definition
      of Required Banks;


      (b)    Defaulting Bank Waterfall. Any payment of principal, interest,
      fees or other amounts received by the Agent for the account of such
      Defaulting Bank (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity,
      pursuant to Article VII or otherwise) or received by the Agent from a
      Defaulting Bank shall be applied at such time or times as may be
      determined by the Agent as follows: first, to the payment of any
      amounts owing by such Defaulting Bank to the Agent hereunder; second
      , to the payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts owing by such
      Defaulting Bank to any Fronting Bank or Swing Line Lender hereunder; 
      third, to Cash Collateralize the Fronting Banks’ Fronting Exposure
      with respect to such Defaulting Bank in accordance with this Section
      2.8; fourth, as Borrower may request (so long as no Default or Event
      of Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which
      such Defaulting Bank has failed to fund its portion thereof as
      required by this Agreement, as determined by the Agent; fifth, if so
      determined by the Agent and Borrower, to be held in a deposit account
      and released pro rata in order to (x) satisfy such Defaulting Bank’s
      potential future funding obligations with respect to Loans under this
      Agreement and (y) Cash Collateralize the Fronting Banks’ future
      Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Bank with respect
      to future Letters of Credit issued under this Agreement, in
      accordance with this Section 2.8; sixth, to the payment of any
      amounts owing to the Banks, the Fronting Banks or Swing Line Lender
      as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction
      obtained by any Bank, the Fronting Banks or Swing Line Lender against
      such Defaulting Bank as a result of such Defaulting Bank’s breach of
      its obligations under this Agreement; seventh, so long as no Default
      or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to
      Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent
      jurisdiction obtained by Borrower against such Defaulting Bank as a
      result of such Defaulting Bank’s breach of its obligations under this
      Agreement; and eighth, to such Defaulting Bank or as otherwise
      directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if (x)
      such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans or
      Letter of Credit disbursements in respect of which such Defaulting
      Bank has not fully funded its appropriate share, and (y) such Loans
      were made or the related Letters of Credit were issued at a time when
      the conditions set forth in Section 2.2 were satisfied or waived,
      such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of, and Letter
      of Credit disbursements owed to, all Non-Defaulting Banks on a pro
      rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of, or
      Letter of Credit disbursements owed to, such Defaulting Bank until
      such time as all Loans and funded and unfunded participations in
      Letter of Credit obligations and Swing Line Loans are held by the
      Banks pro rata in accordance with the Commitments under the
      applicable facility without giving effect to Section 2.8(1)(d). Any
      payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a
      Defaulting Bank that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a
      Defaulting Bank or to post Cash Collateral pursuant to this Section
      2.8(1)(b) shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting
      Bank, and each Bank (including such Defaulting Bank) irrevocably
      consents hereto.




NAI-1502980324v12

36

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      (c)    Certain Fees.


(A)    No Defaulting Bank shall be entitled to receive any commitment fee 
for any period during which that Bank is a Defaulting Bank (and Borrower 
shall not be required to pay any such fee that otherwise would have been 
required to have been paid to that Defaulting Bank).


(B)    Each Defaulting Bank shall be entitled to receive Letter of Credit 
Fees for any period during which that Bank is a Defaulting Bank only to the 
extent allocable to its applicable percentage of the stated amount of 
Letters of Credit for which it has provided Cash Collateral pursuant to 
Section 2.8(1)(b).


(C)    With respect to any commitment fee or Letter of Credit Fees not 
required to be paid to any Defaulting Bank pursuant to clause (A) or (B) 
above, Borrower shall (x) pay to each Non-Defaulting Bank that portion of 
any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Bank with respect to such 
Defaulting Bank’s participation in Letter of Credit obligations or Swing 
Line Loans that has been reallocated to such Non-Defaulting Bank pursuant 
to clause (d) below, (y) pay to each Fronting Bank and Swing Line Lender, 
as applicable, the amount of any such fee otherwise payable to such 
Defaulting Bank to the extent allocable to such Fronting Bank’s or Swing 
Line Lender’s Fronting Exposure to such Defaulting Bank, and (z) not be 
required to pay the remaining amount of any such fee.


      (d)    Reallocation of Participations to Reduce Fronting Exposure.
      All or any part of such Defaulting Bank’s participation in Letter of
      Credit obligations and Swing Line Loans shall be reallocated among
      the Non-Defaulting Banks in accordance with their respective
      applicable percentages (calculated without regard to such Defaulting
      Bank’s Commitment) but only to the extent that (x) the conditions set
      forth in Section 2.2 are satisfied at the time of such reallocation
      (and, unless Borrower shall have otherwise notified the Agent at such
      time, Borrower shall be deemed to have represented and warranted that
      such conditions are satisfied at such time), and (y) such
      reallocation does not cause the aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure
      of any Non-Defaulting Bank to exceed such Non-Defaulting Bank’s
      Revolving Credit Commitment. Subject to Section 10.22, no
      reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any
      claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Bank arising from
      that Bank having become a Defaulting Bank, including any claim of a
      Non-Defaulting Bank as a result of such Non-Defaulting Bank’s
      increased exposure following such reallocation.


      (e)    Cash Collateral, Repayment of Swing Line Loans. If the
      reallocation described in clause (d) above cannot, or can only
      partially, be effected, Borrower shall, without prejudice to any
      right or remedy available to it hereunder or under law, (x) first,
      prepay Swing Line Loans in an amount equal to the Swing Line Lenders’
      Fronting Exposure and (y) second, Cash Collateralize the Fronting
      Banks’ Fronting Exposure in accordance with the procedures set forth
      in Section 2.8(1)(b).


      2.    Defaulting Bank Cure. If Borrower, the Agent and the Swing Line
      Lender and Fronting Bank agree in writing that a Bank is no longer a
      Defaulting Bank, the Agent will so notify the parties hereto,
      whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and
      subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include
      arrangements with respect to




NAI-1502980324v12

37

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      any Cash Collateral), that Bank will, to the extent applicable,
      purchase at par that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Banks
      or take such other actions as the Agent may determine to be necessary
      to cause the Loans and funded and unfunded participations in Letters
      of Credit and Swing Line Loans to be held pro rata by the Banks in
      accordance with the Commitment Percentages (without giving effect to 
      Section 2.8(1)(d), whereupon such Bank will cease to be a Defaulting
      Bank; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with
      respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of Borrower
      while that Bank was a Defaulting Bank; and provided, further, that
      except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected
      parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Bank to Bank will
      constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder
      arising from that Bank’s having been a Defaulting Bank.


New Swing Line Loans/Letters of Credit. So long as any Bank is a Defaulting 
Bank, (i) the Swing Line Lender shall not be required to fund any Swing 
Line Loans unless it is satisfied that it will have no Fronting Exposure 
after giving effect to such Swing Line Loan and (ii) no Fronting Bank shall 
be required to issue, extend, renew or increase any Letter of Credit unless 
it is satisfied that it will have no Fronting Exposure after giving effect 
thereto.


ARTICLE III.


ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS RELATING TO
LIBOR LOANS; INCREASED CAPITAL; TAXES.


SECTION 3.1    RESERVES OR DEPOSIT REQUIREMENTS, ETC. If, at any time, 
there is a Change in Law, and the result of the foregoing is to increase 
the cost (whether by incurring a cost or adding to a cost) to a Bank of 
making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any LIBOR Loan, or to 
increase the cost to a Bank or the Fronting Bank of participating in, 
issuing, or maintaining any Letter of Credit (or maintaining its obligation 
to participate in or to issue any Letter of Credit), or to reduce the 
amount of any sum (whether principal, interest or any other amount) 
received or receivable by a Bank or the Fronting Bank with respect to a 
LIBOR Loan, then, upon demand by such Bank, Borrower shall pay to such Bank 
from time to time on Interest Adjustment Dates with respect to such LIBOR 
Loan, as additional consideration hereunder, additional amounts sufficient 
to fully compensate and indemnify such Bank for such increased cost or 
reduced amount, assuming (which assumption such Bank need not corroborate) 
such additional cost or reduced amount was allocable to such LIBOR Loan. A 
certificate as to the increased cost or reduced amount as a result of any 
event mentioned in this Section 3.1, setting forth the calculations 
therefor, shall be promptly submitted by such Bank to Borrower and shall, 
in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding as to the 
amount thereof. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, 
after any such demand for compensation by any Bank, Borrower, upon at least 
three (3) Business Days’ prior written notice to such Bank through Agent, 
may prepay any affected LIBOR Loan in full or convert such LIBOR Loan to a 
Base Rate Loan regardless of the Interest Period thereof. Any such 
prepayment or conversion shall be accompanied by any amount required to be 
paid pursuant to Sections 3.4 and 3.8 hereof. Each Bank shall notify 
Borrower as promptly as practicable (with a copy thereof delivered to 
Agent) of the existence of any event that will likely require the payment 
by Borrower of any such additional amount under this Section 3.1.

SECTION 3.2    TAXES.


A.    Defined Terms. For purposes of this Section 3.2, the term “Bank” 
includes any Fronting Bank and the term “applicable law” includes FATCA.


B.    Payments Free of Taxes. Any and all payments by or on account of any 
obligation of any Credit Party under any Loan Document shall be made 
without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by 
applicable law. If any applicable law (as determined in the good faith 
discretion of an applicable Withholding Agent) requires the deduction or 
withholding of any Tax from any such payment by a Withholding Agent, then 
the applicable Withholding Agent shall be entitled to make such deduction 
or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to 
the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law and, 
if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the applicable 
Credit Party shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction 
or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings 
applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 3.2) the 
applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have 
received had no such deduction or withholding been made.


C.    Payment of Other Taxes by Borrower. The Credit Parties shall timely 
pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable 
law, or at the option of Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any 
Other Taxes.


D.    Indemnification by Borrower. The Credit Parties shall jointly and 
severally indemnify each Recipient, within 10 days after demand therefor, 
for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes 
imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this 
Section 3.2) payable or paid by such Recipient or required to be withheld 
or deducted from a payment to such Recipient and any reasonable expenses 
arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified 
Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant 
Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or 
liability delivered to Borrower by a Bank (with a copy to Agent), or by 
Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Bank, shall be conclusive absent 
manifest error.


E.    Indemnification by the Banks. Each Bank shall severally indemnify 
Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes 
attributable to such Bank (but only to the extent that any Credit Party has 
not already indemnified Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without 
limiting the obligation of the Credit Parties to do so), (ii) any Taxes 
attributable to such Bank’s failure to comply with the provisions of 
Section 10.11 relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and 
(iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Bank, in each case, that are 
payable or paid by Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any 
reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or 
not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the 
relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such 
payment or liability delivered to any Bank by Agent shall be conclusive 
absent manifest error. Each Bank hereby authorizes Agent to set off and 
apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Bank under any Loan 
Document or otherwise payable by Agent to the Bank from any other source 
against any amount due to Agent under this paragraph (E).




NAI-1502980324v12

39

------------------------------------------------------------------------


F.    Evidence of Payments. As soon as practicable after any payment of 
Taxes by any Credit Party to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this 
Section 3.2, such Credit Party shall deliver to Agent the original or a 
certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority 
evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or 
other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to Agent.


G.    Status of Banks. 1. Any Bank that is entitled to an exemption from or 
reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan 
Document shall deliver to Borrower and Agent, at the time or times 
reasonably requested by Borrower or Agent and at the time or times 
prescribed by applicable Law, such properly completed and executed 
documentation reasonably requested by Borrower or Agent as will permit such 
payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of 
withholding. In addition, any Bank, if reasonably requested by Borrower or 
Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable Law 
or reasonably requested by Borrower or Agent as will enable Borrower or 
Agent to determine whether or not such Bank is subject to backup 
withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything 
to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution 
and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set 
forth in Section 3.2G(2)(a), (b) and (d) below) shall not be required if in 
the Bank’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission 
would subject such Bank to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or 
would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Bank.


      2.    Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event
      that Borrower is a U.S. Person,


      (a)    any Bank that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to Borrower and
      Agent on or prior to the date on which such Bank becomes a Bank under
      this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable
      request of Borrower or Agent), executed originals of IRS Form W-9
      certifying that such Bank is exempt from U.S. federal backup
      withholding Tax;


      (b)    any Foreign Bank shall, to the extent it is legally entitled
      to do so, deliver to Borrower and Agent (in such number of copies as
      shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which
      such Foreign Bank becomes a Bank under this Agreement (and from time
      to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of Borrower or Agent),
      whichever of the following is applicable:


(i)    in the case of a Foreign Bank claiming the benefits of an income tax 
treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments 
of interest under any Loan Document, executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN 
or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable, establishing an exemption from, or 
reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “interest” 
article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable 
payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, as 
applicable, establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal 
withholding Tax pursuant to the “business profits” or “other income” 
article of such tax treaty;


(ii)    executed originals of IRS Form W-8ECI;




NAI-1502980324v12

40

------------------------------------------------------------------------


(iii)    in the case of a Foreign Bank claiming the benefits of the 
exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a 
certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit L-1 to the effect that 
such Foreign Bank is not a “bank” within the meaning of Section 
881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a “10 percent shareholder” of Borrower within the 
meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a “controlled foreign 
corporation” described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a “U.S. Tax 
Compliance Certificate”) and (y) executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN or 
IRS Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable; or


(iv)    to the extent a Foreign Bank is not the beneficial owner, executed 
originals of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form 
W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable, a U.S. Tax Compliance 
Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit L-2 or Exhibit L-3, IRS 
Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, 
as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Bank is a partnership and one 
or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Bank are claiming the 
portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Bank may provide a U.S. Tax 
Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit L-4 on behalf 
of each such direct and indirect partner;


      (c)    any Foreign Bank shall, to the extent it is legally entitled
      to do so, deliver to Borrower and Agent (in such number of copies as
      shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which
      such Foreign Bank becomes a Bank under this Agreement (and from time
      to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of Borrower or Agent),
      executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable law as
      a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal
      withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary
      documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit
      Borrower or Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required
      to be made; and


      (d)    if a payment made to a Bank under any Loan Document would be
      subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Bank
      were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of
      FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the
      Code, as applicable), such Bank shall deliver to Borrower and Agent
      at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times
      reasonably requested by Borrower or Agent such documentation
      prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section
      1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation
      reasonably requested by Borrower or Agent as may be necessary for
      Borrower and Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and
      to determine that such Bank has complied with such Bank’s obligations
      under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from
      such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (d), “FATCA” shall
      include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this
      Agreement.


Each Bank agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered 
expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update 
such form or certification or promptly notify Borrower and Agent in writing 
of its legal inability to do so.


      3.    For purposes of determining withholding Taxes imposed under
      FATCA, from and after the Effective Date of this Agreement, Borrower
      and Agent shall treat (and each Bank hereby authorizes Agent to
      treat) the Loans as not qualifying as “grandfathered obligations”
      within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1471-2(b)(2)(i).




NAI-1502980324v12

------------------------------------------------------------------------


H.    Treatment of Certain Refunds. If any party receives a refund of any 
Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section 3.2 
(including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section 
3.2), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund 
(but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section 3.2 
with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all 
out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such indemnified party and 
without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental 
Authority with respect to such refund). Such indemnifying party, upon the 
request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party 
the amount paid over pursuant to this paragraph (H) (plus any penalties, 
interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) 
in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund 
to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in 
this paragraph (H), in no event will the indemnified party be required to 
pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this paragraph (H) to 
the extent that the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a 
less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have 
been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such 
refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the 
indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had 
never been paid. This paragraph shall not be construed to require any 
indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other 
information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the 
indemnifying party or any other Person.


I.    Survival. Each party’s obligations under this Section 3.2 shall 
survive the resignation or replacement of Agent or any assignment of rights 
by, or the replacement of, a Bank, the termination of the Commitments and 
the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan 
Document.


SECTION 3.3    EURODOLLAR DEPOSITS UNAVAILABLE OR INTEREST RATE 
UNASCERTAINABLE. In respect of any LIBOR Loan, in the event that Agent 
shall have determined that dollar deposits of the relevant amount for the 
relevant Interest Period for such LIBOR Loan are not available to Agent in 
the applicable eurodollar market or that, by reason of circumstances 
affecting such market, adequate and reasonable means do not exist for 
ascertaining the LIBOR Rate applicable to such Interest Period, as the case 
may be, Agent shall promptly give notice of such determination to Borrower 
and (a) any notice of a new LIBOR Loan (or conversion of an existing Loan 
to a LIBOR Loan) previously given by Borrower and not yet borrowed (or 
converted, as the case may be) shall be deemed a notice to make a Base Rate 
Loan, and (b) Borrower shall be obligated either to prepay, or to convert 
to a Base Rate Loan, any outstanding LIBOR Loan on the last day of the then 
current Interest Period with respect thereto.


SECTION 3.4    INDEMNITY. Without prejudice to any other provisions of this 
Article III and without duplication of any amounts paid by Borrower under 
Section 3.8, Borrower hereby agrees to indemnify each Bank against any loss 
or expense that such Bank may sustain or incur as a consequence of (a) any 
default by Borrower in payment when due of any amount hereunder in respect 
of any LIBOR Loan, or (b) the failure by Borrower to consummate the 
borrowing of any LIBOR Loan after making a request therefor, including, but 
not limited to, any loss of profit, premium or penalty incurred by such 
Bank in respect of funds borrowed by it for the purpose of making or 
maintaining such LIBOR Loan, as determined by such Bank in the exercise of 
its sole but reasonable discretion. A certificate as to any such loss or 
expense shall be promptly submitted by such Bank




NAI-1502980324v12

42

------------------------------------------------------------------------


to Borrower and shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and 
binding as to the amount thereof.


SECTION 3.5    CHANGES IN LAW RENDERING LIBOR LOANS UNLAWFUL. If at any 
time there is a Change in Law, which shall make it unlawful for any Bank to 
fund any LIBOR Loan that it is committed to make hereunder with moneys 
obtained in the eurodollar market, the commitment of such Bank to fund such 
LIBOR Loan shall, upon the happening of such event forthwith be suspended 
for the duration of such illegality, and such Bank shall by written notice 
to Borrower and Agent declare that its commitment with respect to such 
LIBOR Loan has been so suspended and, if and when such illegality ceases to 
exist, such suspension shall cease and such Bank shall similarly notify 
Borrower and Agent. If any such Change in Law shall make it unlawful for 
any Bank to continue in effect the funding in the applicable eurodollar 
market of any LIBOR Loan previously made by it hereunder, such Bank shall, 
upon the happening of such event, notify Borrower, Agent and the other 
Banks thereof in writing stating the reasons therefor, and Borrower shall, 
on the earlier of (a) the last day of the then current Interest Period or 
(b) if required by such law, regulation or interpretation, on such date as 
shall be specified in such notice, either convert such LIBOR Loan to a Base 
Rate Loan or prepay such LIBOR Loan to the Banks in full. Any such 
prepayment or conversion shall be accompanied by any amount required to be 
paid pursuant to Sections 3.4 and 3.8 hereof.


SECTION 3.6    FUNDING. Each Bank may, but shall not be required to, make 
LIBOR Loans hereunder with funds obtained outside the United States.


SECTION 3.7    CAPITAL ADEQUACY. If any Bank shall have determined, after 
the Effective Date, there is a Change in Law regarding capital or liquidity 
requirements, which has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of 
return on such Bank’s capital (or the capital of its holding company) as a 
consequence of its obligations hereunder to a level below that which such 
Bank (or its holding company) could have achieved but for such adoption, 
change or compliance (taking into consideration such Bank’s policies or the 
policies of its holding company with respect to capital adequacy) by an 
amount deemed by such Bank to be material, then from time to time, within 
ten (10) days after demand by such Bank (with a copy to Agent), Borrower 
shall pay to such Bank such additional amount or amounts as shall 
compensate such Bank (or its holding company) for such reduction. A 
certificate of any Bank claiming compensation under this Section 3.7 and 
setting forth the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder 
shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. In determining such 
amount, such Bank may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods. 
Failure on the part of any Bank to demand compensation for any reduction in 
return on capital with respect to any period shall not constitute a waiver 
of such Bank’s rights to demand compensation for any reduction in return on 
capital in such period or in any other period. The protection of this 
Section 3.7 shall be available to each Bank regardless of any possible 
contention of the invalidity or inapplicability of the law, regulation or 
other condition that shall have been imposed.


SECTION 3.8    BREAKAGE COMPENSATION. Without duplication of any amounts 
paid by Borrower under Section 3.4, Borrower shall compensate each Bank 
(including the Swing Line Lender), upon its written request (which request 
shall set forth the detailed basis for requesting and the method of 
calculating such compensation), for all reasonable losses, costs, expenses 
and




NAI-1502980324v12

43

------------------------------------------------------------------------


liabilities (including, without limitation, any loss, cost, expense or 
liability incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits 
or other funds required by such Bank to fund its LIBOR Loans or Swing Line 
Loans) which such Bank may sustain in connection with any of the following: 
(i) if for any reason (other than a default by such Bank or Agent) a 
borrowing of LIBOR Loans or Swing Line Loans does not occur on a date 
specified therefor in a Notice of Loan (whether or not withdrawn by 
Borrower); (ii) if any repayment, prepayment, conversion or continuation of 
any LIBOR Loan occurs on a date that is not the last day of an Interest 
Period applicable thereto; (iii) if any prepayment of any of its LIBOR 
Loans is not made on any date specified in a notice of prepayment given by 
Borrower; (iv) as a result of an assignment by a Bank of any LIBOR Loan 
other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto 
pursuant to a request by Borrower pursuant to Section 3.9; or (v) as a 
consequence of (y) any other default by Borrower to repay or prepay any 
LIBOR Loans when required by the terms of this Agreement or (z) an election 
made pursuant to Section 3.9. The written request of any Bank setting forth 
any amount or amounts that such Bank is entitled to receive pursuant to 
this Section 3.8 shall be delivered to Borrower and shall be conclusive 
absent manifest error. Borrower shall pay such Bank the amount shown as due 
on any such request within 10 days after receipt thereof.


SECTION 3.9    CHANGE OF LENDING OFFICE; REPLACEMENT OF BANKS.


A.    Each Bank agrees that, upon the occurrence of any event giving rise 
to the operation of Section 3.1, 3.5 or 3.7 requiring the payment of 
additional amounts to the Bank, such Bank will, if requested by Borrower, 
use reasonable efforts (subject to overall policy considerations of such 
Bank) to designate another Applicable Lending Office for any Loans or 
Commitments affected by such event; provided, however, that such 
designation is made on such terms that such Bank and its Applicable Lending 
Office suffer, in the judgment of such Bank, no economic, legal or 
regulatory disadvantage, with the object of avoiding the consequence of the 
event giving rise to the operation of any such Section. Borrower hereby 
agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Bank in 
connection with any such designation or assignment.


B.    If (i) any Bank requests any compensation, reimbursement or other 
payment under Section 3.1, 3.5 or 3.7  with respect to such Bank, (ii) 
Borrower is, or because of a matter in existence as of the date that 
Borrower is seeking to exercise its rights under this Section 3.9 will be, 
required to pay any additional amount to any Bank or Governmental Authority 
pursuant to Section 3.2 (including any withholding Tax resulting from a 
Bank’s failure to comply with FATCA, as that term is used in Section 
3.2G(2)(d)), or (iii) if any Bank is a Defaulting Bank, then Borrower may, 
at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Bank and the Agent, 
require such Bank to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance 
with the restrictions contained in Section 10.10), all its interests, 
rights and obligations under this Agreement to an Eligible Assignee that 
shall assume such obligations; provided, however, that (1) Borrower shall 
have received the prior written consent of the Agent, which consent shall 
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, (2) such Bank shall 
have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of 
its Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts 
then payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such 
outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or Borrower (in the 
case of all other amounts, but excluding any breakage compensation), (3) in 
the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation, 
reimbursement or other payments required to be made under Section 3.1 or 
3.5 with respect to such Bank, or resulting from any required payments




NAI-1502980324v12

44

------------------------------------------------------------------------


to any Bank or Governmental Authority pursuant to Section 3.2, such 
assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation, reimbursement 
or payments and (4) such Assignment does not conflict with applicable Law. 
A Bank shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, 
prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Bank or otherwise, the 
circumstances entitling Borrower to require such assignment and delegation 
cease to apply.


C.    Nothing in this Section 3.9 shall affect or postpone any of the 
obligations of Borrower or the right of any Bank provided in this Article 
III.

      immediately subsequent fiscal quarters ending after the consummation
      of any Material Acquisition (each such period, a “Leverage Ratio
      Increase Period”) to be greater than 3.00 to 1.00 but less than or

Indebtedness in an original principal amount of $5,000,000 or more contains 
a Leverage Ratio, Interest Coverage Ratio or other financial covenant more 
restrictive than contained in this Section 5.7 (a “More Restrictive 
Covenant”), this Agreement shall be deemed to have been amended to include 
such More Restrictive Covenant (including any amendments thereto that are 
more restrictive than the initial More Restrictive Covenant) in place of or 
in addition to the covenants contained herein as of the date such More 
Restrictive Covenant first became binding on Borrower; provided, however, 
that so long as no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be 
continuing (i) upon (x) the satisfaction of all Indebtedness evidenced by 
or incurred pursuant to any such Material Indebtedness Agreement and (y) 
effective upon the delivery of a Compliance Certificate in accordance with 
Section 5.3(c) for the period in which such Indebtedness has been satisfied 
in full, reflecting compliance with such More Restrictive Covenant during 
such period, any such covenant so incorporated herein shall be deemed 
deleted and the provisions hereof shall thereupon be those in effect prior 
to the date such More Restrictive Covenant first became binding on 
Borrower, (ii) upon (x) the amendment of any More Restrictive Covenant by 
the holder of such Indebtedness in a manner that is less restrictive, but 
remains more restrictive than contained in this Section 5.7 as of the date 
immediately prior to the date such More Restrictive Covenant became 
effective hereunder (an “Amended More Restrictive Covenant”) and (y) 
effective upon the delivery of a Compliance Certificate in accordance with 
Section 5.3(c) for the period in which such Amended More Restrictive 
Covenant is to become binding on Borrower, reflecting compliance with such 
More Restrictive Covenant during such period, this Agreement shall be 
deemed to include such Amended More Restrictive Covenant and the More 
Restrictive Covenant amended by such Amended More Restrictive Covenant 
shall be deemed deleted, and (iii) upon (x) the amendment of any More 
Restrictive Covenant or Amended More Restrictive Covenant in a manner that 
is less restrictive than contained in this Section 5.7 and (y) effective 
upon the delivery of a Compliance Certificate in accordance with Section 
5.3(c) for the period in which such amendment is to become binding on 
Borrower, reflecting compliance with such More Restrictive Covenant or 
Amended More Restrictive Covenant during such period, any such covenant so 
incorporated herein shall be deemed deleted and the provisions hereof shall 
thereupon be those in effect prior to the date such More Restrictive 
Covenant first became binding on Borrower.

to such Restricted Payment, of less than or equal to 2.50 to 1.00; 
provided that for the purposes of calculating compliance with respect to 
clause (ii) above, (x) if, as of the date of such Restricted Payment, the 
Borrower has delivered a Compliance Certificate pursuant to Section 5.3(c) 
for the immediately preceding fiscal quarter, then compliance on a pro 
forma basis shall be based on the most recently delivered Compliance 
Certificate, and (y) if, as of the date of such Restricted Payment, the 
Borrower has not delivered a Compliance Certificate pursuant to Section 
5.3(c) for the immediately preceding fiscal quarter, then the Borrower 
shall deliver a Compliance Certificate in the form of Exhibit D, based on 
the financial statements most recently delivered pursuant to Section 5.3(a)
 or Section 5.3(b), substantially simultaneously with the making

of such Restricted Payment, and compliance on a pro forma basis shall be 
based on such Compliance Certificate; and


B.    If the Borrower has a pro forma Leverage Ratio, after giving effect 
to the items described in clauses (i) and (ii) below, of greater than 2.50 
to 1.00, then the Borrower and its Subsidiaries may, so long as no Event of 
Default has occurred and is continuing, effect (i) unlimited mandatory 
repurchases, redemptions, acquisitions, cancellations or other retirement 
for value of the Equity Interests in the Borrower or its Subsidiaries or to 
effect the termination of options to purchase Equity Interests of the 
Borrower, in each instance, held by former or current directors, officers 
and employees (or their estates, spouses or former spouses) of the Borrower 
or any Credit Party upon their death, disability, retirement or termination 
of employment and (ii) voluntary repurchases, redemptions, acquisitions, 
cancellations or other retirement for value of the Equity Interests in the 
Borrower or its Subsidiaries or to effect the termination of options to 
purchase Equity Interests of the Borrower, in each instance, held by former 
or current directors, officers and employees (or their estates, spouses or 
former spouses) of the Borrower or any Credit Party upon their death, 
disability, retirement or termination of employment for a maximum cash 
consideration not to exceed Thirty Million Dollars ($30,000,000) in any 
fiscal year.


SECTION 5.15    NOTICE. Borrower shall cause a Financial Officer of 
Borrower to promptly notify Agent and the Banks whenever any Default or 
Event of Default may occur hereunder or any representation or warranty made 
in Article VI hereof or elsewhere in this Agreement or in any Related 
Writing may for any reason cease in any material respect to be true and 
complete.


SECTION 5.16    ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE. Each Company shall comply in all 
material respects with any and all Environmental Laws including, without 
limitation, all Environmental Laws in jurisdictions in which any Company 
owns or operates a facility or site, arranges for disposal or treatment of 
hazardous substances, solid waste or other wastes, accepts for transport 
any hazardous substances, solid waste or other wastes or holds any interest 
in real property or otherwise. Borrower shall furnish to the Banks, 
promptly after receipt thereof, a copy of any notice any Company may 
receive from any governmental authority, private Person or otherwise that 
any material litigation or proceeding pertaining to any environmental, 
health or safety matter has been filed or is threatened against such 
Company, any real property in which such Company holds any interest or any 
past or present operation of such Company. No Company shall allow the 
release or disposal of any material amount of hazardous waste, solid waste 
or other wastes on, under or to any real property in which any Company 
holds any interest or performs any of its operations, in violation of any 
Environmental Law. With respect to any violation by any Company of any 
Environmental Law existing on the Effective Date or, so long as Borrower 
shall have provided notice to Agent, any violation by any Company of any 
Environmental Law that arises after the Effective Date, such Company shall 
comply in all material respects with any consent order or other remediation 
plan. As used in this Section 5.16, “litigation or proceeding” means any 
demand, claim, notice, suit, suit in equity action, administrative action, 
investigation or inquiry whether brought by any governmental authority, 
private Person or otherwise. Borrower shall defend, indemnify and hold 
Agent and the Banks harmless against all costs, expenses, claims, damages, 
penalties and liabilities of every kind or nature whatsoever (including 
reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or resulting from the 
noncompliance of any Company with any Environmental Law. Such 
indemnification shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

SECTION 5.17    AFFILIATE TRANSACTIONS. No Company shall, or shall permit 
any Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, enter into or permit to exist 
any material transaction (including, without limitation, the purchase, 
sale, lease or exchange of any property or the rendering of any service) 
with any Affiliate of a Company on terms that are less favorable to such 
Company or such Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that might be 
obtained at the time in a transaction with a non-Affiliate; provided, 
however, that the foregoing shall not prohibit the payment of customary and 
reasonable directors’ fees to directors who are not employees of a Company 
or any Affiliate of a Company or any transaction permitted under Sections 
5.11, 5.12 or 5.13.


SECTION 5.18    USE OF PROCEEDS. Borrower’s use of the proceeds of the 
Notes shall be solely for refinancing the A&R Credit Agreement, working 
capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes of 
Borrower and its Subsidiaries. The Borrower will not, directly or 
indirectly, use the proceeds of the Loans, or lend, contribute or otherwise 
make available such proceeds to any Subsidiary, joint venture partner or 
other Person, to fund any activities or business of or with any Person, or 
in any country or territory, that, at the time of such funding, is, or 
whose government is, the subject of Sanctions.


SECTION 5.19    CORPORATE NAMES. No Company shall change its corporate 
name, unless, in each case, Borrower shall provide each Bank with ten (10) 
days prior written notice thereof.


SECTION 5.20    MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS. No Company shall make or enter into 
any so-called management agreement whereby management, supervision or 
control of its business, or any of the principal functions of any Company 
shall be delegated to any Person other than its duly elected Board of 
Directors.


SECTION 5.21    SUBSIDIARY GUARANTIES. Each Subsidiary (other than a 
Receivables Subsidiary) of a Company created, acquired or held subsequent 
to the Effective Date shall immediately execute and deliver to Agent a 
Guaranty of Payment of all of the Debt, such agreement to be in form and 
substance acceptable to Agent and the Required Banks, along with such 
corporate governance and authorization documents and an opinion of counsel 
as may be deemed necessary or advisable by Agent and the Required Banks; 
provided, however, that (a) the Insurance Subsidiary shall not be required 
to execute and deliver a Guaranty of Payment, (b) a Subsidiary shall not be 
required to execute such Guaranty of Payment so long as (i) the book value 
of the total assets of such Subsidiary is less than One Million Dollars 
($1,000,000), (ii) the aggregate of the total assets of all such 
Subsidiaries with total asset values of less than One Million Dollars 
($1,000,000) does not exceed the aggregate amount of Five Million Dollars 
($5,000,000), and (iii) the amount of total net sales of such Subsidiary is 
less than One Million Dollars ($1,000,000); and (c) a Foreign Subsidiary 
shall not be required to execute a Guaranty of Payment to the extent that 
such Guaranty of Payment will result in adverse tax consequences for 
Borrower or any U.S. Subsidiary. In the event that the book value of the 
total assets and/or the amount of total net sales of any Subsidiary (other 
than the Insurance Subsidiary and any Receivables Subsidiary) that is not a 
Guarantor of Payment are at any time equal to or greater than One Million 
Dollars ($1,000,000), Borrower shall provide Agent and the Banks with 
prompt written notice of such asset value.

SECTION 5.22    KEEPWELL. Borrower, to the extent it is a Qualified ECP 
Guarantor, hereby, and each Qualified ECP Guarantor hereby jointly and 
severally, absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably undertakes to 
provide such funds or other support as may be needed from time to time by a 
Guarantor of Payment to honor all of its obligations under any Guaranty of 
Payment in respect of Designated Hedge Agreements (provided, however, that 
Borrower and each Qualified ECP Guarantor shall only be liable under this 
Section 5.22 for the maximum amount of such liability that can be hereby 
incurred without rendering its obligations under this Section 5.22, or 
otherwise under any Guaranty of Payment, voidable under applicable law 
relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer, and not for any 
greater amount). The obligations of the Company under this Section 5.22 
shall remain in full force and effect until payment in full of all of the 
Obligations and the termination of the Commitments hereunder. Borrower and 
each Qualified ECP Guarantor intends that this Section 5.22 constitute, and 
this Section 5.22 shall be deemed to constitute, a “keepwell, support, or 
other agreement” for the benefit of each other Credit Party for all 
purposes of Section 1a(18)(A)(v)(II) of the Commodity Exchange Act.


SECTION 5.23    ANTI-TERRORISM LAW.


      (a)    None of the Credit Parties is or shall be (i) a Person with
      whom any Bank is restricted from doing business under Executive Order
      No. 13224 or any other Anti-Terrorism Law, (ii) engaged in any
      business involved in making or receiving any contribution of funds,
      goods or services to or for the benefit of such a Person or in any
      transaction that evades or avoids, or has the purpose of evading or
      avoiding, the prohibitions set forth in any Anti-Terrorism Law, or
      (iii) otherwise in violation of any Anti-Terrorism Law. The Credit
      Parties shall provide to the Agent and any Bank any certification or
      information that the Agent or a Bank reasonably requests to confirm
      compliance by the Credit Parties with Anti-Terrorism Laws.


      (b)    Borrower shall ensure that each Credit Party has implemented
      or, shall implement within a reasonable amount of time, and maintain
      in effect policies and procedures intended to ensure compliance in
      all material respects by such Credit Party and its directors,
      officers, employees and agents with Anti-Terrorism Laws,
      Anti-Corruption Laws and applicable Sanctions.


ARTICLE VI.


REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES


Borrower represents and warrants that the statements set forth in this 
Article VI are true, correct and complete.


SECTION 6.1    CORPORATE EXISTENCE; SUBSIDIARIES; FOREIGN QUALIFICATION. 
Each Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing, and in good 
standing under the laws of its state of incorporation and is duly qualified 
and authorized to do business and is in good standing as a foreign 
corporation in the jurisdictions where the character of its property or its 
business activities makes such qualification necessary, except where the 
failure to so qualify will not cause or result in a Material Adverse 
Effect. Schedule 6.1 hereto sets forth, as of the Effective Date, each 
Subsidiary of Borrower, its state of incorporation, the location of its




NAI-1502980324v12

57

------------------------------------------------------------------------


chief executive offices, its principal place of business and the 
jurisdictions where it is qualified as a foreign corporation. Borrower owns 
all of the capital stock of each of its Subsidiaries.


SECTION 6.2    CORPORATE AUTHORITY. Borrower has the right and power and is 
duly authorized and empowered to enter into, execute and deliver the Loan 
Documents to which it is a party and to perform and observe the provisions 
of the Loan Documents. The Loan Documents to which Borrower is a party have 
been duly authorized and approved by Borrower’s Board of Directors and are 
the valid and binding obligations of Borrower, enforceable against Borrower 
in accordance with their respective terms. The execution, delivery and 
performance of the Loan Documents will not conflict with nor result in any 
breach in any of the provisions of, or constitute a default under, or 
result in the creation of any Lien (other than Liens permitted under 
Section 5.9 of this Agreement) upon any assets or property of Borrower 
under the provisions of, Borrower’s Organizational Documents or any 
agreement.


SECTION 6.3    COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS. Each Company:


      (a)    holds all material permits, certificates, licenses, orders,
      registrations, franchises, authorizations, and other approvals from
      federal, state, local, and foreign governmental and regulatory bodies
      necessary for the conduct of its business and is in compliance with
      all applicable laws relating thereto;


      (b)    is in compliance with all material federal, state, local, or
      foreign applicable statutes, rules, regulations, and orders
      including, without limitation, those relating to environmental
      protection, occupational safety and health, and equal employment
      practices; and


      (c)    is not in violation of or in default under any material
      agreement to which it is a party or by which its assets are subject
      or bound.


SECTION 6.4    LITIGATION AND ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS. Except as 
disclosed on Schedule 6.4 hereto, to the best of Borrower’s knowledge, 
there are (a) no lawsuits, actions, investigations, or other proceedings 
pending or threatened against any Company, or in respect of which any 
Company may have any liability, in any court or before any governmental 
authority, arbitration board, or other tribunal, (b) no orders, writs, 
injunctions, judgments, or decrees of any court or government agency or 
instrumentality to which any Company is a party or by which the property or 
assets of any Company are bound, and (c) no grievances, disputes, or 
controversies outstanding with any union or other organization of the 
employees of any Company, or threats of work stoppage, strike, or pending 
demands for collective bargaining, which, as to subsections (a) through (c) 
above, would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on 
the business, operation or condition (financial or otherwise) of the 
Companies taken as a whole.




NAI-1502980324v12

58

------------------------------------------------------------------------


SECTION 6.5    TITLE TO ASSETS. Each Company has good title to and 
ownership of all property it purports to own, which property is free and 
clear of all Liens, except those permitted under Section 5.9 hereof.


SECTION 6.6    LIENS AND SECURITY INTERESTS. On and after the Effective 
Date, except for Liens permitted pursuant to Section 5.9 hereof, (a) there 
is no financing statement outstanding covering any personal property of any 
Company; (b) there is no mortgage outstanding covering any real property of 
any Company; and (c) no real or personal property of any Company is subject 
to any security interest or Lien of any kind. No Company has entered into 
any contract or agreement that exists on or after the Effective Date that 
would prohibit Agent or the Banks from acquiring a security interest, 
mortgage or other Lien on, or a collateral assignment of, any of the 
property or assets of any Company.


SECTION 6.7    TAX RETURNS. All federal, state and local Tax returns and 
other reports required by law to be filed in respect of the income, 
business, properties and employees of each Company have been filed and all 
Taxes, assessments, fees and other governmental charges that are due and 
payable have been paid, except for (i) those being contested in good faith 
by appropriate and timely proceedings or (ii) where the failure to do so 
does not and will not cause or result in a Material Adverse Effect. The 
provision for taxes on the books of each Company is adequate for all years 
not closed by applicable statutes and for the current fiscal year.


SECTION 6.8    ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS. Each Company is in material compliance 
with any and all Environmental Laws, including, without limitation, all 
Environmental Laws in all jurisdictions in which any Company owns or 
operates, or has owned or operated, a facility or site, arranges or has 
arranged for disposal or treatment of hazardous substances, solid waste or 
other wastes, accepts or has accepted for transport any hazardous 
substances, solid waste or other wastes or holds or has held any interest 
in real property or otherwise. No material litigation or proceeding arising 
under, relating to or in connection with any Environmental Law is pending 
or, to the best knowledge of each Company, threatened, against any Company, 
any real property in which any Company holds or has held an interest or any 
past or present operation of any Company. No release, threatened release or 
disposal of any material amount of hazardous waste, solid waste or other 
wastes is occurring, or has occurred (other than those that are currently 
being cleaned up in accordance with Environmental Laws), on, under or to 
any real property in which any Company holds any interest or performs any 
of its operations, in violation of any Environmental Law. As used in this 
Section 6.8, “litigation or proceeding” means any demand, claim, notice, 
suit, suit in equity, action, administrative action, investigation or 
inquiry whether brought by any governmental authority, private Person or 
otherwise.


SECTION 6.9    CONTINUED BUSINESS. There exists no actual, pending, or, to 
Borrower’s knowledge, any threatened termination, cancellation or 
limitation of, or any modification or change in the business relationship 
of any Company and any customer or supplier, or any group of customers or 
suppliers, whose purchases or supplies, if terminated, cancelled or limited 
would have a Material Adverse Effect, and there exists no present condition 
or state of facts or circumstances that would materially affect adversely 
any Company in any respect or prevent a Company from conducting such 
business or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in 
substantially the same manner in which it was previously conducted.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


SECTION 6.10    EMPLOYEE BENEFITS PLANS. Schedule 6.10 hereto identifies 
each ERISA Plan. Since the Effective Date, no ERISA Event has occurred or 
is expected to occur with respect to an ERISA Plan that could reasonably be 
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Full payment has been made of 
all amounts which a Controlled Group member is required, under applicable 
law or under the governing documents, to have been paid as a contribution 
to or a benefit under each ERISA Plan. The liability of each Controlled 
Group member with respect to each ERISA Plan has been funded based upon 
reasonable and proper actuarial assumptions and in accordance with 
applicable law, has been fully insured, or has been fully reserved for on 
its financial statements. No changes have occurred or are expected to occur 
that would cause a material increase in the cost of providing benefits 
under the ERISA Plan that could reasonably be expected to have a Material 
Adverse Effect. With respect to each ERISA Plan that is intended to be 
qualified under Code Section 401(a): (a) the ERISA Plan and any associated 
trust operationally comply with the applicable requirements of Code Section 
401(a), (b) the ERISA Plan and any associated trust have been amended to 
comply with all such requirements as currently in effect, other than those 
requirements for which a retroactive amendment can be made within the 
“remedial amendment period” available under Code Section 401(b) (as 
extended under Treasury Regulations and other Treasury pronouncements upon 
which taxpayers may rely), (c) the ERISA Plan and any associated trust have 
received a favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service 
stating that the ERISA Plan qualifies under Code Section 401(a), that the 
associated trust qualifies under Code Section 501(a) and, if applicable, 
that any employee stock ownership plan under the ERISA Plan qualifies under 
Code Section 4975(e)(7), unless the ERISA Plan was first adopted at a time 
for which the above-described “remedial amendment period” has not yet 
expired, (d) the ERISA Plan currently satisfies the requirements of Code 
Section 410(b), without regard to any retroactive amendment that may be 
made within the above-described “remedial amendment period”, and (e) no 
contribution made to the ERISA Plan is subject to an excise tax under Code 
Section 4972. With respect to all Pension Plans, the aggregate “accumulated 
benefit obligation” of Controlled Group members with respect to such 
Pension Plans (as determined in accordance with Statement of Accounting 
Standards No. 87, “Employers’ Accounting for Pensions”) does not exceed the 
aggregate fair market value of all Pension Plan assets by more than 15% of 
Consolidated Net Worth. If all Controlled Group members withdrew from all 
Multiemployer Plans in a “complete withdrawal” (within the meaning of ERISA 
Section 4203) such withdrawal would not reasonably be expected to result in 
a Material Adverse Effect.


SECTION 6.11    CONSENTS OR APPROVALS. No consent, approval or 
authorization of, or filing, registration or qualification with, any 
governmental authority or any other Person is required to be obtained or 
completed by Borrower in connection with the execution, delivery or 
performance of any of the Loan Documents, that has not already been 
obtained or completed.


SECTION 6.12    SOLVENCY. Borrower has received consideration that is the 
reasonable equivalent value of the obligations and liabilities that 
Borrower has incurred to the Banks. Borrower is not insolvent as defined in 
any applicable state or federal statute, nor will Borrower be rendered 
insolvent by the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents to Agent and 
the Banks. Borrower is not engaged or about to engage in any business or 
transaction for which the assets retained by it are or will be an 
unreasonably small amount of capital, taking into consideration the 
obligations to Agent and the Banks incurred hereunder. Borrower does not 
intend to, nor does it believe that it will, incur debts beyond its ability 
to pay such debts as they mature.




NAI-1502980324v12

60

------------------------------------------------------------------------


SECTION 6.13    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. The audited Consolidated financial 
statements of Borrower for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, and the 
unaudited Consolidated interim financial statements of Borrower for the 
fiscal quarters ended after March 31, 2017, and June 30, 2017, furnished to 
Agent and the Banks, are true and complete, have been prepared in 
accordance with GAAP, and fairly present the Companies’ financial condition 
as of the date of such financial statements and the results of their 
operations for the periods then ending. Since the date of such statements, 
there has been no material adverse change in any Company’s financial 
condition, properties or business nor any material change in any Company’s 
accounting procedures.


SECTION 6.14    REGULATIONS. Borrower is not engaged principally or as one 
of its important activities, in the business of extending credit for the 
purpose of purchasing or carrying any “margin stock” (within the meaning of 
Regulation U of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System of the 
United States of America). Neither the granting of any Loan (or any 
conversion thereof) nor the use of the proceeds of any Loan will violate, 
or be inconsistent with, the provisions of Regulation U or X of said Board 
of Governors.


SECTION 6.15    INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. Each Company owns, possesses, or has 
the right to use all of the patents, patent applications, trademarks, 
service marks, copyrights, licenses, and rights with respect to the 
foregoing necessary for the conduct of its business without any known 
conflict with the rights of others.


SECTION 6.16    INSURANCE. Each Company maintains with financially sound 
and reputable insurers insurance with coverage and limits as required by 
law and as is customary with persons engaged in the same businesses as the 
Companies.


SECTION 6.17    ACCURATE AND COMPLETE STATEMENTS. Neither the Loan 
Documents nor any written statement made by any Company in connection with 
any of the Loan Documents contains any untrue statement of a material fact 
or omits a material fact necessary to make the statements contained therein 
or in the Loan Documents not misleading. After due inquiry by Borrower, 
there is no known fact that any Company has not disclosed to Agent and the 
Banks that has or would have a Material Adverse Effect.


SECTION 6.18    DEFAULTS. No Default or Event of Default exists hereunder, 
nor will any begin to exist immediately after the execution and delivery 
hereof.


SECTION 6.19    ANTI-TERRORISM LAW, ANTI-CORRUPTION LAW AND SANCTIONS 
COMPLIANCE. Each Credit Party and each Subsidiary of each Credit Party and 
their respective officers and employees and, to the knowledge of the Credit 
Parties, their respective directors and agents that are Controlled by a 
Credit Party or its Subsidiaries, is and will remain in compliance in all 
material respects with all applicable Anti-Corruption Laws and Sanctions. 
No Credit Party and no Subsidiary of a Credit Party or any officer or 
employees or, to the knowledge of the Credit Parties, any of their 
respective directors or agents (i) is a Person designated by the U.S. 
government on the list of the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked 
Persons (the “SDN List”) with which a U.S. Person cannot deal with or 
otherwise engage in business transactions or is the subject of any 
list-based or territorial Sanctions maintained by the U.S. Department of 
the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), the U.S. 
Department of State, or the Global Affairs Canada, or by the United Nations 
Security Council, the European Union or any European

Union member state, or (ii) is controlled by (including without limitation 
by virtue of such person being a director or owning voting shares or 
interests), or acts, directly or indirectly, for or on behalf of, any 
person or entity on the SDN List or a foreign government that is the target 
of Sanctions such that the entry into, or performance under, this Agreement 
or any other Loan Document would be prohibited under U.S. law. The Credit 
Parties and each of their Subsidiaries are in compliance with (a) the 
Trading with the Enemy Act, and each of the foreign assets control 
regulations of the United States Treasury Department (31 CFR, Subtitle B 
Chapter V, as amended) and any other enabling legislation or executive 
order relating thereto, (b) the Patriot Act and (c) other federal or state 
laws relating to “know your customer” and anti-money laundering rules and 
regulations. No part of the proceeds of any Loan will be used directly or 
indirectly, in furtherance of an offer, payment, promise to pay, or 
authorization of the payment or giving of money, or anything else of value, 
to any government official or employee, political party, official of a 
political party, candidate for political office, or anyone else acting in 
an official capacity, in order to obtain, retain or direct business or 
obtain any improper advantage, in violation of any Anti-Corruption Laws.

Obligor’s part, as the case may be, to be complied with, and that Default 
shall not have been fully corrected within thirty (30) days after the 
giving of written notice thereof to Borrower by Agent or any Bank that the 
specified Default is to be remedied.


SECTION 7.4    REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. If any representation, 
warranty or statement made in or pursuant to this Agreement or any Related 
Writing or any other material information furnished by any Company or any 
Obligor to the Banks or any thereof or any other holder of any Note, shall 
be false or erroneous; provided that any information furnished in

SECTION 7.5    CROSS DEFAULT. If any Company or any Obligor shall default 
(a) in the payment of principal, interest or fees due and owing with 
respect to any Material Indebtedness Agreement beyond any period of grace 
provided with respect thereto, or (b) in the performance or observance of

acceleration of the maturity of such Indebtedness or to permit the holder 
thereof to cause such Indebtedness to become due prior to its stated 
maturity.


SECTION 7.6    ERISA DEFAULT. The occurrence of one or more ERISA Events 
that (a) the Required Banks determine could reasonably be expected to have 
a Material Adverse Effect, or (b) results in a Lien on any of the assets of

($500,000).


SECTION 7.7    CHANGE IN CONTROL. If any Change in Control shall occur.


SECTION 7.8    MONEY JUDGMENT. A final judgment or order for the payment of 
money shall be rendered against any Company or any Obligor by a court of 
competent jurisdiction, that remains unpaid or unstayed and undischarged 
for a period (during which execution shall not be effectively stayed) of 
thirty (30) days after the date on which the right to appeal has expired, 
provided that the aggregate of all such judgments for all such Companies 
and Obligors shall exceed One Million Dollars ($1,000,000).


SECTION 7.9    MATERIAL ADVERSE CHANGE. There shall have occurred any 
condition or event that Agent or the Required Banks determine has or is 
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect or a material adverse 
effect on the rights and remedies of Agent or the Banks under the Loan 
Documents or the ability of Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries to perform 
their respective obligations under the Loan Documents. Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, a write down in equity of up to Twelve Million Dollars 
($12,000,000) due to Financial Accounting Standards Board changes to 
pension accounting shall not constitute a Material Adverse Effect.


SECTION 7.10    VALIDITY OF LOAN DOCUMENTS. (a) Any material provision of 
any Loan Document shall at any time for any reason cease to be valid and 
binding and enforceable against Borrower or any Guarantor of Payment; (b) 
the validity, binding effect or enforceability of any Loan Document against 
Borrower or any Guarantor of Payment shall be contested by any Company or 
any other Obligor; (c) Borrower or any Guarantor of Payment shall deny that 
it has any or further liability or obligation thereunder; or (d) any Loan

proceeding or case, or file a petition or an answer seeking reorganization 
or an arrangement with creditors or seeking to take advantage of any other 
law (whether federal or state) relating to relief of debtors, or admit (by 
answer, by default or otherwise) the material allegations of a petition

ARTICLE VIII.


REMEDIES UPON DEFAULT


Notwithstanding any contrary provision or inference herein or elsewhere,


SECTION 8.1    OPTIONAL DEFAULTS. If any Event of Default referred to in 
Section 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5, 7.6, 7.7, 7.8, 7.9 or 7.10 hereof shall 
occur, Agent may, with the consent of the Required Banks, and shall, at the 
request of the Required Banks, give written notice to Borrower, to:


      (a)    terminate the Commitment and the credits hereby established,
      if not previously terminated, and, immediately upon such election,
      the obligations of the Banks, and each thereof, to make any further
      Loan and the obligation of the Fronting Bank to issue any Letter of
      Credit hereunder immediately shall be terminated, and/or


      (b)    accelerate the maturity of all of the Debt (if the Debt is not
      already due and payable), whereupon all of the Debt shall become and
      thereafter be immediately due and payable in full without any
      presentment or demand and without any further or other notice of any
      kind, all of which are hereby waived by Borrower.


SECTION 8.2    AUTOMATIC DEFAULTS. If any Event of Default referred to in 
Section 7.11 hereof shall occur:


      (a)    all of the Commitment and the credits hereby established shall
      automatically and immediately terminate, if not previously
      terminated, and no Bank thereafter shall be under any obligation to
      grant any further Loan, nor shall the Fronting Bank be obligated to
      issue any Letter of Credit hereunder, and


      (b)    the outstanding principal, interest and any other amounts on
      all of the Notes, and all of the other Debt to the Banks, shall
      thereupon become and thereafter be immediately due and payable in
      full (if the Debt is not already due and payable), all without any
      presentment, demand or notice of any kind, which are hereby waived by
      Borrower.


SECTION 8.3    LETTERS OF CREDIT. If the maturity of the Notes is 
accelerated pursuant to Sections 8.1 or 8.2 hereof, Borrower shall 
immediately deposit with Agent, as security for Borrower’s and any 
Guarantor of Payment’s obligations to reimburse Agent and the Banks for any 
then outstanding Letters of Credit, cash equal to the sum of the aggregate 
undrawn balance of any then outstanding Letters of Credit. Agent and the 
Banks are hereby authorized, at their option,




NAI-1502980324v12

64

------------------------------------------------------------------------


to deduct any and all such amounts from any deposit balances then owing by 
any Bank to or for the credit or account of any Company, as security for 
Borrower’s and any Guarantor of Payment’s obligations to reimburse Agent 
and the Banks for any then outstanding Letters of Credit.


SECTION 8.4    OFFSETS. In addition to the rights and remedies of Agent and 
the Banks provided elsewhere in this Agreement or in any other Loan 
Document, or otherwise provided in law or equity, if there shall occur or 
exist any Event of Default referred to in Section 7.11 hereof or if the 
maturity of the Notes is accelerated pursuant to Section 8.1 or 8.2 hereof, 
Agent and each Bank (and/or such Bank’s affiliates) shall have the right at 
any time to set off against, and to appropriate and apply toward the 
payment of, any and all Debt then owing by Borrower to Agent or that Bank 
(including, without limitation, any participation purchased or to be 
purchased pursuant to Section 8.5 hereof), whether or not the same shall 
then have matured, any and all deposit balances and all other indebtedness 
then held or owing by Agent or that Bank (and such Bank’s affiliates) to or 
for the credit or account of Borrower or any Guarantor of Payment, all 
without notice to or demand upon Borrower or any other Person, all such 
notices and demands being hereby expressly waived by Borrower.


SECTION 8.5    EQUALIZATION PROVISION. Each Bank agrees with the other 
Banks that if it, at any time, shall obtain any Advantage over the other 
Banks or any thereof in respect of the Debt (except under Article III 
hereof), it shall purchase from the other Banks, for cash and at par, such 
additional participation in the Debt as shall be necessary to nullify the 
Advantage. If any such Advantage resulting in the purchase of an additional 
participation as aforesaid shall be recovered in whole or in part from the 
Bank receiving the Advantage, each such purchase shall be rescinded, and 
the purchase price restored (but without interest unless the Bank receiving 
the Advantage is required to pay interest on the Advantage to the Person 
recovering the Advantage from such Bank) ratably to the extent of the 
recovery. Each Bank further agrees with the other Banks that if it at any 
time shall receive any payment for or on behalf of Borrower on any 
indebtedness owing by Borrower to that Bank by reason of offset of any 
deposit or other indebtedness, it will apply such payment first to any and 
all Debt owing by Borrower to that Bank (including, without limitation, any 
participation purchased or to be purchased pursuant to this Section 8.5 or 
any other Section of this Agreement). Borrower agrees that any Bank so 
purchasing a participation from the other Banks or any thereof pursuant to 
this Section 8.5 may exercise all its rights of payment (including the 
right of set-off) with respect to such participation as fully as if such 
Bank was a direct creditor of Borrower in the amount of such participation.


ARTTICLE IX.


THE AGENT


The Banks authorize KeyBank and KeyBank hereby agrees to act as agent for 
the Banks in respect of this Agreement upon the terms and conditions set 
forth elsewhere in this Agreement, and upon the following terms and 
conditions:




NAI-1502980324v12

65

------------------------------------------------------------------------


SECTION 9.1    APPOINTMENT AND AUTHORIZATION. Each Bank hereby irrevocably 
appoints and authorizes Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf 
and to exercise such powers hereunder as are delegated to Agent by the 
terms hereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental 
thereto. Neither Agent nor any of its affiliates, directors, officers, 
attorneys or employees shall be liable for any action taken or omitted to 
be taken by it or them hereunder or in connection herewith, except for its 
or their own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a 
final non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction. The 
provisions of this Article are solely for the benefit of the Agent and the 
Banks, and the Borrower shall not have rights as a third-party beneficiary 
of any of such provisions. It is understood and agreed that the use of the 
term “agent” herein or in any other Loan Documents (or any other similar 
term) with reference to the Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary 
or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of 
any applicable law. Instead such term is used as a matter of market custom, 
and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship 
between contracting parties.


SECTION 9.2    NOTE HOLDERS. Agent may treat the payee of any Note as the 
holder thereof until written notice of transfer shall have been filed with 
it, signed by such payee and in form satisfactory to Agent.


SECTION 9.3    CONSULTATION WITH COUNSEL. Agent may consult with legal 
counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and 
other experts selected by it and shall not be liable for any action taken 
or suffered in good faith by it in accordance with the opinion of such 
counsel.


SECTION 9.4    DOCUMENTS. Agent shall not be responsible or have any 
liability for, or have any duty to examine into or pass upon the validity, 
effectiveness, genuineness or value of any Loan Documents or any other 
Related Writing furnished pursuant hereto or in connection herewith or the 
value of any collateral obtained hereunder, and Agent shall be entitled to 
assume that the same are valid, effective and genuine and what they purport 
to be.


SECTION 9.5    AGENT AND AFFILIATES. With respect to the Loans, Agent shall 
have the same rights and powers hereunder as any other Bank and may 
exercise the same as though it were not Agent, and Agent and its affiliates 
may accept deposits from, lend money to, own securities of, act as the 
financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for, and generally 
engage in any kind of business with any Company or any affiliate thereof.


SECTION 9.6    KNOWLEDGE OF DEFAULT. It is expressly understood and agreed 
that Agent shall be entitled to assume that no Default or Event of Default 
has occurred, unless Agent has been notified by Borrower pursuant to 
Section 5.15 hereof or by a Bank in writing that such Bank believes that a 
Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and specifying 
the nature thereof.


SECTION 9.7    ACTION BY AGENT. So long as Agent shall be entitled, 
pursuant to Section 9.6 hereof, to assume that no Default or Event of 
Default shall have occurred and be continuing, Agent shall be entitled to 
use its discretion with respect to exercising or refraining from exercising 
any rights that may be vested in it by, or with respect to taking or 
refraining from taking any action or actions that it may be able to take 
under or in respect of, this Agreement. Agent shall




NAI-1502980324v12

66

------------------------------------------------------------------------


incur no liability under or in respect of this Agreement by acting upon any 
notice, certificate, warranty or other writing (including any electronic 
message, internet, or intranet website posting or other distribution) or 
instrument believed by it to be genuine or authentic or to be signed by the 
proper party or parties, or with respect to anything that it may do or 
refrain from doing in the reasonable exercise of its judgment, or that may 
seem to it to be necessary or desirable in the premises. The Agent also may 
rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by 
it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any 
liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition 
hereunder to the making of a Loan, or the issuance, extension, renewal or 
increase of a Letter of Credit, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the 
satisfaction of a Bank, the Agent may presume that such condition is 
satisfactory to such Bank unless the Agent shall have received notice to 
the contrary from such Bank prior to the making of such Loan or the 
issuance of such Letter of Credit.


SECTION 9.8    NOTICES, DEFAULT, ETC. In the event that Agent shall have 
acquired actual knowledge of any Default or Event of Default, Agent shall 
promptly notify the Banks and shall take such action and assert such rights 
under this Agreement as the Required Banks shall direct and Agent shall 
inform the other Banks in writing of the action taken. Agent may take such 
action and assert such rights as it deems to be advisable, in its 
discretion, for the protection of the interests of the holders of the 
Notes.


SECTION 9.9    INDEMNIFICATION OF AGENT. The Banks agree to indemnify Agent 
(to the extent not reimbursed by Borrower) ratably, according to their 
respective Commitment Percentages, from and against any and all 
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, 
suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever 
that may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against Agent in its 
capacity as agent in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement 
or any Loan Document or any action taken or omitted by Agent with respect 
to this Agreement or any Loan Document, provided that no Bank shall be 
liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, 
penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses (including attorneys’ 
fees) or disbursements resulting from Agent’s gross negligence, willful 
misconduct or from any action taken or omitted by Agent in any capacity 
other than as agent under this Agreement in each case, as determined by a 
final non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction.


SECTION 9.10    RESIGNATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT.


      (a)    The Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to
      the Banks and the Borrower. Upon receipt of any such notice of
      resignation, the Required Banks shall have the right, with the
      consent of the Borrower (so long as no Default or Event of Default
      then exists), to appoint a successor. If no such successor shall have
      been so appointed by the Required Banks and shall have accepted such
      appointment within 30 days after the retiring Agent gives notice of
      its resignation (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the
      Required Banks) (the “Resignation Effective Date”), then the retiring
      Agent may (but shall not be obligated to), on behalf of the Banks,
      appoint a successor Agent; provided that in no event shall any such
      successor Agent be a Defaulting Bank. Whether or not a successor has
      been appointed, such resignation shall become effective in accordance
      with such notice on the Resignation Effective Date.




NAI-1502980324v12

67

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      (b)    If the Person serving as Agent is a Defaulting Bank pursuant
      to clause (d) of the definition thereof, the Required Banks may, to
      the extent permitted by applicable Law, by notice in writing to the
      Borrower and such Person remove such Person as Agent and, with the
      consent of the Borrower (so long as no Default or Event of Default
      then exists), appoint a successor. If no such successor shall have
      been so appointed by the Required Banks and shall have accepted such
      appointment within 30 days (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by
      the Required Banks) (the “Removal Effective Date”), then such removal
      shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice on
      the Removal Effective Date.

      (c)    With effect from the Resignation Effective Date or the Removal
      Effective Date (as applicable) (i) the retiring or removed Agent
      shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and
      under the other Loan Documents and (ii) except for any indemnity
      payments owed to the retiring or removed Agent, all payments,
      communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or
      through the Agent shall instead be made by or to each Bank directly,
      until such time, if any, as the Required Banks appoint a successor
      Agent as provided for above. Upon the acceptance of a successor’s
      appointment as Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and
      become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties
      of the retiring or removed Agent (other than any rights to indemnity
      payments owed to the retiring or removed Agent), and the retiring or
      removed Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and
      obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents. The fees
      payable by the Borrower to a successor Agent shall be the same as
      those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the
      Borrower and such successor. After the retiring or removed Agent’s
      resignation or removal hereunder and under the other Loan Documents,
      the provisions of this Article IX and Section 9.9 shall continue in
      effect for the benefit of such retiring or removed Agent and its
      sub-agents and their respective affiliates, officers, directors,
      attorneys, agents and employees in respect of any actions taken or
      omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring or removed
      Agent was acting as Agent.

SECTION 9.11    EXCULPATORY PROVISIONS.

A.    The Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those 
expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, and its duties 
hereunder shall be administrative in nature. Without limiting the 
generality of the foregoing, the Agent:

1.    shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, 
regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing;

2.    shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise 
any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly 
contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Agent is 
required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Banks (or such 
other number or percentage of the Banks as shall be expressly provided for 
herein or in the other Loan Documents); provided that the Agent shall not 
be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its 
counsel, may expose the Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan 
Document or applicable Law, including for the avoidance of doubt any action 
that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any Debtor Relief Law 
or that may affect a forfeiture,



NAI-1502980324v12

68

------------------------------------------------------------------------


modification or termination of property of a Defaulting Bank in violation 
of any Debtor Relief Law; and

3.    shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan 
Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the 
failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of its 
Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as the 
Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.

B.    The Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it 
(i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Banks (or such other 
number or percentage of the Banks as shall be necessary, or as the Agent 
shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as 
provided in Section 10.3 and Article VIII), or (ii) in the absence of its 
own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of 
competent jurisdiction by final and non-appealable judgment. The Agent 
shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until 
notice describing such Default is given to the Agent in writing by the 
Borrower or a Bank.

C.    The Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain 
or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in 
connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the 
contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder 
or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance 
or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or 
conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default, 
(iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this 
Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or 
document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV 
or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly 
required to be delivered to the Agent.

SECTION 9.12    DELEGATION OF DUTIES. The Agent may perform any and all of 
its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other 
Loan Document by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the 
Agent. The Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all of its 
duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective 
Affiliates, officers, directors, agents and employees. The exculpatory 
provisions of this Article IX shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the 
respective Affiliates, officers, directors, agents and employees of the 
Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective 
activities in connection with the syndication of the facilities as well as 
activities as Agent. The Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence 
or misconduct of any sub-agents except to the extent that a court of 
competent jurisdiction determines in a final and non-appealable judgment 
that the Agent acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct in the 
selection of such sub-agents.

ARTICLE X.

MISCELLANEOUS

SECTION 10.1    BANKS’ INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION. Each Bank, by its 
signature to this Agreement, acknowledges and agrees that Agent has made no 
representation or warranty, express or implied, with respect to the 
creditworthiness, financial condition, or any other condition of any 
Company or with respect to the statements contained in any information 
memorandum furnished in connection herewith or in any other oral or written 
communication between Agent and such Bank. Each Bank represents that it has 
made and shall continue to make



NAI-1502980324v12

69

------------------------------------------------------------------------


its own independent investigation of the creditworthiness, financial 
condition and affairs of the Companies in connection with the extension of 
credit hereunder, and agrees that Agent has no duty or responsibility, 
either initially or on a continuing basis, to provide any Bank with any 
credit or other information with respect thereto (other than such notices 
as may be expressly required to be given by Agent to the Banks hereunder), 
whether coming into its possession before the granting of the first Loans 
hereunder or at any time or times thereafter.

SECTION 10.2    NO WAIVER; CUMULATIVE REMEDIES. No omission or course of 
dealing on the part of Agent, any Bank or the holder of any Note in 
exercising any right, power or remedy hereunder or under any of the Loan 
Documents shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or 
partial exercise of any such right, power or remedy preclude any other or 
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or 
remedy hereunder or under any of the Loan Documents. The remedies herein 
provided are cumulative and in addition to any other rights, powers or 
privileges held by operation of law, by contract or otherwise.

SECTION 10.3    AMENDMENTS, CONSENTS. No amendment, modification, 
termination, or waiver of any provision of any Loan Document nor consent to 
any variance therefrom, shall be effective unless the same shall be in 
writing and signed by the Required Banks and then such waiver or consent 
shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific 
purpose for which given. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, 
unanimous consent of the Banks shall be required with respect to (a) any 
increase in the Commitment hereunder, (b) the extension of maturity of the 
Notes, the payment date of interest or principal thereunder, or the payment 
of commitment or other fees or amounts payable hereunder, (c) any reduction 
in the rate of interest on the Notes, or in any amount of principal or 
interest due on any Note, or the payment of commitment or other fees 
hereunder or any change in the manner of pro rata application of any 
payments made by Borrower to the Banks hereunder (provided that this clause 
(c) shall not apply to any waiver of the application of the Default Rate), 
(d) any change in any percentage voting requirement, voting rights, or the 
Required Banks definition in this Agreement, (e) the release of any 
Guarantor of Payment except for the release of a Guarantor of Payment in 
connection with a transaction expressly permitted pursuant to this 
Agreement, or (f) any amendment to this Section 10.3 or Section 8.5 hereof. 
Notice of amendments or consents ratified by the Banks hereunder shall 
immediately be forwarded by Borrower to all Banks. Each Bank or other 
holder of a Note shall be bound by any amendment, waiver or consent 
obtained as authorized by this Section 10.3, regardless of its failure to 
agree thereto.

SECTION 10.4    NOTICES.

      (a)    All notices, requests, demands and other communications
      provided for hereunder shall be in writing (including prepaid
      overnight courier, facsimile, electronic mail or similar writing)
      addressed to each party at the address specified on the signature
      pages of this Agreement, or, as to each party, at such other address
      as shall be designated by such party in a written notice to each of

      other communications provided for hereunder shall be deemed delivered

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      mail, or certified mail. Notices delivered through electronic
      communications, to the extent provided in paragraph (b) below, shall
      be effective as provided in said paragraph (b).

      (b)    Electronic Communications. Notices and other communications to
      the Banks hereunder may be delivered or furnished by electronic
      communication (including electronic mail and internet or intranet
      websites) pursuant to procedures approved by the Agent, provided that
      the foregoing shall not apply to notices to any Bank pursuant to 
      Article II if such Bank has notified the Agent that it is incapable
      of receiving notices under such Article by electronic communication.
      The Agent or the Borrower may, in its discretion, agree to accept
      notices and other communications to it hereunder by electronic
      communications pursuant to procedures approved by it; provided that
      approval of such procedures may be limited to particular notices or
      communications.

Unless the Agent otherwise prescribes, (i) notices and other communications 
sent to an electronic mail address shall be deemed received upon the 
sender’s receipt of an acknowledgement from the intended recipient (such as 
by the “return receipt requested” function, as available, return electronic 
mail or other written acknowledgement), and (ii) notices or communications 
posted to an internet or intranet website shall be deemed received upon the 
deemed receipt by the intended recipient, at its electronic mail address as 
described in the foregoing clause (i), of notification that such notice or 
communication is available and identifying the website address therefor; 
provided that, for both clauses (i) and (ii) above, if such notice, 
electronic mail or other communication is not sent during the normal 
business hours of the recipient, such notice or communication shall be 
deemed to have been sent at the opening of business on the next business 
day for the recipient.

SECTION 10.5    COSTS, EXPENSES AND TAXES. Borrower agrees to pay on demand 
all costs and expenses of Agent, including, but not limited to, (a) 
syndication, administration, travel and out-of-pocket expenses, including 
but not limited to consultants’ and attorneys’ fees and expenses, of Agent 
in connection with the preparation, negotiation and closing of the Loan 
Documents and the administration of the Loan Documents, the collection and 
disbursement of all funds hereunder and the other instruments and documents 
to be delivered hereunder, (b) extraordinary expenses of Agent in 
connection with the administration of the Loan Documents and the other 
instruments and documents to be delivered hereunder, and (c) the reasonable 
fees and out-of-pocket expenses of special counsel for the Banks, with 
respect to the foregoing, and of local counsel, if any, who may be retained 
by said special counsel with respect thereto. Borrower also agrees to pay 
on demand all costs and expenses of Agent and the Banks, including 
reasonable attorneys’ fees, in connection with the restructuring or 
enforcement of the Debt, this Agreement or any Related Writing. In 
addition, Borrower shall pay any and all stamp and other Taxes and fees 
payable or determined to be payable in connection with the execution and 
delivery of the Loan Documents, and the other instruments and documents to 
be delivered hereunder, and agrees to hold Agent and each Bank harmless 
from and against any and all liabilities with respect to or resulting from 
any delay in paying or omission to pay such Taxes or fees.

SECTION 10.6    INDEMNIFICATION.

      (a)Borrower agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Agent and
      the Banks (and their respective affiliates, officers, directors,
      attorneys, agents and employees) (each such Person being called an “
      Indemnitee”) from and against any and all liabilities,



NAI-1502980324v12

71

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
      costs, expenses (including attorneys’ fees) or disbursements of any
      kind or nature whatsoever that may be imposed on, incurred by or
      asserted against Agent or any Bank in connection with any
      investigative, administrative or judicial proceeding (whether or not
      such Bank or Agent shall be designated a party thereto) or any other
      claim by any Person (other than any claim arising out of transactions
      solely between any of the Indemnitees (other than disputes involving
      claims against Agent in its capacity as such)) relating to or arising
      out of any Loan Document or any actual or proposed use of proceeds of
      the Loans or any of the Debt, or any activities of any Company or any
      Obligor or any of their respective Affiliates; provided that no
      Indemnitee shall have the right to be indemnified under this Section
      10.6 for its own bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct as
      determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and
      non-appealable decision. All obligations provided for in this 
      Section 10.6 shall survive any termination of this Agreement. This 
      Section 10.6(a) shall not apply with respect to Taxes other than any
      Taxes that represent losses, claims, damages, penalties or expenses
      arising from any non-Tax claim.

      (b)To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, the Borrower
      shall not assert, and hereby waives, any claim against any
      Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect,
      consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual
      damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this
      Agreement, any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument
      contemplated hereby, the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby,
      any Loan or Letter of Credit, or the use of the proceeds thereof. No
      Indemnitee referred to in clause (a) above shall be liable for any
      damages arising from the use by unintended recipients of any
      information or other materials distributed by it through
      telecommunications, electronic or other information transmission
      systems in connection with this Agreement or the other Loan Documents
      or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

SECTION 10.7    OBLIGATIONS SEVERAL; NO FIDUCIARY OBLIGATIONS. The 
obligations of the Banks hereunder are several and not joint. Nothing 
contained in this Agreement and no action taken by Agent or the Banks 
pursuant hereto shall be deemed to constitute the Banks a partnership, 
association, joint venture or other entity. No default by any Bank 
hereunder shall excuse the other Banks from any obligation under this 
Agreement; but no Bank shall have or acquire any additional obligation of 
any kind by reason of such default. The relationship among Borrower and the 
Banks with respect to the Loan Documents and the Related Writings is and 
shall be solely that of debtor and creditors, respectively, and neither 
Agent nor any Bank has any fiduciary obligation toward Borrower with 
respect to any such documents or the transactions contemplated thereby.

SECTION 10.8    EXECUTION IN COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed 
in any number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate 
counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be deemed 
to be an original and all of which taken together shall constitute but one 
and the same agreement.

SECTION 10.9    BINDING EFFECT; BORROWER’S ASSIGNMENT. This Agreement shall 
become effective when it shall have been executed by Borrower, Agent and by 
each Bank and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of 
Borrower, Agent and each of the Banks and their respective successors and 
assigns, except that Borrower shall not have the right to assign



NAI-1502980324v12

72

------------------------------------------------------------------------


its rights hereunder or any interest herein without the prior written 
consent of Agent and all of the Banks. This Agreement is an amendment and 
restatement of the A&R Credit Agreement. On the Effective Date all Letters 
of Credit issued under the A&R Credit Agreement shall be deemed to be 
Letters of Credit hereunder and all Loans outstanding under the A&R Credit 
Agreement shall be deemed to be Loans hereunder and all Loans shall be 
deemed repaid and readvanced on the Effective Date in accordance with the 
Commitment Percentages.

SECTION 10.10    ASSIGNMENTS.

      (a)    Each Bank shall have the right, in accordance with the terms
      and conditions of this Section 10.10, at any time or times to assign
      to one or more commercial banks, finance companies, insurance
      companies or other financial institution or fund which, in each case,
      in the ordinary course of business extends credit of the type
      contemplated herein, without recourse, all or a percentage of all of
      such Bank’s Commitment, all Loans made by such Bank, such Bank’s
      Notes, and such Bank’s interest in any participation purchased
      pursuant to Section 2.1C or 8.5 hereof.

      (b)    No assignment may be consummated pursuant to this Section
      10.10 without the prior written consent of Borrower and Agent (other
      than an assignment by any Bank to any Affiliate of such Bank), which
      consent of Borrower and Agent shall not be unreasonably withheld; 
      provided, however, that, Borrower’s consent shall not be required if,
      (i) such assignment is to another Bank or an Approved Fund, or (ii)
      at the time of the proposed assignment, any Default or Event of
      Default shall then exist; provided, further, the Borrower shall be
      deemed to have consented to any such assignment unless it shall
      object thereto by written notice to the Agent within (7) Business
      Days after having received notice thereof. Anything herein to the
      contrary notwithstanding, any Bank may at any time make a collateral
      assignment of all or any portion of its rights under the Loan
      Documents to a Federal Reserve Bank, and no such assignment shall
      release such assigning Bank from its obligations hereunder.

      (c)    Each assignment made pursuant to this Section 10.10 shall be
      in a minimum amount of the lesser of Ten Million Dollars
      ($10,000,000) of the assignor’s Commitment and interest herein or the
      entire amount of the assignor’s Commitment and interest herein.

      (d)    Unless waived by Agent, either the assignor or the assignee
      shall remit to Agent, for its own account, an administrative fee of
      Three Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($3,500).

      (e)    The parties to each assignment shall (i) execute and deliver
      to Borrower and Agent an Assignment Agreement and (ii) execute and
      deliver, or cause the assignee to execute and deliver, as the case
      may be, to Agent such additional amendments, assurances and other
      writings as Agent may reasonably require.

      (f)    [Reserved.]



NAI-1502980324v12

73

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      (g)    Upon satisfaction of all applicable requirements specified in
      subparts (a) though (f) above, Borrower shall execute and deliver (i)
      to Agent, the assignor and the assignee, any consent or release (of
      all or a portion of the obligations of the assignor) required to be
      delivered by Borrower in connection with the Assignment Agreement,
      and (ii) to the assignee or the assignor (if applicable), an
      appropriate Note or Notes. After delivery of the new Note or Notes,
      the assignor’s Note or Notes being replaced shall be returned to
      Borrower marked “replaced”.

      (h)    Upon satisfaction of all applicable requirements specified in
      subparts (a) though (f) above and any other condition contained in
      this Section 10.10, and subject to the acceptance and recording
      thereof by Agent pursuant to Section 10.10(i), (i) the assignee shall
      become and thereafter be deemed to be a “Bank” for the purposes of
      this Agreement, (ii) the Assignor shall be released from its
      obligations hereunder to the extent its interest has been assigned,
      (iii) in the event that the assignor’s entire interest has been
      assigned, the assignor shall cease to be and thereafter shall no
      longer be deemed to be a “Bank” but shall continue to be entitled to
      the benefits of Sections 3.1, 3.7 and 10.6 hereof with respect to
      facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such
      assignment and (iv) the signature pages hereto and Schedule 1 hereto
      shall be automatically amended, without further action, to reflect
      the result of any such assignment.

      (i)    Agent, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent
      of Borrower, shall maintain at the address for notices referred to in 
      Section 10.4 hereof a copy of each Assignment Agreement delivered to
      it and a register (the “Register”) for the recordation of the names
      and addresses of the Bank and the Commitment of, and principal amount
      of (and stated interest on) the Loans owing to, each Bank from time
      to time. The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, in the
      absence of manifest error, and Borrower, Agent and the Bank may treat
      each financial institution whose name is recorded in the Register as
      the owner of the Loan recorded therein for all purposes of this
      Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by Borrower
      or any Bank at any reasonable time and from time to time upon
      reasonable prior notice.

SECTION 10.11    PARTICIPATIONS.

      (a)    Each Bank shall have the right at any time or times, without
      the consent of Agent or Borrower, to sell one or more participations
      or sub-participations to a financial institution or other “accredited
      investor” (as defined in SEC Regulation D) (each a “Participant”), as
      the case may be, in all or any part of such Bank’s Commitment, such
      Bank’s Commitment Percentage, any Loan made by such Bank, any Note
      delivered to such Bank pursuant to this Agreement, and such Bank’s
      interest in any participation, if any, purchased pursuant to Section
      2.1C or 8.5 or this Section 10.11.

      (b)    The provisions of Article III and Section 10.6 shall inure to
      the benefit of each purchaser of a participation or sub-participation
      and Agent shall continue to distribute payments pursuant to this
      Agreement as if no participation has been sold.

      (c)    If any Bank shall sell any participation or sub-participation
      pursuant to this Section 10.11, such Bank shall, as between itself
      and the purchaser, retain all of its rights



NAI-1502980324v12

74

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      (including, without limitation, rights to enforce against Borrower
      the Loan Documents and the Related Writings) and duties pursuant to
      the Loan Documents and the Related Writings, including, without
      limitation, such Bank’s right to approve any waiver, consent or
      amendment pursuant to Section 10.3, except if and to the extent that
      (i) such participant is an Affiliate or an Approved Fund of the Bank
      granting the participations or (ii) any such waiver, consent or
      amendment affects such Participant and would (A) reduce any fee or
      commission allocated to the participation or sub-participation, as
      the case may be; (B) reduce the amount of any principal payment on
      any Loan allocated to the participation or sub-participation, as the
      case may be, or reduce the principal amount of any Loan so allocated
      or the rate of interest payable thereon, (C) extend the time for
      payment of any amount allocated to the participation or
      sub-participation, as the case may be, (D) release any guarantor from
      its guaranty of any of the Obligations, except in accordance with the
      terms of the Loan Documents, or (E) consent to the assignment or
      transfer by Borrower of any of its rights and obligations under this
      Agreement, provided that each participant shall be entitled to the
      benefits of ýSection 3.2 with respect to its participation as if it
      was a Bank, except that a participant shall (1) only deliver the
      forms described in ýSection 3.2G to the Bank granting it such
      participation and (2) not be entitled to receive any greater payment
      under ýSection 3.2 than the applicable Bank would have been entitled
      to receive absent the participation, except to the extent such
      entitlement to a greater payment arose from a Change in Law occurring
      after the participant became a participant hereunder.

      (d)    No participation or sub-participation shall operate as a
      delegation of any duty of the seller thereof.

      (e)    Under no circumstance shall any participation or
      sub-participation be deemed a novation in respect of all or any part
      of the seller’s obligations pursuant to this Agreement.

In the event that any Bank sells participations in a Loan, such Bank shall, 
acting for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of Borrower, maintain a 
register on which it enters the name of all participants in such Loan and 
the principal amount of (and stated interest on) the portion of such Loan 
that is the subject of the participation (the “Participant Register”). The 
entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest 
error, and each Borrower, Agent and each Bank shall treat each person whose 
name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of the 
participation in question for all purposes of this Agreement 
notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. A Loan (and the registered 
note, if any, evidencing the same) may be participated in whole or in part 
only by registration of such participation on the Participant Register (and 
each registered note shall expressly so provide). Any participation of a 
Loan (and the registered note, if any, evidencing the same) may be effected 
only by the registration of such participation on the Participant Register. 
The Participant Register shall be available for inspection by Borrower and 
any Bank at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior 
notice; provided, however, that no Bank shall have any obligation to 
disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the 
identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant’s 
interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other 
obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent 
that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, 
letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 
5f.103-1(c) of the United




NAI-1502980324v12

------------------------------------------------------------------------


States Treasury Regulations. For the avoidance of doubt, Agent (in its 
capacity as Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a 
Participant Register.


SECTION 10.12    [RESERVED.]


SECTION 10.13    SEVERABILITY OF PROVISIONS; CAPTIONS; ATTACHMENTS. Any 
provision of this Agreement that is prohibited or unenforceable in any 
jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent 
of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining 
provisions hereof or affecting the validity or enforceability of such 
provision in any other jurisdiction. The several captions to Sections and 
subsections herein are inserted for convenience only and shall be ignored 
in interpreting the provisions of this Agreement. Each schedule or exhibit 
attached to this Agreement shall be incorporated herein and shall be deemed 
to be a part hereof.


SECTION 10.14    [RESERVED.]


SECTION 10.15    ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement, any Note and any other 
Loan Document or other agreement, document or instrument attached hereto or 
executed on or as of the Effective Date integrate all the terms and 
conditions mentioned herein or incidental hereto and supersede all oral 
representations and negotiations and prior writings with respect to the 
subject matter hereof.


SECTION 10.16    GOVERNING LAW; SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION. This Agreement, 
each of the Notes and any Related Writing shall be governed by and 
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Ohio and the 
respective rights and obligations of Borrower and the Banks shall be 
governed by Ohio law, without regard to principles of conflict of laws. 
Borrower hereby irrevocably submits to the non‑exclusive jurisdiction of 
any Ohio state or federal court sitting in Cleveland, Ohio, over any action 
or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Debt or any 
Related Writing, and Borrower hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in 
respect of such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such 
Ohio state or federal court. Borrower, on behalf of itself and its 
Subsidiaries, hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by 
law, any objection it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue in 
any action or proceeding in any such court as well as any right it may now 
or hereafter have to remove such action or proceeding, once commenced, to 
another court on the grounds of FORUM NON CONVENIENS or otherwise. Borrower 
agrees that a final, non-appealable judgment in any such action or 
proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions 
by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.


SECTION 10.17    LEGAL REPRESENTATION OF PARTIES. The Loan Documents were 
negotiated by the parties with the benefit of legal representation and any 
rule of construction or interpretation otherwise requiring this Agreement 
or any other Loan Document to be construed or interpreted against any party 
shall not apply to any construction or interpretation hereof or thereof.


SECTION 10.18    USA PATRIOT ACT. Each Bank and the Agent to the extent 
subject to the USA Patriot Act hereby notifies Borrower that pursuant to 
the requirements of the USA Patriot Act, it is required to obtain, verify 
and record information that identifies each Credit Party, which

------------------------------------------------------------------------


information includes the name and address of each Credit Party and other 
information that will allow such Bank or the Agent to identify each Credit 
Party in accordance with the USA Patriot Act.


SECTION 10.19    HEDGING LIABILITY. Notwithstanding any provision hereof or 
in any other Loan Document to the contrary, in the event that any Credit 
Party is not an “eligible contract participant” as such term is defined in 
Section 1(a)(18) of the Commodity Exchange Act, as amended, at the time (i) 
any transaction is entered into under any Hedging Obligation or (ii) such 
Person becomes a Borrower or Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder, and the effect 
of the foregoing would be to render any Guaranty Obligations of such Person 
violative of the Commodity Exchange Act, the Obligations of such Person 
shall not include (x) in the case of clause (i) above, such transaction and 
(y) in the case of clause (ii) above, any transactions outstanding under 
any Hedging Obligations as of the date such Person becomes a Borrower or 
Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder.


SECTION 10.20    JURY TRIAL WAIVER. Borrower, Agent and each of the Banks 
waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any right to have 
a jury participate in resolving any dispute, whether sounding in contract,

arising out of, in connection with, related to, or incidental to the 
relationship established among them in connection with this Agreement or 
any Note or other instrument, document or agreement executed or delivered 
in connection herewith or the transactions related thereto.


SECTION 10.21    SERVICE OF PROCESS. Each party hereto irrevocably consents 
to service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 10.4. 
Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party hereto to

SECTION 10.22    ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND CONSENT TO BAIL-IN OF EEA FINANCIAL 
INSTITUTIONS. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Loan Document 
or in any other agreement, arrangement or understanding among any such 
parties, each party hereto acknowledges that any liability of any EEA 
Financial Institution arising under any Loan Document, to the extent such 
liability is unsecured, may be subject to the Write-Down and Conversion 
Powers of an EEA Resolution Authority and agrees and consents to, and 
acknowledges and agrees to be bound by:


      (a)    the application of any Write-Down and Conversion Powers by an
      EEA Resolution Authority to any such liabilities arising hereunder
      which may be payable to it by any party hereto that is an EEA
      Financial Institution; and


      (b)    the effects of any Bail-in Action on any such liability,
      including, if applicable (i) a reduction in full or in part or
      cancellation of any such liability, (ii) a conversion of all, or a
      portion of, such liability into shares or other instruments of
      ownership in such EEA Financial Institution, its parent undertaking,
      or a bridge institution that may be issued to it or otherwise
      conferred on it, and that such shares or other instruments of
      ownership will be accepted by it in lieu of any rights with respect
