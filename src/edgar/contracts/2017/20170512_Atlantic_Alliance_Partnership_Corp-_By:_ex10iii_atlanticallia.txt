LOCK-UP AGREEMENT
 
THIS LOCK-UP AGREEMENT (this “Agreement”) is made as of [●], 2017 by and 
between (i) Atlantic Alliance Partnership Corp., a British Virgin Islands 
business company with limited liability, (including any successor entity 
thereto, the “Company”) and (ii) the undersigned (“Holder”). Any 
capitalized term used but not defined in this Agreement will have the 
meaning ascribed to such term in the Merger Agreement (as defined below).
 
WHEREAS, the Company and Kalyx Development Inc., a Maryland corporation (“
Kalyx”), are parties to that certain Merger Agreement, dated as of May 8, 
2017 (as amended, the “Merger Agreement”), pursuant to which Kalyx will 
merge with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the 
surviving entity as a Maryland incorporated real estate investment trust 
(the “Merger”), and as a result of which, among other matters, (i) all of 
the issued and outstanding capital stock of Kalyx immediately prior to the 
effective time of the Merger will no longer be outstanding and shall 
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, in exchange for the 
right of the holder of such shares to receive a number of shares of the 
capital stock of the Company, as set forth in the Merger Agreement, and 
(ii) outstanding Kalyx Warrants will be assumed by the Company (such 
assumed warrants, the “Company Warrants”), with certain warrants being 
amended in accordance with the terms set out in the Merger Agreement, all 
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger 
Agreement and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Maryland 
General Corporation Law, as amended.
 
WHEREAS, holders of Class A Units and LTIP profits interests of the 
Operating Partnership (the “OP Units”) have the right to convert those OP 
Units for shares of Kalyx Common Stock under certain circumstances, as set 
forth in the Operating Partnership Agreement, and after the consummation of 
the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the “Closing”), the 
OP Units will instead have the right to convert into shares of Company 
common stock;
 
WHEREAS, Holder is a holder of shares of Kalyx stock, Kalyx Warrants and/or 
OP Units in such amounts as set forth underneath Holder’s name on the 
signature page hereto; and
 
WHEREAS, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and in view of the valuable 
consideration to be received by Holder thereunder, the Company and Holder 
desire to enter into this Agreement, pursuant to which the shares of 
Company common stock issued to Holder as Merger Consideration, the Company 
Warrants issued to Holder, all shares of Company common stock underlying 
the Company Warrants received by Holder in the Merger and all OP Units held 
by Holder and shares of Company common stock received by Holder in 
conversion of Holder’s OP Units (all such securities, together with any 
securities paid as dividends or distributions with respect to such 
securities or into which such securities are exchanged or converted, the “
Restricted Securities”) shall become subject to limitations on disposition 
as set forth herein.
 

1

 

 
 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises set forth above, which 
are incorporated in this Agreement as if fully set forth below, and 
intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereby agree as follows:
 
  	1. 	Lock-Up Provisions.
 
(a)  Holder hereby agrees not to, during the period commencing from the 
Closing and continuing for the earliest of: (x) the one (1) year 
anniversary date of the Closing, (y) the date on which the closing sale 
price of the Company’s common stock equals or exceeds Twelve U.S. Dollars 
(US$12.00) per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, 
reorganizations and recapitalizations) for any twenty (20) trading days 
within any thirty (30) trading day period commencing at least one-hundred 
and fifty (150) days after the Closing, and (z) the date after the Closing 
on which the Company consummates a transaction, including a liquidation, 
merger, stock exchange or other similar transaction (a “Subsequent 
Transaction”), which results in all of the Company’s stockholders having 
the right to exchange their shares of Company common stock for cash, 
securities or other property (such period, the “Lock-Up Period”): (i) lend, 
offer, pledge, hypothecate, encumber, donate, assign, sell, contract to 
sell, sell any option or contract to purchase, purchase any option or 
contract to sell, grant any option, right or warrant to purchase, or 
otherwise transfer or dispose of, directly or indirectly, any Restricted 
Securities, (ii) enter into any swap or other arrangement that transfers to 
another, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership 
of the Restricted Securities, or (iii) publicly disclose the intention to 
do any of the foregoing, whether any such transaction described in clauses 
(i), (ii), or (iii) above is to be settled by delivery of Restricted 
Securities or other securities, in cash or otherwise (any of the foregoing 
described in clauses (i), (ii), or (iii), a “Prohibited Transfer”). The 
foregoing sentence shall not apply to the transfer of any or all of the 
Restricted Securities owned by Holder, (A) by gift, will or intestate 
succession upon the death of Holder, (B) to any Permitted Transferee or (C) 
pursuant to a court order or settlement agreement related to the 
distribution of assets in connection with the dissolution of marriage or 
civil union; provided, however, that in any of cases (A), (B) or (C) it 
shall be a condition to such transfer that the transferee executes and 
delivers to the Company an agreement stating that the transferee is 
receiving and holding the Restricted Securities subject to the provisions 
of this Agreement applicable to Holder, and there shall be no further 
transfer of such Restricted Securities except in accordance with this 
Agreement. As used in this Agreement, the term “Permitted Transferee” shall 
mean: (I) the members of Holder’s immediate family (for purposes of this 
Agreement, “immediate family” shall mean any relationship by blood, 
marriage or adoption, not more remote than first cousin), (II) any trust 
for the direct or indirect benefit of Holder or the immediate family of 
Holder, (III) if Holder is a trust, to the trustor or beneficiary of such 
trust or to the estate of a beneficiary of such trust, (IV) as a 
distribution to limited partners, shareholders, members of, or owners of 
similar equity interests in Holder upon the liquidation and dissolution of 
Holder or (V) to any affiliate of Holder or to any investment fund or other 
entity controlled by Holder.
 
(b)  If any Prohibited Transfer is made or attempted contrary to the 
provisions of this Agreement, such purported Prohibited Transfer shall be 
null and void ab initio, and the Company shall refuse to recognize any such 
purported transferee of the Restricted Securities as one of its equity 
holders for any purpose. In order to enforce this Section 1, the Company 
may impose stop-transfer instructions with respect to the Restricted 
Securities of Holder (and permitted transferees and assigns thereof) until 
the end of the Lock-Up Period.
 
(c)  During the Lock-Up Period, each certificate evidencing any Restricted 
Securities shall be stamped or otherwise imprinted with a legend in 
substantially the following form, in addition to any other applicable 
legends:
 
    “THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE ARE SUBJECT TO
    RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER SET FORTH IN A LOCK-UP AGREEMENT, DATED AS OF
    [●], 2017, BY AND AMONG THE ISSUER OF SUCH SECURITIES (THE “COMPANY”)
    AND THE COMPANY’S SHAREHOLDER NAMED THEREIN, AS AMENDED. A COPY OF SUCH
    LOCK-UP AGREEMENT WILL BE FURNISHED WITHOUT CHARGE BY THE COMPANY TO
    THE HOLDER HEREOF UPON WRITTEN REQUEST.”
         
(d)  For the avoidance of any doubt, Holder shall retain all of its rights 
as a shareholder of the Company during the Lock-Up Period, including the 
right to vote any Restricted Securities.

  	2. 	Miscellaneous.
 
(a)  Termination of Merger Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the 
contrary contained herein, in the event that the Merger Agreement is 
terminated in accordance with its terms prior to the Closing, this 
Agreement and all rights and obligations of the parties hereunder shall 
automatically terminate and be of no further force or effect.
 
(b)  Binding Effect; Assignment. This Agreement and all of the provisions 
hereof shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto 
and their respective permitted successors and assigns. This Agreement and 
all obligations of Holder are personal to Holder and may not be transferred 
or delegated by Holder at any time. The Company may freely assign any or 
all of its rights under this Agreement, in whole or in part, to any 
successor entity (whether by merger, consolidation, equity sale, asset sale 
or otherwise) without obtaining the consent or approval of Holder.
 
(c)  Authorization on Behalf of the Company. The parties acknowledge and 
agree that notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this 
Agreement, any determinations, actions or other authorizations under this 
Agreement on behalf of the Company, including enforcing the Company’s 
rights and remedies under this Agreement, or providing any waivers with 
respect to the provisions hereof, shall solely be made by the Company’s 
directors who qualify as independent directors under the applicable U.S. 
national stock exchange on which shares of the Company’s common stock are 
then listed (or if the Company’s common stock no longer listed on an U.S. 
national stock exchange, the last national stock exchange on which the 
Company’s common stock was listed) and are otherwise not the Holder or an 
Affiliate of the Holder (the “Independent Directors”), with the Independent 
Directors acting by majority vote, consent or approval thereof. In the 
event that the Company at any time does not have any Independent Directors, 
so long as Holder has any remaining obligations under this Agreement, the 
Company will promptly appoint one in connection with this Agreement. 
Without limiting the foregoing, in the event that Holder or Holder’s 
Affiliate serves as a director, officer, employee or other authorized agent 
of the Company or any of its current or future Affiliates, Holder and/or 
Holder’s Affiliate shall have no authority, express or implied, to act or 
make any determination on behalf of the Company or any of its current or 
future Affiliates in connection with this Agreement or any dispute or 
Action with respect hereto.
 
(d)  Third Parties. Nothing contained in this Agreement or in any 
instrument or document executed by any party in connection with the 
transactions contemplated hereby shall create any rights in, or be deemed 
to have been executed for the benefit of, any person or entity that is not 
a party hereto or thereto or a successor or permitted assign of such a 
party.
 
(e)  Governing Law; Jurisdiction. This Agreement and any dispute or 
controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be governed 
by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, 
without regard to the conflict of law principles thereof. All Actions 
arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be heard and determined 
exclusively in any state or federal court located in New York, New York (or 
in any appellate courts thereof) (the “Specified Courts”). Each party 
hereto hereby (i) submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of any Specified 
Court for the purpose of any Action arising out of or relating to this 
Agreement brought by any party hereto and (ii) irrevocably waives, and 
agrees not to assert by way of motion, defense or otherwise, in any such 
Action, any claim that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of 
the above-named courts, that its property is exempt or immune from 
attachment or execution, that the Action is brought in an inconvenient 
forum, that the venue of the Action is improper, or that this Agreement or 
the transactions contemplated hereby may not be enforced in or by any 
Specified Court. Each party agrees that a final judgment in any Action 
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on 
the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. Each party irrevocably 
consents to the service of the summons and complaint and any other process 
in any other action or proceeding relating to the transactions contemplated 
by this Agreement, on behalf of itself, or its property, by personal 
delivery of copies of such process to such party at the applicable address 
set forth in Section 2(h). Nothing in this Section 2(e) shall affect the 
right of any party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by 
applicable law.

(f)  WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY WAIVES TO THE 
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL 
BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY ACTION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, 
UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED 
HEREBY. EACH PARTY HERETO (i) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER 
PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD 
NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THAT FOREGOING WAIVER AND 
(ii) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO 
ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND 
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 2(f).
 
(g)  Interpretation. The titles and subtitles used in this Agreement are 
for convenience only and are not to be considered in construing or 
interpreting this Agreement. In this Agreement, unless the context 
otherwise requires: (i) any pronoun used in this Agreement shall include

form of nouns, pronouns and verbs shall include the plural and vice versa;

other words of similar import in this Agreement shall be deemed in each 
case to refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular

means “and/or”. The parties have participated jointly in the negotiation 
and drafting of this Agreement. Consequently, in the event an ambiguity or

If to Holder, to: the address set forth below Holder’s name on the 
signature page to this Agreement.
     
(i)  Amendments and Waivers. Any term of this Agreement may be amended and 
the observance of any term of this Agreement may be waived (either 
generally or in a particular instance, and either retroactively or 
prospectively) only with the written consent of the Company and Holder. No 
failure or delay by a party in exercising any right hereunder shall operate 
as a waiver thereof. No waivers of or exceptions to any term, condition, or 
provision of this Agreement, in any one or more instances, shall be deemed 
to be or construed as a further or continuing waiver of any such term, 
condition, or provision.
 
(j)  Severability. In case any provision in this Agreement shall be held 
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in a jurisdiction, such provision shall 
be modified or deleted, as to the jurisdiction involved, only to the extent 
necessary to render the same valid, legal and enforceable, and the 
validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof 
shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby nor shall the 
validity, legality or enforceability of such provision be affected thereby 
in any other jurisdiction. Upon such determination that any term or other 
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties 
will substitute for any invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision a 
suitable and equitable provision that carries out, so far as may be valid, 
legal and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid, illegal or 
unenforceable provision.
 
(k)  Specific Performance. Holder acknowledges that its obligations under 
this Agreement are unique, recognizes and affirms that in the event of a 
breach of this Agreement by Holder, money damages will be inadequate and 
the Company will have not adequate remedy at law, and agrees that 
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of 
this Agreement were not performed by Holder in accordance with their 
specific terms or were otherwise breached. Accordingly, the Company shall 
be entitled to an injunction or restraining order to prevent breaches of 
this Agreement by Holder and to enforce specifically the terms and 
provisions hereof, without the requirement to post any bond or other 
security or to prove that money damages would be inadequate, this being in 
addition to any other right or remedy to which the Company may be entitled 
under this Agreement, at law or in equity.
 

5

 

 
(l)   Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the full and entire 
understanding and agreement among the parties with respect to the subject 
matter hereof, and any other written or oral agreement relating to the 
subject matter hereof existing between the parties is expressly canceled; 
provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing shall not affect 
the rights and obligations of the parties under the Merger Agreement or any 
Ancillary Document. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this 
Agreement shall limit any of the rights or remedies of the Company or any 
of the obligations of Holder under any other agreement between Holder and 
the Company or any certificate or instrument executed by Holder in favor of 
the Company, and nothing in any other agreement, certificate or instrument 
shall limit any of the rights or remedies of the Company or any of the 
obligations of Holder under this Agreement.
         
(m)  Further Assurances. From time to time, at another party’s request and 
without further consideration (but at the requesting party’s reasonable 
cost and expense), each party shall execute and deliver such additional 
documents and take all such further action as may be reasonably necessary 
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
 
(n)   Counterparts; Facsimile.  This Agreement may also be executed and 
delivered by facsimile signature or by email in portable document format in 
two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but 
all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.
