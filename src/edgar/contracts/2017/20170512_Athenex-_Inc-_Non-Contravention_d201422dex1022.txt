ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT dated as of                     , 2017 (this 
Agreement), between Athenex, Inc., a Delaware corporation (Purchaser) 
and Amphastar Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Delaware corporation (Seller).

WHEREAS, pursuant to an asset purchase agreement dated as of March 4, 2016 
(the Hikma Asset Purchase Agreement), Seller purchased certain assets, 
including the Transferred Assets (as defined herein), from Hikma 
Pharmaceuticals PLC, a public limited company incorporated in England and 
Wales (Hikma) (the Hikma Acquisition);

WHEREAS, Seller owns the Transferred Assets;

WHEREAS, Seller desires to sell, transfer and deliver the Transferred 
Assets to Purchaser and Purchaser desires to acquire such Transferred 
Assets, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual agreements 
and covenants hereinafter set forth, and intending to be legally bound, the 
parties hereby agree as follows:


ARTICLE I

PURCHASE AND SALE

SECTION 1.01. Purchase and Sale.

(a) Purchase Price. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this 
Agreement, at the Closing, Seller will sell, transfer, assign, convey and 
deliver to Purchaser, and Purchaser will purchase, acquire and accept from 
Seller, all of Sellers right, title and interest in, to and under the 
Transferred Assets as of the Closing, free and clear of all Liens (other 
than Permitted Liens) for (a) an aggregate purchase price of $6.4 million 
in cash to be paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of Section 
2.02(b) (the Purchase Price); and (b) the assumption by Purchaser of the 
Assumed Liabilities. The purchase and sale of the Transferred Assets and 
the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities are collectively referred to in 
this Agreement as the Acquisition.

(b) Royalty. In addition to the Purchase Price, Purchaser agrees to pay 
Seller a royalty fee equal to 2% of Net Sales (if any) which are derived 
from Purchasers sales of the Products from the Transferred Assets (the 
Royalty Fee) for a period beginning as of the date of Closing and 
continuing until the tenth (10th) anniversary of the Closing Date (the 
Royalty Term). Such Royalty Fee shall be cumulated, will be in U.S. 
Dollars and paid to Seller within forty-five (45) days of the end of each 
calendar quarter during the Royalty Term; it being understood that the 
Royalty Fee payments shall be reconciled, to the extent necessary, in any 
subsequent quarter during the Royalty Term or at the end of the Royalty 
Term, as the case may be, based on the actual Net Sales realized by 
Purchaser. Purchaser shall provide Seller with a written statement setting 
forth the number of Product units sold and the Royalty Fee due during

------------------------------------------------------------------------
each calendar quarter during the Royalty Term within thirty (30) days of 
the end of each calendar quarter. The Purchaser shall maintain and keep for 
a period of not less than two (2) years complete and accurate records in 
sufficient detail to enable any accrued royalties to be calculated. During 
normal business hours and with reasonable advance written notice but in no 
event less than twenty (20) Business Days and not exceeding once a year 
during the Royalty Term, Purchaser shall permit a Representative of Seller 
to have access to such records of Purchaser as may be necessary to verify 
the accuracy of the records related to the Royalty Fees paid to Seller (in 
each case, a Seller Audit); provided however that any such Seller Audit 
must take place no more than one (1) year following the end of the calendar 
year during the Royalty Term at issue and will be at Sellers expense 
unless the mutually agreed upon accounting firm audit finds that the 
royalties have been under reported by more than 5%, in which case Buyer 
will pay for the audit. Promptly following Sellers completion of any such 
Seller Audit (but in no event later than thirty (30) days following such 
completion), Seller shall deliver to Purchaser written notice of the 
results of such Seller Audit, including a description in reasonable detail 
of any proposed adjustments to the Royalty Fees actually paid to Seller for 
the applicable period covered by such Seller Audit. Seller and Purchaser 
will negotiate in good faith to resolve any dispute over Sellers proposed 
adjustments to the Royalty Fees, provided that if any such dispute is not 
resolved within thirty (30) days following receipt by Purchaser of the 
proposed adjustments, either Purchaser or Seller may engage a mutually 
agreed upon accounting firm with a national presence (the Accounting Firm
) on behalf of Purchaser and Seller to resolve any remaining dispute of 
Sellers proposed adjustments, which resolution will be final. The 
Accounting Firm will be instructed to deliver its written determination 
within thirty (30) days. The Accounting Firm will address only those items 
in dispute and may not assign a value greater than the greatest value for 
such item claimed by either party or a value smaller than the smallest 
value for such item claimed by either party. The fees and expenses of the 
Accounting Firm will be shared by the parties in inverse proportion to the 
percentage of the disputed amount determined by the Accounting Firm to be 
in favor of Seller, on the hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand. The 
calculation and amount of the Royalty Fees for the period covered by any 
Seller Audit will become final and binding on all parties upon the earliest 
of (i) Sellers delivery of notice to Purchaser of the results of the 
Seller Audit whereby such results reflect Sellers agreement with the 
amount of Royalty Fees actually paid to Seller, (ii) the mutual agreement 
of Seller and Purchaser with respect to any of Sellers proposed 
adjustments to the Royalty Fees actually paid to Seller, and (iii) the 
Accounting Firms final resolution of any disputes submitted to the 
Accounting Firm. Promptly after such final determination of the amount of 
the Royalty Fees for the period covered by any Seller Audit: (x) if such 
finally determined Royalty Fee amount exceeds the amount actually paid to 
Seller, then Purchaser will pay to Seller an amount equal to such excess 
within thirty (30) days after such final determination; or (ii) if the 
amount of Royalty Fees actually paid to Seller exceed such finally 
determined Royalty Fee amount, then Seller will refund to Purchaser an 
amount equal to such excess within thirty (30) days after such final 
determination.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 1.02. Transferred Assets and Excluded Assets.

(a) The term Transferred Assets means all of Sellers right, title and 
interest in, to and under the following assets as they exist at the time of 
the Closing:

categories, to the extent applicable and obtained from Hikma, set forth in

the possession or control of a Governmental Entity or a contract 
manufacturer of the Products) and as provided in Section 5.01 
(collectively, the Transferred Books and Records);

(ii) all ANDAs listed in Section 1.02(a)(ii) of the Seller Disclosure 
Schedule (the Regulatory Approvals); and

(iii) all of the inventory for the Active Pharmaceuticals Ingredients (

Disclosure Schedule.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,

Transferred Assets and (B) Seller shall not sell, transfer, assign or 
deliver to Purchaser, and Purchaser shall not purchase, acquire or accept, 
any right, title and interest of Seller in, to or under the Commingled 
Documents or any assets of Seller or its affiliates not expressly included 
in the Transferred Assets (all such other assets, the Excluded Assets); 
provided, that Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide 
Purchaser with access to the Commingled Documents in accordance with 
Section 5.01.

(c) Subject to Section 5.02(b) and in accordance with Section 5.01, Seller 
shall have the right to retain copies of and have access to the documents, 
materials and data relating to the ownership, use, sale, license or lease 
of the Transferred Assets prior to the Closing Date.

SECTION 1.03. Assumption of Liabilities; Retained Liabilities.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement 
Purchaser shall assume, effective as of the Closing, and shall pay, perform 
and discharge when due, any and all obligations, liabilities and 
commitments of any nature, whether known or unknown, express or implied, 
primary or secondary, direct or indirect, liquidated, absolute, accrued, 
contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due (collectively, 
Liabilities):

(i) related to or arising out of the ownership, use, sale, license or lease 
of the Transferred Assets by Purchaser from and after the Closing Date, 
including all Liabilities (A) related to or arising out of products 
liability Claims with respect to the Exploitation of any Product on or 
after the Closing Date or (B) related to or arising out of government 
seizures, filed corrections, withdrawals or recalls of Product sold on or 
after the Closing Date;

Liabilities), arising out of or related to any Exploitation of Product on 
or after the Closing Date;

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(iii) for Transfer Taxes and Apportioned Obligations allocated to Purchaser 
under Section 5.07; and

(iv) related to or arising out of the matters set forth in Section 
1.03(a)(iv) of the Seller Disclosure Schedules.

The Liabilities referenced in clauses (i) through (iv) above are referred 
to, collectively, as the Assumed Liabilities.

(b) The term Retained Liabilities means all Liabilities of Seller and its 
affiliates, including without limitation to the extent related to the 
Transferred Assets, other than the Assumed Liabilities.


ARTICLE II

CLOSING

SECTION 2.01. Closing. The closing of the Acquisition (the Closing) shall 
take place by the electronic exchange of documents and signature pages on 
the date hereof (the Closing Date).

SECTION 2.02. Transactions To Be Effected at the Closing.

(a) At the Closing, Seller shall deliver or cause to be delivered to 
Purchaser duly executed binding term sheet, bills of sale, assignments, 
licenses and other instruments of transfer relating to the Transferred 
Assets, in each case in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A.

(b) At the Closing, Purchaser shall deliver or cause to be delivered to 
Seller within fifteen (15) business days of the Closing Date (i) payment, 
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to one or more accounts 
designated in writing by Seller (such designation to be made at least 
fifteen (15) days prior to the Closing Date), of $1.0 million and (ii) duly 
executed counterparts to the bills of sale, assignments, licenses and other 
instruments of transfer referred to in Section 2.02(a), and duly executed 
assumption agreements and other instruments of assumption providing for the 
assumption of the Assumed Liabilities, in each case reasonably acceptable

Purchaser. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this 
Agreement except as a result of a breach by Seller or its affiliates

------------------------------------------------------------------------
of this Agreement, and/or during the pendency of any disputes arising under 
or related hereto (whether for breach of contract, tortious conduct or 
otherwise), in the event that Purchaser fails to make any of the required 
payments set forth in this Section 2.02(b) (Payment Breach), and fails to 
cure such Payment Breach within 45 days written of notice in accordance 
with Section 8.04 thereof, Purchaser agrees to transfer the ownership of 
the Transferred Assets to Seller and Purchaser shall have no right of 
recourse to any of the previous payments.

(c)


ARTICLE III

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER

Except as set forth in the disclosure schedules of Seller (the Seller 
Disclosure Schedule), Seller hereby represents and warrants to Purchaser 
as follows:

SECTION 3.01. Organization and Standing. Seller is a legal entity duly 
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the 
jurisdiction of its organization. Seller has the requisite power and 
authority to enable it to own, lease, license or otherwise hold the 
Transferred Assets owned, leased, licensed or otherwise held by it.

SECTION 3.02. Authority; Execution and Delivery; Enforceability. Seller has 
the requisite power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and 
the other agreements and instruments to be executed and delivered by it in 
connection with this Agreement (the Ancillary Agreements) to which it 
will be a party and to consummate the Acquisition and the other 
transactions contemplated to be consummated by it by this Agreement and 
such Ancillary Agreements. Seller has taken all action required by its 
organizational documents to authorize the execution and delivery of this 
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and to authorize the consummation of 
the Acquisition and the other transactions contemplated to be consummated 
by it by this Agreement and such Ancillary Agreements. Seller has duly 
executed and delivered this Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement, and 
(assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by the other 
parties hereto) this Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement constitutes its 
legal, valid and binding obligation, enforceable against it in accordance 
with its terms subject, as to enforcement, to applicable bankruptcy, 
insolvency, moratorium, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance or similar 
Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally and to 
general equitable principles (whether considered in a Proceeding in equity 
or at law) (the Enforceability Exceptions).

SECTION 3.03. Non-Contravention and Approvals.

(a) The execution and delivery by Seller of this Agreement and each 
Ancillary Agreement does not, and the consummation by Seller of the 
Acquisition and the other transactions contemplated to be consummated by it 
by this Agreement and such Ancillary Agreements will not, (i) conflict with 
or violate the organizational documents of Seller, (ii) assuming compliance 
with Section 3.03(b), conflict with or violate any judgment, injunction,

------------------------------------------------------------------------
order or decree (Judgment) or federal, national, supranational, state, 
provincial, local, foreign or administrative statute, law, ordinance, rule, 
code or regulation (Law) to which Seller or any of the Transferred Assets 
is subject or (iii) result in the creation of any Lien (other than 
Permitted Liens or Liens arising from any act of Purchaser or its 
affiliates) upon any of the Transferred Assets, except, in the case of 
clauses (ii) and (iii), for any such items that would not, individually or 
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect 
on the Transferred Assets or materially impede or materially delay the 
consummation by Seller of the Acquisition and the other transactions 
contemplated by this Agreement (a Material Adverse Effect).

(b) Except as contemplated by this Agreement, no consent, approval, waiver, 
notice or authorization (Consent) of, or registration, declaration or 
filing with, any Governmental Entity is required to be obtained, given or 
made by Seller in connection with the execution, delivery and performance 
of this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements, or the consummation of the 
Acquisition other than (i) those that may be required solely by reason of 
Purchasers (as opposed to any other third partys) participation in the 
Acquisition and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and 
by the Ancillary Agreements and (ii) those the failure of which to obtain, 
give or make would not, individually or in the aggregate, constitute a 
Material Adverse Effect.

SECTION 3.04. Title to Assets. Seller has good and marketable title to, and 
is transferring to Purchaser all of Sellers right, title and interests in 
and to, the Transferred Assets, in each case free and clear of any 
mortgages, liens, pledges, security interests, charges or other 
encumbrances of any kind (collectively, Liens), except for Permitted 
Liens.

SECTION 3.05. Litigation. There are no Proceedings pending or, to the 
knowledge of Seller, threatened in writing against Seller or any of its 
affiliates which relate to the Transferred Assets and which, in all cases 
would, individually or in the aggregate, constitute a Material Adverse 
Effect. None of Seller or any of its affiliates is party or subject to or 
in default under any unsatisfied Judgment applicable to the Transferred 
Assets, other than such Judgments that would not, individually or in the 
aggregate, constitute a Material Adverse Effect.

SECTION 3.06. Regulatory Approvals; Compliance Arrangements. To the 
knowledge of Seller, each Regulatory Approval is valid, effective and in 
full force and effect in all material respects, and all applicable fees and 
costs that are due and payable with respect to such Regulatory Approvals 
have been paid in full.

SECTION 3.07. Hikma Asset Purchase Agreement. With respect to the 
agreements and covenants of Seller concerning the sale, transfer, 
assignment, conveyance, and delivery of, and access to, the Transferred 
Assets and the Commingled Documents (including Seller Commingled 
Information and Purchaser Commingled Information) that are set forth in 
Sections 1.01, 1.02, and 5.01(I) of this Agreement (and as such terms are 
defined in this Agreement), the Hikma Asset Purchase Agreement contains the 
same or substantially the same agreements and covenants with respect to the 
Transferred Assets and Commingled Documents (as between Hikma and Seller), 
other than with respect to (i) purchase price, (ii) efforts standards

------------------------------------------------------------------------
with respect to the delivery of and access to the Transferred Assets and 
Commingled Documents and (iii) the last sentence of Section 5.01(I) of this

validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of 
its organization or incorporation.

SECTION 4.02. Purchaser agrees to make timely payments to seller in

and the Ancillary Agreements to which it will be a party and to consummate 
the Acquisition and the other transactions contemplated to be consummated 
by it by this Agreement and such Ancillary Agreements. Purchaser has taken 
all action required by its organizational documents to authorize the 
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and 
to authorize the consummation of the Acquisition and the other transactions 
contemplated to be consummated by it by this Agreement and such Ancillary 
Agreements. Purchaser has duly executed and delivered this Agreement and 
each Ancillary Agreement, and (assuming the due

binding obligation, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms 
subject, as to enforcement, to the Enforceability Exceptions.

SECTION 4.04. Non-Contravention and Approvals.

(a) The execution and delivery by Purchaser of this Agreement and each 
Ancillary Agreement, the consummation by Purchaser of the Acquisition and 
the other transactions contemplated to be consummated by it hereunder and 
the consummation by Purchaser of the transactions contemplated to be 
consummated by them under the Ancillary Agreements will not, (i) conflict 
with or violate the organizational documents of Purchaser, (ii) result in 
any violation of, breach of or constitute a default under, or give rise to 
a right of termination, cancellation, payment or acceleration of any 
obligation or loss of a benefit under, any Contract to which Purchaser is a 
party or by which any of its properties or assets is bound, (iii) assuming 
compliance with Section 4.04(b), conflict with or violate any Judgment or 
Law to which Purchaser or its properties or assets are subject or (iv) 
result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the properties or assets of

items that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be 
expected to result in any event, change, occurrence or effect that prevents 
or materially impedes or materially delays the consummation by Purchaser of 
the Acquisition and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement 
(a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect).

(b) No Consent of, or registration, declaration or filing with, any 
Governmental Entity is required to be obtained, given or made by Purchaser 
in connection with the execution, delivery and performance of this 
Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements or the consummation of the

Sellers (as opposed to any other third partys) participation in the 
Acquisition and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and

give or make would not, individually or in the aggregate, constitute a 
Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

SECTION 4.05. Litigation. There are no Proceedings or Claims pending or, to 
the knowledge of Purchaser, threatened in writing against Purchaser or any 
of its affiliates that, in any such case, would, individually or in the 
aggregate, constitute a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect. Neither 
Purchaser nor any of its affiliates is party or subject to or in default 
under any unsatisfied Judgment, other than such Judgments that would not, 
individually or in the aggregate, constitute a Purchaser Material Adverse 
Effect.

would entitle any person to any commission or brokers fee in connection 
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 4.07. Sellers Representations; Independent Investigation.

(a) Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that, other than the representations 
and warranties of Seller specifically contained in Article III, there are 
no representations or warranties of Seller or any other person either 
expressed or implied with respect to the Transferred Assets, the Assumed 
Liabilities, or the transactions contemplated hereby, individually or 
collectively. Purchaser, together with and on behalf of its affiliates and 
Representatives, specifically disclaims that it or they are relying upon or 
have relied upon any such other representations or warranties that may have 
been made by any person, and Purchaser, together with and on behalf of its 
affiliates and Representatives, acknowledges and agrees that Seller and its 
affiliates have specifically disclaimed and do hereby specifically disclaim 
any such other representation or warranty made by any person. Without 
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Purchaser acknowledges and agrees 
that none of Seller, its affiliates or its Representatives makes any 
representations or warranties relating to (i) the maintenance, repair, 
condition, design, performance or marketability of any Transferred Asset, 
including merchantability of fitness for a particular purpose, (ii) the 
Exploitation of the Products by Seller on or prior to the Closing, (iii) 
the ownership, use, sale, license or lease of the Transferred Assets by 
Purchaser after the Closing or (iv) the Exploitation of the Transferred 
Assets by Purchaser after the Closing, including the probable success or 
profitability of the Exploitation of the Products after the Closing. Except 
as set forth in the representations and warranties in Article III, 
Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that it shall obtain rights in the 
Transferred Assets in their present condition and state of repair, as is 
and where is. Nothing in this Section 4.06 or otherwise in this Agreement 
shall limit any claim for fraud or intentional misrepresentation.

(b) Purchaser acknowledges that Purchaser, its affiliates and their 
respective Representatives have been permitted full access to the books and 
records, facilities, equipment, personnel and other properties and assets 
relating to the Transferred Assets that Purchaser, its affiliates and their 
respective Representatives have desired or requested to see and review, and 
that Purchaser, its affiliates and their respective Representatives have 
had a full opportunity to conduct and complete a due diligence 
investigation of the Transferred Assets and the Assumed Liabilities. Except 
as expressly set forth in any representation or warranty in Article III, 
Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that no person, including the Purchaser 
Indemnitees, shall have any claim (whether in warranty, contract, tort 
(including negligence or strict liability) or otherwise) or right to 
indemnification pursuant to Article VII (or otherwise) with respect to any 
information, documents or materials made available or otherwise furnished 
to or for Purchaser, its affiliates or their respective Representatives by 
Seller, Hikma, any of their respective affiliates, or any of their 
respective Representatives, including any financial projections or other 
statements regarding future performance and any other information, 
documents or material, whether oral or written, made available to 
Purchaser, its affiliates or their respective Representatives in any data 
room, management presentation, break-out discussions or meetings, 
responses to questions submitted on behalf of Purchaser, its affiliates or 
their respective Representatives or otherwise furnished to Purchaser, its 
affiliates or their respective Representatives in any form in expectation 
of the transactions contemplated hereby, except, for avoidance of doubt, 
insofar as such claim or indemnification relates to a Retained Liability or 
an Excluded Asset.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(c) Purchaser, its affiliates and their respective Representatives may have 
received and may continue to receive from Seller, Hikma, their respective 
affiliates and their respective Representatives certain estimates, 
projections and other forecasts and certain plan and budget information. 
Purchaser acknowledges that these estimates, projections, forecasts, plans 
and budgets, and the assumptions on which they are based, were prepared for 
specific purposes and may vary significantly from each other. Further, 
Purchaser acknowledges that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting 
to make such estimates, projections, forecasts, plans and budgets, that 
Purchaser is taking full responsibility for making its own evaluation of 
the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections, forecasts, plans 
and budgets so furnished to it, its affiliates or their respective 
Representatives (including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying 
such estimates, projections, forecasts, plans and budgets) and that 
Purchaser is not relying on, and Seller and its affiliates have not made 
and are not making any representations or warranties with respect to, any 
estimates, projections, forecasts, plans or budgets made available or 
otherwise furnished by Seller, Hikma, their respective affiliates or their 
respective Representatives, and Purchaser shall not, and shall cause its 
affiliates and their respective Representatives not to, hold any such 
person liable with respect thereto (whether in warranty, contract, tort 
(including negligence or strict liability) or otherwise).

(d) Purchaser, its affiliates and their respective Representatives 
acknowledge that any dispute regarding Section 3.08 (API), Seller reserves 
the right to perform its own API testing. Should there be any disputes 
regarding the API test results, both parties agree to contract with an 
independent third party laboratory to perform the API testing. Both parties 
agree to accept test result as provided by the third party laboratory.


ARTICLE V

COVENANTS

SECTION 5.01. Access to Information. (I) Notwithstanding anything herein 
(including Section 1.01 and Section 1.02(a)) to the contrary, as soon as 
practicable following the Closing Date, Seller shall use commercially 
reasonable efforts to provide to Purchaser copies of (i) the Regulatory 
Approvals, and (ii) the Commingled Documents, if any, in the categories set 
forth in Section 5.01(i) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, in the case of 
each of clauses (i) and (ii), redacted to exclude information or data 
related to products owned or licensed by third parties (including Hikma, 
Seller or their respective affiliates and excluding Purchaser or affiliates 
of Purchaser) and not included within the Transferred Assets (such 
information or data, Third Party Information). Following the Closing, 
upon the reasonable request of Purchaser therefor, Seller shall (x) use 
commercially reasonable efforts to provide to Purchaser copies of the 
Commingled Documents, if any, in the categories set forth in Section 
5.01(ii) or the categories set forth in Section 5.01(iii) of the Seller 
Disclosure Schedule, redacted with respect to all Third Party Information 
or (y) to the extent reasonably required by Purchaser in connection with 
(A) any pending Proceeding (including any Proceeding before the United 
States Patent and

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Trademark Office and any successor agency thereto, or the equivalent entity 
in other countries or regulatory jurisdictions) or (B) complying with 
requirements of any Governmental Entity, use commercially reasonable 
efforts to arrange for Hikma to grant Purchaser reasonable access to, the 
portions of the Commingled Documents, if any, in the categories set forth 
in Section 5.01(iii) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule that contain 
information regarding any Product acquired by Purchaser pursuant to this 
Agreement (such information, the Purchaser Commingled Information). Any 
such access shall be subject to confidentiality restrictions equivalent to 
those set forth in Section 5.02. In the event that Purchaser exercises its 
right to access Commingled Documents hereunder, Purchaser shall assume all 
liability for any disclosure or use of the information other than Purchaser 
Commingled Information (such other information, the Seller Commingled 
Information) contained therein and any and all loss, damage, destruction 
or alteration of such Commingled Documents arising from the use or 
possession of such Commingled Documents by Purchaser or its 
Representatives. For clarity, this Section 5.01 shall not provide either 
party hereto or any of their respective affiliates with any rights to use 
or disclose any information contained within any Commingled Documents not 
otherwise retained or obtained pursuant to this Agreement. All requests by 
Purchaser for Commingled Documents shall be directed in writing to the 
persons set forth in Section 5.01(iv) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (or 
such other persons as are designated by Seller in writing to Purchaser). 
For purposes of this Section 5.01, Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that, 
with respect to any Commingled Documents in the possession of Hikma, 
Sellers obligation to use commercially reasonable efforts to provide 
Purchaser with, or access to, such Commingled Documents shall only require 
Seller to deliver written notice to Hikma requesting access to such 
Commingled Documents. (II) Any language in this Section 5.01 to the 
contrary notwithstanding, in all events, Seller shall be obligated to 
provide to Purchaser, as soon as practicable following the Closing Date, 
copies of (i) Regulatory Approvals, and (ii) Commingled Documents 
(including Purchaser Commingled Information), that actually are in 
possession of Seller as of the Closing Date, in each case redacted to 
exclude all Third Party Information.

SECTION 5.02. Confidentiality.

(a) Purchaser acknowledges that the information provided to it in 
connection with the Acquisition and the consummation of the other 
transactions contemplated by this Agreement is subject to the terms of 
confidentiality letter agreement between Purchaser and Seller in connection 
with the Acquisition, dated September 1, 2016 (the Confidentiality 
Agreement). Effective upon, and only upon, the Closing, the 
Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate with respect to information 
relating solely to the Transferred Assets or the Assumed Liabilities; 
provided, however, that Purchaser acknowledges that any and all other 
information provided to it by any of Seller, any of its affiliates or their 
respective Representatives concerning Seller or any of its affiliates 
(other than information to the extent relating to the Transferred Assets or 
the Assumed Liabilities) shall remain subject to the terms and conditions 
of the Confidentiality Agreement after the Closing.

(b) Subject to Section 5.03, from and after the Closing until the third 
anniversary of the Closing Date, Seller shall, and shall cause its 
affiliates to, treat as confidential and shall

------------------------------------------------------------------------
safeguard any and all confidential or proprietary information, knowledge 
and data related solely to the Transferred Assets or the Assumed 
Liabilities by using the same degree of care to prevent the unauthorized 
use, dissemination or disclosure of such information, knowledge and data as 
Seller and its affiliates used with respect thereto prior to the execution 
of this Agreement; provided, however, that Seller and its affiliates shall 
be entitled to use any such information, knowledge and data only to the 
extent necessary to perform their respective obligations or exercise or 
enforce their respective rights and remedies under this Agreement, any 
Ancillary Agreement or any agreements entered into in connection with any 
of the foregoing. The obligations of Seller and its affiliates pursuant to 
this Section 5.02(b) shall not extend to any information, knowledge or data 
that is (i) required to be disclosed by applicable Law, (ii) requested by a 
government official or (iii) except as a result of a disclosure by Seller 
or its affiliates after the Closing in breach of this Agreement, generally 
available to the public or already known by a third party receiving such 
information from Seller or its affiliates.

SECTION 5.03. Publicity. Other than any press release, if any, to be agreed 
to in writing by Purchaser and Seller to be issued following the execution 
of this Agreement, neither of Purchaser, on the one hand, nor Seller, on 
the other hand, will issue or permit any of its respective affiliates to 
issue any press release, website posting or other public announcement with 
respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without 
the prior consent of the other party (which consent shall, if applicable, 
be provided as promptly as practicable), except as may be required by Law 
or stock exchange rules or regulations (in which case, whichever of 
Purchaser or its affiliates or Seller or its affiliates, as applicable, is 
required to make the release or statement shall, to the extent compliance 
with such Law, rules or regulations permits, allow the other reasonable 
time to comment on such release or statement in advance of such issuance 
and such other party shall provide any comments thereto as promptly as 
practicable); provided, however, that (a) Purchaser, on the one hand, and 
Seller, on the other hand, may, following the date hereof, make internal 
announcements to their respective employees and affiliates that are 
consistent with the parties prior permitted public disclosures regarding 
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (b) Seller and 
Purchaser may communicate with government officials, customers and 
suppliers regarding this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby 
(so long as, in the case of customers and suppliers, such communications 
are consistent with Sellers or Purchasers, as applicable, prior permitted 
public disclosures regarding the transactions contemplated by this 
Agreement, or a communications plan agreed upon by Seller and Purchaser).

SECTION 5.04. Covenant Not to Sue. Seller agrees not to object, oppose or 
otherwise challenge the use, in connection with the Exploitation of the 
Products anywhere in the world, by Purchaser and its successors, assigns, 
sublicensees, contractors, manufacturers, agents and representatives of all 
Know-How that is controlled by Seller and its affiliates as of the Closing.

SECTION 5.05. Insurance. From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall not, 
and shall cause its affiliates not to, assert any claim against any 
insurance policies or practices of Seller and its affiliates or Hikma and 
its affiliates (including any captive insurance policies,

------------------------------------------------------------------------
self-insurance, surety bonds or corporate insurance policies or practices). 
Purchaser agrees, from and after the Closing Date, to arrange for its own 
insurance policies with respect to the Transferred Assets and the Assumed 
Liabilities covering all periods and agrees not to seek, through any means, 
to benefit from any of Sellers or its affiliates insurance policies which 
may provide coverage for claims relating in any way to the Transferred 
Assets or the Assumed Liabilities.

SECTION 5.06. Change in Ownership Letters. Purchaser and Seller shall, with 
respect to each Regulatory Approval, if applicable, file each Purchaser 
Change in Ownership Letter and each Seller Change in Ownership Letter, 
respectively, with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the FDA) as 
soon as possible and in any event within 10 days after the date on which 
Seller provides to Purchaser a copy of the applicable Regulatory Approval 
underlying each such letter pursuant to and in accordance with Section 
5.01. The letters filed by Seller and Purchaser pursuant to this Section 
5.06 shall comply with all aspects of 21 C.F.R. 314.72 (Change in Ownership 
of an Application), and such letters shall provide for transfer of title to 
the Regulatory Approvals for the Products to be effective as of the 
Closing.

SECTION 5.07. Tax Covenants.

(a) As soon as practicable after the Closing, the parties shall agree upon 
an allocation of the Purchase Price (plus the Assumed Liabilities, to the 
extent properly taken into account under Section 1060 of the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended) among the Transferred Assets in 
accordance with Section 1060 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as 
amended. Seller and Purchaser shall, and shall cause their respective 
affiliates to, act in accordance with such allocation in the preparation, 
filing and audit of any Tax Return.

(b) Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate in timely making all filings, 
returns, reports and forms as may be required in connection with 
Purchasers payment of Transfer Taxes. Seller shall, or Purchaser, as 
applicable, shall execute and deliver all instruments and certificates 
necessary to enable the other to comply with any filing requirements 
relating to any such Transfer Taxes. Purchaser and Seller shall each pay 
fifty percent (50%) of all Transfer Taxes.

(c) All real property Taxes, personal property Taxes and similar ad valorem 
obligations levied with respect to the Transferred Assets for a taxable 
period which includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date (collectively, 
the Apportioned Obligations) shall be apportioned between Seller, on the 
one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, based on the number of days of 
such taxable period included in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the number 
of days included in the Post-Closing Tax Period. Seller shall be liable for 
the proportionate amount of such Taxes that is attributable to the 
Pre-Closing Tax Period and Purchaser shall be liable for the proportionate 
amount of such Taxes that is attributable to the Post-Closing Tax Period.

(d) Purchaser agrees to retain all records relating to Taxes with respect 
to the Transferred Assets for all taxable periods ending on or prior to the 
Closing Date until the expiration of the statutes of limitation (including 
any extensions thereof) for the taxable period or periods to which such 
records relate. Purchaser and Seller agree to provide each other with such 
information and assistance as is reasonably necessary, including access to 
records and personnel, for the preparation of any Tax Returns or for the 
defense of any Tax claim or assessment, whether in connection with an audit 
or otherwise.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
ARTICLE VI

counterparts of this Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement to which Seller 
is a party.

ARTICLE VII

INDEMNIFICATION; SURVIVAL

SECTION 7.01. Indemnification by Seller. Subject to this Article VII, from 
and after the Closing, Seller shall indemnify Purchaser and its affiliates 
and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, stockholders, 
agents and representatives (the Purchaser Indemnitees) from and against 
any and all losses, damages or expenses, including reasonable third-party 
legal fees and expenses in connection with any Proceeding (collectively, 
Losses), to the extent arising or resulting from any of the following:

(a) any breach of any Specified Representations and any representations and 
warranties set forth in Section 3.06 (Regulatory Approvals; Compliance 
Arrangements), Section 3.07 (Hikma Purchase Agreement) and Section 3.08 
(API);

(b) any breach of any covenant of Seller contained in this Agreement;

(c) any Excluded Asset; and

(d) any Retained Liability.

SECTION 7.02. Indemnification by Purchaser. Subject to this Article VII, 
from and after the Closing, Purchaser shall indemnify Seller and its 
affiliates and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, 
stockholders, agents and representatives (the Seller Indemnitees) from 
and against any and all Losses, to the extent arising or resulting from any 
of the following:

(a) any breach of any representation or warranty of Purchaser contained in 
this Agreement;

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(b) any breach of any covenant of Purchaser contained in this Agreement;

(c) any Assumed Liability; and

(d) the Exploitation of the Products following the Closing.

SECTION 7.03. Indemnification Procedures.

(a) Third Party Claims. If any party (the Indemnified Party) receives 
written notice of the commencement of any Proceeding or the assertion of 
any claim by a third party or the imposition of any penalty or assessment 
(in each case other than with respect to Taxes) for which indemnity may be 
sought under Section 7.01 or Section 7.02 (a Third Party Claim), and such 
Indemnified Party intends to seek indemnity pursuant to this Article VII, 
the Indemnified Party shall promptly (but no later than 30 days of 
receiving such notice) provide the other party (the Indemnifying Party) 
with written notice of such Third Party Claim, stating the nature, basis, 
the amount (to the extent known or estimated, which amount shall not be 
conclusive of the final amount of such Third Party Claim) and a reasonable 
description of any other material details thereof. Failure of the 
Indemnified Party to give such notice will not relieve the Indemnifying 
Party from its indemnification obligations hereunder, except to the extent 
that the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced thereby. The 
Indemnifying Party will have 20 days from receipt of any such notice of a 
Third Party Claim to give notice to the Indemnified Party whether it is 
assuming and controlling the defense, appeal or settlement proceedings 
thereof with counsel of the Indemnifying Partys choice; provided, however
, that the Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to assume the 
defense of any Third Party Claim to the extent (but only to the extent) 
such Third Party Claim (i) relates to any actual or alleged criminal 
proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation or (ii) seeks 
an injunction or equitable relief against the Indemnified Party that is not 
merely ancillary to the principal damages sought in the relevant claim. So 
long as the Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party, as applicable, has 
assumed the defense, appeal or settlement proceedings of the Third Party 
Claim in accordance herewith, (1) the other such party may retain separate 
co-counsel at the controlling partys cost and expense and participate in 
(but not control) the defense, appeal or settlement proceedings of the 
Third Party Claim, (2) the controlling party will not admit any liability, 
file any papers or consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any 
settlement agreement, compromise or discharge with respect to the Third 
Party Claim without the prior written consent of the other such party and 
(3) the controlling party will not admit to any wrongdoing by the other 
such party. The controlling party shall have the right to settle any Third 
Party Claim for which it obtains a full release of the other such party 
with respect to such Third Party Claim or to which settlement the 
Indemnified Party consents in writing (such consent not to be unreasonably 
withheld, conditioned or delayed). The parties will act in good faith in 
responding to, defending against, settling or otherwise dealing with Third 
Party Claims. The parties will also cooperate in any such defense, appeal 
or settlement proceedings, and give each other reasonable access to all

------------------------------------------------------------------------
information relevant thereto. Whether or not the Indemnifying Party has 
assumed the defense, appeal or settlement proceedings with respect to a 
Third Party Claim, such Indemnifying Party will not be obligated to 
indemnify the Indemnified Party hereunder for any settlement entered into 
or any judgment that was consented to without the Indemnifying Partys 
prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, 
conditioned or delayed). The party assuming such defense, appeal or 
settlement proceedings shall keep the other party reasonably advised of the 
status of such Third Party Claim and the defense thereof and shall 
reasonably consider recommendations made by the other party with respect 
thereto.

(b) Other Claims. An Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party 
written notice of any matter that an Indemnified Party has determined has 
given or could give rise to a right of indemnification under this 
Agreement, within 30 days of such determination, stating the amount of the 
Loss, if known, and the method of computation thereof, and containing a 
reference to the provisions of this Agreement in respect of which such 
right of indemnification is claimed or arises. It is the express intention 
of the parties that the indemnification provided for in this Article VII 
shall apply to direct claims between the parties for a breach of this 
Agreement (whether or not involving a third party).

SECTION 7.04. Limitations on Indemnification. Notwithstanding anything to 
the contrary contained in this Agreement, (i) Sellers aggregate maximum 
liability under Section 7.01(a) shall not exceed an amount equal to the 
Purchase Price with exception of Section 3.08 (API), Sellers aggregate 
maximum liability under 3.08 (API) shall not exceed $612,000; (ii) no party 
shall have any liability for an otherwise indemnifiable Loss that is 
contingent unless and until such contingent Loss becomes an actual Loss of 
the Indemnified Party and is due and payable, so long as the claim for such 
Loss was timely submitted pursuant to the provisions of this Article VII; 
(iii) no party shall be liable for any Losses to the extent the Purchaser 
Indemnitees or the Seller Indemnitees, as applicable, failed to mitigate 
such Losses in accordance with applicable Laws; (iv) no party shall be 
liable for any Loss to the extent arising from any Law not in force on the 
date hereof or any change in Law which takes effect retroactively and (v) 
no party shall be liable for any otherwise indemnifiable Loss arising out 
of any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of 
such party unless a claim therefor is asserted with specificity and in 
writing by the Indemnified Party timely in accordance with Section 7.08, 
failing which such claim shall be waived and extinguished. The waiver of 
any condition to the Closing based on the accuracy of any representation or 
warranty or on the performance of or compliance with any covenant or 
agreement shall be deemed a waiver of the right to indemnification under 
this Article VII with respect to such representation or warranty, covenant, 
agreement or obligation. Notwithstanding any implication to the contrary 
contained in this Agreement, the limits on indemnification set forth in 
this Agreement shall not apply to any claims or Losses based on fraud or 
intentional misrepresentation.

SECTION 7.05. Calculation of Indemnity Payments.

(a) The amount of any Loss for which indemnification is provided under this 
Article VII shall be net of any amounts actually recovered by the 
Indemnified Party with respect to such

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Loss (including payments under insurance policies net of all increases in 
premiums and other costs of such insurance policies for pursuing a claim 
thereunder). For Section 3.08 (API), calculation of loss is based on the

SECTION 7.07. Tax Treatment of Indemnification. For all Tax purposes,

forth in such agreements and covenants. After the Closing, no party shall 
have any liability or obligation of any nature with respect to any 
representation, warranty, agreement or covenant after the termination 
thereof, with the exception of payment of the Purchase Price, unless a 
notice of a breach thereof giving rise to a right of indemnity shall have 
been given to the party against whom such indemnity may be sought prior to 
such time, in which case the representation, warranty, covenant or 
agreement which is the subject of such claim shall survive, to the extent 
of the claims described in the notice only, until such claim is resolved, 
whether or not the amount of the Losses resulting from such breach has been 
finally determined at the time the notice is given.

SECTION 7.09. No Setoff Rights. Neither party shall have any right of 
setoff of any amounts due and payable, or any Liabilities arising, under

by the parties or their respective affiliates against any other amounts due 
and payable, or any other Liabilities arising, under this Agreement, any 
Ancillary Agreement or any other agreement entered into by the parties or 
their respective affiliates. The payment obligations under each of this 
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements remain independent obligations of 
each party, irrespective of any amounts owed to any other party under this 
Agreement, the respective Ancillary Agreements or any other agreement 
entered into by the parties or their respective affiliates.

contemplated hereby exclusively in contract pursuant to the express terms 
and provisions of this Agreement, and the parties expressly disclaim that 
they are owed any duties or are entitled to any remedies not expressly set

to the substantive Laws of another jurisdiction.

has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

SECTION 8.12. Service of Process. Each of the parties consents to service 
of any process, summons, notice or document which may be served in any 
Proceeding in the United States District Court of Delaware, which service

transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or disputes relating hereto or 
thereto. Each party (a) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney 
of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other 
party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing 
waiver and (b) acknowledges that it and the other party hereto have been 
induced to enter into this Agreement by, among other things, the mutual 
waivers and certifications in this Section 8.13.

SECTION 8.14. Amendments and Waivers. This Agreement may be amended, 
modified, superseded or canceled and any of the terms, covenants, 
representations, warranties or conditions hereof may be waived only by an 
instrument in writing signed by each of the parties or, in the case of a 
waiver, by or on behalf of the party waiving compliance. No course of 
dealing between the parties shall be effective to amend or waive any 
provision of this Agreement.

SECTION 8.15. Specific Performance. The parties agree that irreparable 
damage would occur in the event that the parties do not perform their 
obligations under the provisions of this Agreement in accordance with its 
specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. The parties 
acknowledge and agree that (a) the parties shall be entitled to an 
injunction or injunctions, specific performance or other equitable relief 
to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms 
and provisions hereof in any court of competent jurisdiction without proof 
of damages or otherwise, this being in addition to any other remedy to 
which they are entitled under this Agreement and (b) the right of specific 
enforcement is an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this 
Agreement and without that right, neither Seller nor Purchaser would have 
entered into this Agreement. The parties agree not to assert that a remedy 
of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or 
inequitable for any reason, and not to assert that a remedy of monetary 
damages would provide an adequate remedy or that the parties otherwise have 
an adequate remedy at law. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that 
any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this 
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this 
Agreement in accordance with this Section 8.15 shall not be required to 
provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or 
injunction.

SECTION 8.16. Joint Drafting. The parties hereto have been represented by 
counsel in the negotiations and preparation of this Agreement; therefore, 
this Agreement will be deemed to be drafted by each of the parties hereto, 
and no rule of construction will be invoked respecting the authorship of 
this Agreement.

SECTION 8.17. Fulfillment of Obligations. Any obligation of any party to 
any other party under this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements, 
which obligation is performed, satisfied or fulfilled completely by an 
affiliate of such party, shall be deemed to have been performed, satisfied 
or fulfilled by such party.
