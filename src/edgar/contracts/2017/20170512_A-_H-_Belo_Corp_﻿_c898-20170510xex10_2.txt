    Termination of employment

    Your right, if any, to payment with respect to your time-based RSUs
    upon termination of employment with the Company or its subsidiaries is
    set forth in the termination guidelines attached to this Evidence of
    Grant.

    Change in Control

    In the event of a Change in Control as defined in the Plan, all RSUs
    will vest immediately.  Vested RSUs will be paid at the earliest
    practicable date that payment may be made without violating any
    applicable provisions of section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code.

    Section 409A Payment Rules

    Notwithstanding the general payment rules described in this Evidence of
    Grant, if the Company makes a good faith determination that a payment
    of your long term incentive (LTI) (i) constitutes a deferral of
    compensation for purposes of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code
    of 1986, as amended, and the rules, regulations and guideline
    thereunder (“Section 409A”), (ii) is made to you by reason of your
    separation from service within the meaning of Section 409A, and (iii)
    at the time such payment would otherwise be made you are a specified
    employee within the meaning of Section 409A (using the identification
    methodology selected by the Company from time to time), the payment
    will be delayed until the earlier of (x) the first business day of the
    seventh month following your separation from service or (y) your death.
     Furthermore, if your LTI is no longer subject to a substantial risk of
    forfeiture prior to a Change in Control, and the Change in Control does
    not constitute a change in the ownership or effective control of the
    Company or in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of
    the Company (within the meaning of Section 409A), the payment date of
    the LTI will be determined without regard to the occurrence of the
    Change in Control.  Each payment of a portion of your LTI will be
    considered, and is hereby designated as, a separate payment for
    purposes of Section 409A.

    It is the Company’s intention that the LTI will either be exempt from,
    or will satisfy the requirements of, Section 409A, and this Evidence of
    Grant will be construed in a manner to give effect to such intention. 
    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Evidence of Grant, the
    Company is not obligated to guarantee any particular tax result for you
    with respect to any payment provided to you hereunder, and you will be
    responsible for any taxes imposed on you with respect to any such
    payment.

    Tax Withholding

    The Company will withhold from any payment to you all federal, state,
    city or other taxes as may be required to be withheld pursuant to any
    law or governmental regulation or ruling. 

    General Information

    Your right to receive an LTI grant or any payment with respect thereto
    will not be transferrable or assignable by you, other than with respect
    to a transfer upon your death by will or the laws of descent and
    distribution if you are entitled to payment of a vested portion of your
    LTI that has not been paid as of the date of your death.

    Nothing contained in this Evidence of Grant will confer upon you any
    right to be employed by or remain employed by the Company or any of its
    subsidiaries or affiliates, or limit or affect in any manner the

     
     
    --------------------------------------------------------------------

     

    right of the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates to terminate
    your employment or modify your compensation.

    This document will in all respects be interpreted, governed by and
    construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas, without
    regard to its conflict of laws rules

    If you have questions concerning this grant, please contact [name] at 
    [phone number].
