AGREEMENTS

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements, covenants, and 
conditions in this Agreement contained, Gatherer and Shipper hereby agree 
to amend and restate the Original Agreement in its entirety as follows:


ARTICLE 1
DEFINITIONS; RULES OF CONSTRUCTION

Section 1.1    Definitions. As used in this Agreement, capitalized words 
and terms shall have the meaning ascribed to such terms in Appendix II 
attached hereto.

Section 1.2    References and Rules of Construction. All references in this 
Agreement to Exhibits, Appendices, Articles, Sections, subsections and 
other subdivisions refer to the corresponding Exhibits, Appendices, 
Articles, Sections, subsections and other subdivisions of or to this 
Agreement unless expressly provided otherwise. Titles appearing at the 
beginning of any Articles, Sections, subsections and other subdivisions of 
this Agreement are for convenience only, do not constitute any part of this 
Agreement, and shall be disregarded in construing the language hereof. The 
words this Agreement, herein, hereby, hereunder and hereof, and 
words of similar import, refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any 
particular Article, Section, subsection or other subdivision unless 
expressly so limited. The word including (in its various forms) means 
including without limitation. All references to $ or dollars shall be 
deemed references to United States dollars. Each accounting term not 
defined herein will have the meaning given to it under generally accepted 
accounting principles. Pronouns in masculine, feminine or neuter genders 
shall be construed to state and include any other gender, and words, terms 
and titles (including terms defined herein) in the singular form shall be 
construed to include the plural and vice versa, unless the context 
otherwise requires. References to any Law means such Law as it may be 
amended from time to time.


ARTICLE 2
GATHERING SYSTEM; TERM

Section 2.1    Gathering System. The Gathering System means all of the 
Subsystems, collectively (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any 
Subsystem Extensions with respect thereto). As of January 1, 2017, there 
are three existing Subsystems: (a) the Goliath Subsystem, which is the 
existing Gas gathering system owned by Gatherer and more particularly 
described on Exhibit A-1; (b) the Hawkeye Subsystem, which is the 
existing Gas gathering system owned by Gatherer and more particularly 
described on Exhibit A-2; and (c) the Red Sky Subsystem, which is the 
existing Gas gathering system owned by Gatherer and more particularly 
described on Exhibit A-3, in each case, as such Subsystems may be modified 
and/or extended from time to time, including pursuant to a Subsystem 
Extension. As of January 1, 2017, each Subsystem contains certain Liquids 
Lines that are existing Injected Liquids and Drip Liquids transportation 
lines owned by Gatherer and more particularly described on Exhibit A-4, in 
each case, as such Liquids Lines may be modified and/or extended from time 
to time, including pursuant to a Subsystem Extension for the relevant 
Subsystem to which such Liquids Lines are connected.

Section 2.2    Term. Subject to earlier termination pursuant to Section 
10.1 (a) this Agreement shall commence at the Effective Time and shall 
remain in effect until the 10th anniversary of the Effective Time (the 
Initial Term), (b) Gatherer shall have the option, exercisable by the 
delivery of written Notice to Shipper on or before the date that is three 
Years

TERMS IN THIS EXHIBIT HAVE BEEN REDACTED BECAUSE CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT FOR 
THOSE TERMS HAS BEEN REQUESTED. THE REDACTED MATERIAL HAS BEEN FILED 
SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, AND THE TERMS HAVE 
BEEN MARKED AT THE APPROPRIATE PLACE WITH TWO ASTERISKS (**).
 
prior to the expiration of the Initial Term, to renew this Agreement for 
one additional ten Year period (such second ten Year period, the 
Secondary Term), and (c) thereafter, this Agreement shall automatically 
renew for successive Yearly periods unless terminated by either Party 
through the delivery of written Notice to the other Party on or before the 
date that is 180 Days prior to the end of the Secondary Term or the 
then-current Yearly term, as applicable (the Initial Term, the Secondary 
Term and any subsequent Yearly renewal periods, collectively, the Term). 
Should Gatherer elect to renew this Agreement for the Secondary Term 
pursuant to this Section 2.2, then, upon the beginning of the Secondary 
Term (and thereafter during the Term of this Agreement), the provisions of 
Section 7.1(i) and Exhibit G-3 shall be applicable hereunder. For the 
avoidance of doubt, during the Initial Term the provisions of Section 
7.1(i) and Exhibit G-3 shall not be applicable hereunder.


ARTICLE 3
SYSTEM SERVICES

Section 3.1    System Services. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement 
and rights of all applicable Governmental Authorities, during the Term, 
Gatherer shall provide, or cause to be provided, the following services 
with respect to Shipper Gas, in each case, in accordance with the terms and 
conditions of this Agreement (collectively, the System Services):

(a)    Gathering Services, which means: (i) the receipt of Shipper Gas 
Tendered by or on behalf of Shipper at the Receipt Points (other than the 
Injection Points); (ii) the gathering of such Shipper Gas; (iii) the 
receipt of Shipper Injected Liquids Tendered by or on behalf of Shipper at 
the Injection Points; (iv) the redelivery of Gas and, subject to Section 
3.3, Drip Liquids at the relevant Delivery Points (as nominated by Shipper) 
for Shippers account, with an equivalent Thermal Content to such Shipper 
Gas, less System Fuel and Losses allocated to Shipper in accordance with 
this Agreement; (v) the redelivery of Injected Liquids at the relevant 
Delivery Points (as nominated by Shipper) for Shippers account, with an 
equivalent Thermal Content to such Shipper Injected Liquids, less System 
Fuel and Losses allocated to Shipper in accordance with this Agreement; and 
(vi) the metering of such Shipper Gas and Shipper Injected Liquids at the 
Receipt Points (including the Injection Points, as applicable) and Delivery 
Points;

(b)    Compression Services, which means the combined dehydrating and 
compressing, to applicable tariff requirements, of Shipper Gas on the 
Gathering System; and

(c)    those other services to be performed by Gatherer in respect of 
Shipper Gas and Shipper Injected Liquids as set forth in this Agreement.

Section 3.2    Services Standard. Gatherer agrees to own, operate, and 
maintain, at its sole cost, risk and expense, the Gathering System and the 
other facilities, in each case, necessary to provide the System Services 
contemplated in this Agreement in accordance with the then-current 
Development Plan and Gathering System Plan and in a good and workmanlike 
manner in accordance with standards customary in the industry in the 
geographic area where the Gathering System is located.

THOSE TERMS HAS BEEN REQUESTED. THE REDACTED MATERIAL HAS BEEN FILED 
SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, AND THE TERMS HAVE 
BEEN MARKED AT THE APPROPRIATE PLACE WITH TWO ASTERISKS (**).
 
Section 3.3    Drip Liquids. The Parties acknowledge and agree that Drip 
Liquids may result from the normal operation of the Gathering System and 
the provision of the System Services to Shipper Gas hereunder. Such Drip 
Liquids shall be collected by Gatherer at various collection points, 
including drip pots, dew-pointing locations, compressor inlet receivers, 
and pigging collection points, located on each Subsystem (each, a Drip 
Point).

(a)    To the extent that any Drip Liquids allocated to Shipper in 
accordance with this Agreement and collected at a Drip Point are able to be 
re-delivered by Gatherer via the Liquids Lines from such Drip Point to the 
applicable Delivery Point nominated by Shipper, such Drip Liquids shall be 
so re-delivered by Gatherer.

(b)    Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that any Drip Liquids 
allocated to Shipper in accordance with this Agreement and collected at a 
Drip Point are not able to be re-delivered by Gatherer via the Liquids 
Lines to the applicable Delivery Point nominated by Shipper, then (i) 
Gatherer shall have no further obligation to gather or transport such Drip 
Liquids, (ii) regardless of the Delivery Point nominated by Shipper with 
respect to such Drip Liquids, the applicable Drip Point shall be deemed to 
be the Delivery Point with respect to such Drip Liquids, and (iii) Shipper 
shall have the obligation to provide the means to transport such Drip 
Liquids away from such Drip Points promptly upon such Drip Liquids being 
collected at such Drip Points.

Section 3.4    Exchange of Information. Each Party agrees to use its 
reasonable efforts to provide, on a timely basis, such information to the 
other Party as may be reasonably needed by such other Party to perform its 
obligations hereunder (including, in the case of Gatherer, to provide the 
System Services hereunder).

Section 3.5    Reports. Gatherer shall file all necessary reports and/or 
notices required by applicable Laws with respect to the performance by 
Gatherer of the System Services pursuant to this Agreement.


ARTICLE 4
DEDICATION OF PRODUCTION

Section 4.1    Dedication.

(a)    Subject to the provisions of Section 4.1 through Section 4.4 and 
Article 17, Shipper exclusively dedicates and commits to deliver to 
Gatherer under this Agreement all:

(i)    Shipper Gas formerly owned or Controlled by Producer and produced 
from those oil and gas properties located in the area described on Exhibit 
B-1 (such area, as the same may be modified from time to time by the 
Parties hereunder, the Dedicated Area) that are operated by Producer or 
that are not operated by Producer, but from which Producer has elected to 
take its applicable production in-kind (such Gas, Dedicated Producer Gas
); and

contracts described on Exhibit B-2, which Exhibit shall be updated at least 
annually by the Parties as part of the Development Plan and Gathering 
System Plan processes pursuant to Article 5 (such contracts, the 
Dedicated Contracts). Pending any formal amendment of Exhibit B-2 to 
update the list of Dedicated Contracts contained thereon, the Parties 
acknowledge and agree that Shipperss delivery of Notice to Provider 
pursuant to Section 19.2 indicating Shippers intent to dedicate a contract 
to Provider under this Agreement as a Dedicated Contract shall be 
sufficient to classify (A) such contract as a Dedicated Contract for all 
purposes hereunder until Exhibit B-2 is formally amended to include the 
same, and (B) all volumes owned or Controlled by Shipper pursuant to such 
contract and delivered to Provider hereunder (to the extent such volumes 
were delivered from and after the last update of Exhibit B-2 and prior to 
the delivery of such written notice or after the delivery of such written 
notice) as Dedicated Production for all purposes hereunder.

Gathering System Plan for the purpose of providing System Services in 
accordance with this Agreement.

(b)    Gatherer is responsible, at its sole cost, for the acquisition and 
maintenance of rights of way, surface use and/or surface access agreements 
necessary to construct, own and operate the Gathering System and provide 
the System Services hereunder (including any Committed Build-Outs); 
provided, however, that in the event (i) any right of way, surface use 
and/or surface access agreement necessary to construct, own or operate any 
Committed Build-Out cannot be obtained by Gatherer on terms and conditions 
reasonably acceptable to Gatherer, and (ii) Shipper cannot facilitate 
Gatherers receipt of any such necessary right of way, surface use and/or 
surface access agreement on terms and conditions reasonably acceptable to 
Gatherer, then Gatherer shall not be obligated to complete such Committed 
Build-Out. Gatherer agrees to provide Shipper with quarterly updates as to 
the progress of any then-approved Committed Build-Outs. Additionally, 
should Gatherer reasonably believe that any Committed Build-Out will not be 
completed and placed in-service by the applicable Target Completion Date 
reflected in the applicable Gathering System Plan, Gatherer shall send 
written Notice to Shipper of such delay promptly upon Gatherers 
determination that such delay will be reasonably likely to occur.

BEEN MARKED AT THE APPROPRIATE PLACE WITH TWO ASTERISKS (**).
 
(c)    The Parties agree to work together in good faith to obtain the 
necessary permits and authorizations from the appropriate Governmental 
Authorities and the necessary consents, rights of way and other 
authorizations from other Persons necessary to construct, own and operate 
each Committed Build-Out as expeditiously as reasonably practicable. The 
Parties further agree to cooperate with each other and to communicate 
regularly regarding their efforts to obtain such permits, authorizations,

(d)    Upon the completion of any Committed Build-Out constituting a 
Planned Receipt Point or a Planned Delivery Point, the Parties shall amend 
Exhibit H or Exhibit I, as applicable, to include such new Receipt Point or 
Delivery Point.


ARTICLE 6
MINIMUM VOLUME COMMITMENT; SHORTFALL CREDITS

Section 6.1    MVC. For each Quarter during the Term, Shipper shall be 
obligated to Tender for delivery into each Subsystem a minimum volume of 
Shipper Gas (each such minimum amount with respect to each Subsystem, a 
Minimum Volume Commitment or MVC). The MVCs for each Subsystem for the 
Quarters occurring in Year 2017 are set forth on Exhibit F attached hereto. 
Following Year 2016, the MVCs with respect to each Subsystem for any 
Quarter occurring in the then-subsequent three Year period shall be equal 
to 80% of the applicable Dedicated Production Estimate for such Quarter and 
such Subsystem contained in the then-currently agreed Development Plan. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing and regardless of the Dedicated Production 
Estimates with respect to any such Quarter included in any Updated 
Development Plan thereafter, the MVC for such Quarter and Subsystem 
contained in any prior Development Plan shall not be reduced by such 
Updated Development Plan (but the applicable MVC volumes may be increased). 
Should any Dedicated Production be released (either permanently or 
temporarily) from the dedication contained in this Agreement pursuant to 
Section 4.4, the then-applicable MVC shall be proportionately reduced by 
the portion of the then-current Dedicated Production Estimate so released. 
Should any such temporary release from dedication expire, then, upon such 
expiration, the then-applicable MVC shall be proportionately increased by 
the portion of the applicable Dedicated Production Estimate that is no 
longer released from dedication hereunder.

(a)    Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, with respect to all 
periods prior to January 1, 2017, the definition of MVC contained in the 
Original Agreement and the MVC mechanisms contained in Section 6.1 of the 
Original Agreement shall, in each case, remain applicable hereunder.

Section 6.2    MVC Shortfall Credits. If Shipper pays any Shortfall Fee 
with respect to any Quarter in the Secondary Term or thereafter, then, 
subject to the other provisions of this Section 6.2, for a period of four 
full Quarters from the end of the Quarter in which such Shortfall Fee was 
accrued, Shipper shall be entitled to a credit with respect to the Fees 
payable by Shipper during any such Quarter in connection with volumes of 
Shipper Gas Tendered by Shipper or for Shippers account into the Receipt 
Points attributable to the applicable Subsystem for which such Shortfall 
Fee was incurred during any such Quarter, but only to the extent such 
volumes are in excess of the applicable Dedicated Production Estimate for 
such Subsystem and such Quarter (each such volume credit, stated in Mcfs, a 
MVC Shortfall Credit).

(a)    During any subsequent Quarter in which an earned MVC Shortfall 
Credit may be utilized by Shipper, Shipper may only utilize such MVC 
Shortfall Credit for volumes of Shipper Gas delivered into the applicable 
Subsystem in excess of the applicable Dedicated Production Estimate for 
such Subsystem and such Quarter as contained in the then-currently agreed 
Development Plan.

(b)    The use of a MVC Shortfall Credit shall result in Shipper not being 
obligated to pay any Fee attributable to volumes of Shipper Gas, stated in 
Mcfs, delivered into the Receipt Points applicable to such Subsystem, but 
only up to the amount of such MVC Shortfall Credit and only with respect to 
volumes of Shipper Gas in excess of the applicable Dedicated Production 
Estimate for such Subsystem and such Quarter as contained in the 
then-currently agreed Development Plan.

(c)    Each MVC Shortfall Credit shall expire at the end of the fourth full 
Quarter following the date on which the applicable Shortfall Fee was 
accrued.

(d)    Gatherer shall be responsible for keeping records and balances of 
any applicable MVC Shortfall Credits that have been earned by Shipper and 
providing such balances to Shipper upon Shippers request.

(e)    The Parties agree that, as of December 31, 2016, there shall be no 
outstanding MVC Shortfall Credits (as such term is defined in the 
Original Agreement), and any such amounts that (i) have accrued on or prior 
to December 31, 2016 pursuant to the Original Agreement, but (ii) have not 
(or cannot) be utilized by Shipper hereunder with respect to Shipper Gas 
Tendered to the Gathering System prior to December 31, 2016, shall be of no 
further force and effect and shall not be given any application hereunder. 
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary but subject to the first 
sentence of this Section 6.2(e), with respect to all periods prior to 
January 1, 2017, the definition of MVC Shortfall Credits contained in the 
Original Agreement and the MVC Shortfall Credit mechanisms contained in 
Section 6.2 and elsewhere of the Original Agreement shall, in each case, 
remain applicable hereunder.

Gathering Fee.

For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to 
the contrary, in no event shall any MCFE of Shipper Injected Liquids be 
charged a Gathering Fee if (x) such volume of Shipper Injected Liquids was 
redelivered to Shipper by Gatherer at a Drip Point as Drip Liquids (as the 
applicable Delivery Point for such Drip Liquids) pursuant to Section 3.3 
and (y) such Drip Liquids are later Tendered by Shipper or for Shippers 
account for reinjection into the Gathering System at an Injection Point.

(b)    Each Month, Shipper shall pay to Gatherer the following fees in 
accordance with the terms of this Agreement for the Compression Services 
provided by Gatherer with respect to Shipper Gas received by Gatherer from 
Shipper or for Shippers account during such Month:

For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall any Mcf of Shipper Gas be 
charged more than one Compression Fee for the utilization by such Mcf of 
Gas of the Compression Services.

(c)    For any Quarter, should Shipper fail to Tender an aggregate volume 
of Shipper Gas to Gatherer at the Receipt Points for any Subsystem equal to 
the Goliath MVC, the Hawkeye MVC or the Red Sky MVC, as applicable, for 
such Quarter, then Shipper shall pay to Gatherer the following fees in 
accordance with the terms of this Agreement as a result of such shortfall 
(such fee, a Shortfall Fee): (i) (A) the then-applicable MVC for such 
Subsystem, minus (B) the aggregate volumes, stated in Mcfs, of Shipper Gas 
actually delivered into such Subsystem at the applicable Receipt Points by 
Shipper or for Shippers account during such Quarter, minus (C) the 
aggregate volumes, stated in Mcfs, of Dedicated Production Tendered for 
delivery by Shipper or on Shippers account into such Subsystem at the 
applicable Receipt Points during such Quarter but not received into the 
Gathering System by Gatherer due to reasons of Force Majeure or 
curtailment, minus (D) the aggregate volumes, stated in Mcfs, of Dedicated 
Producer Gas not Tendered for delivery by Shipper or on Shippers account 
into such Subsystem at the applicable Receipt Points during such Quarter 
due to reasons of a Force Majeure event affecting Shipper that Gatherer has 
accepted as a Force Majeure event hereunder, multiplied by (ii) (A) the 
Gathering Fee applicable to such Subsystem, plus (B) the Compression Fee 
applicable to such Subsystem.

(d)    If any Updated Development Plan contains, for any Year, a System 
Production Estimate that is at least 15% greater than the System Production 
Estimate for such Year contained in the most recent previously agreed-upon 
Development Plan, then Gatherer shall have the right, at its sole 
discretion, to elect to permanently increase the Return on Capital by two 
percent (2%) for each 15% increase represented by such System Production 
Estimate. Such right must be exercised by Gatherer prior to the start of 
the Year to which such Updated Development Plan that triggered the 
provisions of this Section 7.1(d) first applies, and absent such exercise 
by Gatherer such right to increase the Return on Capital shall be deemed 
waived by Gatherer.

(e)    (x) at any time on or prior to January 15th of each Year, either 
Party may make an election to have the then-currently agreed Fees 
recalculated with respect to such Year (a Recalculation Election); 
provided, that, prior to the date such Recalculation Election is made, the 
Parties shall have agreed upon an Updated Development Plan for such Year or 
the Parties shall have been unable to agree upon an Updated Development 
Plan for such Year, and (y) Shipper shall have the right, in accordance 
with Section 4.4(a)(i), to make a temporary Recalculation Election with 
respect to the remainder of the current Year. Upon a Recalculation Election 
being made pursuant to this Section 7.1(e), the Fees will be recalculated 
based upon such then-currently agreed Development Plan. Any such 
recalculation shall be based on the model attached hereto as Exhibit G-2, 
which takes into account:

(i)    the aggregate volumes of Dedicated Production (including volumes of 
Dedicated Production, Shipper Gas and Shipper Injected Liquids that Shipper

has not yet been amended pursuant to Section 4.1(a)(ii)) contained in a 
Dedicated Production Estimate that have actually been delivered by Shipper 
into the Receipt Points, in each case, prior to such Year during the Term; 
provided, however, that such aggregate volumes shall not, for purposes of 
the recalculation (A) exceed the applicable System Production Estimates for 
such Years as contained in the applicable Development Plans or (B) be 
deemed to be lower than the applicable MVC for such Years as contained in 
the applicable Development Plans;

(ii)    any Committed Build-Out Costs actually incurred by Gatherer prior 
to such Year during the Term, regardless whether or not such amounts are 
less than, equal to or greater than the applicable Committed Build-Out 
Estimates for such Years;

(iii)    the Committed Build-Out Estimates contained in the then-current 
System Budget for the current and future Years;

(iv)    the Maintenance Capital Estimates (A) for the previous Years of the 
Term as contained in the System Budgets applicable to such Years, and (B) 
contained in the then-current System Budget for the current and future 
Years;

(v)    the Operating Expense Estimates (A) for the previous Years of the 
Term as contained in the System Budgets applicable to such Years, and (B) 
contained in the then-current System Budget for the current and future 
Years;

(vi)    the Historical Capital Expenditures;

(vii)    the System Production Estimates;

(viii)    the then-current Return on Capital; and

(ix)    the percentage change, from the preceding Year, in the Consumer 
Price Index as published by the Department of Labor, in the subsection 
titled Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (such index, the 
CPI). For purposes of any Recalculation Election and notwithstanding 
anything in the foregoing to the contrary, (A) no increase or decrease to 
any Fee resulting solely from a CPI adjustment shall exceed 3.0% for any 
given Year, and (B) no Fee shall ever be decreased as a result of any 
applicable CPI percentage change below the original amount of such Fee set 
forth in Exhibit G-1 for Year 2014.

(f)    Except as set forth in Section 4.4(a)(i), any Fees recalculated 
under Section 7.1(e) shall apply as of January 1st of the Year to which the 
relevant Updated Development Plan leading to such Recalculation Election 
first applies, and shall remain in effect for the remainder of the Term 
until such Fees may subsequently be re-calculated pursuant to Section 
7.1(e).

(g)    For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties acknowledge that there is no 
separate Fee chargeable by Gatherer hereunder for System Services with 
respect to Drip Liquids (including any Drip Liquids that are subsequently 
reinjected into the Gathering System by Shipper as Shipper Injected 
Liquids) and that the Fees chargeable by Gatherer hereunder for Gas are 
sufficient to compensate Gatherer for System Services with respect to any 
Drip Liquids allocated to Shipper in accordance with this Agreement.

(h)    Following any (i) Recalculation Election made pursuant to Section 
7.1(e), (ii) determination of any Fee pursuant to Section 7.1(i) (once such 
Section of this Agreement becomes applicable hereunder), or (iii) other 
agreement by the Parties upon any changes to any Fee hereunder, whether 
such changes are agreed pursuant to an agreed Updated Development Plan and 
related updated Gathering System Plan or otherwise, in each case, the 
Parties shall update Exhibit G-1 to reflect such updated Fee amount(s).

(i)    Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, 
effective as of the first Year of the Secondary Term:

(i)    each Fee hereunder shall be recalculated for each Year, effective as 
of January 1 of each Year, in accordance with the provisions of Exhibit 
G-3 attached hereto; and

(ii)    the provisions of Section 5.2(b)(v), Section 7.1(d), Section 7.1(e) 
and Section 7.1(f) shall no longer be applicable hereunder and such 
Sections shall be disregarded for all purposes of this Agreement.

(j)    Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, with respect to all 
periods prior to January 1, 2017, the definition of Fee and its 
constituent sub-definitions contained in the Original Agreement and the Fee 
mechanisms set forth in Section 7.1(a) through 7.1(i) of the Original 
Agreement shall, in each case, remain applicable hereunder with respect to 
the System Services provided prior to January 1, 2017.

Section 7.2    Charges. Each Month, Shipper shall pay to Gatherer an amount 
equal to Shippers allocated portion of the actual costs incurred by 
Gatherer for electricity required for the ownership, maintenance and 
operation of each Subsystem, such allocation to be based upon the aggregate 
volumes of (a) Shipper Gas and Shipper Injected Liquids Tendered by Shipper 
at the applicable Receipt Points and received by Gatherer into such 
Subsystem during such Month, and (b) Non-Party Gas and Non-Party Injected 
Liquids other than Shipper Gas and Shipper Injected Liquids tendered by a 
Non-Party at the applicable Receipt Points and received by Gatherer into 
such Subsystem during such Month; provided, that costs for electricity 
required for compression will be allocated proportionately among only that 
Shipper Gas and Non-Party Gas that requires the use of such compression 
(such amount as allocated to Shipper for a Month, the Charges).

Section 7.3    Flaring. In the event that (a) any volume of Shipper Gas is 
flared after being delivered into the Gathering System, and (b) (i) such 
flaring was caused by the Operational Failure of the Gathering System or by 
the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Gatherer,

then Shipper shall (A) nevertheless be entitled to count such flared 
volumes of Shipper Gas as having been Tendered to the Gathering System for 
purposes of meeting any applicable MVC, and (B) shall not be required to 
pay any applicable Fees with respect to such flared volumes of Shipper Gas, 
such volumes of Gas for which Shipper is not obligated to pay Fees to be 
reflected in the applicable Invoice for such Month, or (ii) such flaring 
was caused by any other reason, then Shipper shall not be entitled to any 
credit or other reduction in Fees as a result of such flaring. 
Notwithstanding the above, the Parties shall use their commercially 
reasonable efforts to minimize overall flaring on the Gathering System.

Section 7.4    Gathering System L&U. Shipper acknowledges that certain 
volumetric losses of Shipper Gas and Shipper Injected Liquids will occur 
even if the System Services are conducted in accordance with the provisions 
of Section 3.2, and such losses attributable to Gathering System L&U shall 
be shared and allocated among all shippers on each Subsystem in the 
proportion that each such shipper Tenders Gas and Injected Liquids to the 
applicable Receipt Points on such Subsystem. Shippers allocated share of 
the Gathering System L&U for each Subsystem shall be based on actual losses 
attributable to Gathering System L&U on such Subsystem and shall not be 
subject to any minimum or maximum limits.

Section 7.5    Gathering System Fuel. Reductions in volumes of Shipper Gas 
due to the usage of Shipper Gas as measured Gathering System Fuel shall be 
shared and allocated among all shippers on each Subsystem in the proportion 
that each such shipper Tenders Gas to the applicable Receipt Points on such 
Subsystem. Shippers allocated share of the Gathering System Fuel for each 
Subsystem shall be based on actual usage of Gathering System Fuel on such 
Subsystem and shall not be subject to any minimum or maximum limits. For 
the avoidance of doubt, no residue gas utilized as fuel for the operation 
of the Gathering System shall be allocated to shippers on the Gathering 
System (including Shipper) and no shippers Gas volumes on the Gathering 
System (including Shippers) shall be reduced as a result of utilizing any 
such residue gas as fuel for the operation of the Gathering System.

Section 7.6    Drip Liquids. All Drip Liquids recovered at the Drip Points 
by Gatherer through the operation of the Gathering System and allocated to 
Shipper in accordance with this Agreement shall be the property of Shipper, 
and Gatherer shall have no claim of ownership with respect thereto.

(b)    All Additional Gas shall, only to the extent such volumes of 
Additional Gas (together with all quantities of Dedicated Production 
Tendered to the applicable Subsystem) are both (i) needed by Shipper to 
fulfill the then-applicable MVC for such Subsystem, and (ii) less than or 
equal to **% of the then-current total capacity of such Subsystem, be 
entitled to Anchor Shipper Firm Service.

(c)    All Additional Gas and Shipper Injected Liquids shall, to the extent 
such volumes of Additional Gas and Shipper Injected Liquids (together with 
all other quantities of Shipper Gas and Shipper Injected Liquids Tendered 
to the applicable Subsystem, including any Dedicated Production) are in 
excess of the then-applicable MVC for such Subsystem, but less than or 
equal to **% of the then-current total capacity of such Subsystem, be 
entitled to Firm Service.

(d)    All Additional Gas and Shipper Injected Liquids not described in 
subsections (b) through (c) above shall only be entitled to Interruptible 
Service.

Section 8.2    Governmental Action. In the event any Governmental Authority 
issues an order requiring Gatherer to allocate capacity on the Gathering 
System to another shipper, Gatherer shall do so by (a) first, reducing Gas 
and/or Injected Liquids, as applicable, entitled to Interruptible Service, 
(b) second, reducing Gas and/or Injected Liquids, as applicable, entitled 
to Firm Service, and shall only curtail receipts of Gas and/or Injected 
Liquids, as applicable, entitled to Firm Service (which curtailment shall 
be done in accordance with Section 8.5) to the extent necessary to allocate 
such capacity as required by the Governmental Authority to such other 
shipper, after complete curtailment of Interruptible Service, and (c) third
, reducing Gas entitled to Anchor Shipper Firm Service, and shall only 
curtail receipts of Gas entitled to Anchor Shipper Firm Service (which 
curtailment shall be done in accordance with Section 8.5) to the extent 
necessary to allocate such capacity as required by the Governmental 
Authority to such other shipper, after complete curtailment of 
Interruptible Service and Firm Service. In such event Gatherer shall not be 
in breach or default of its obligations under the Agreement and shall have 
no liability to Shipper in connection with or resulting from any such 
curtailment; provided, however, that Gatherer shall, at Shippers request, 
temporarily release from the dedication under this Agreement all of 
Shippers volumes of Dedicated Production interrupted or curtailed as the 
result of such allocation, but only for the duration of such mandated 
allocation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, should any Governmental 
Authority issue an order requiring Gatherer to allocate capacity on the 
Gathering System to a shipper other than Shipper, Gatherer agrees to use 
its commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with, and support, Shipper 
in such actions that Shipper may in good faith take against such 
Governmental Authority and/or order; provided, however, that Gatherer shall 
not be required to cooperate in any such undertaking that Gatherer, in its 
good faith opinion, believes would materially and adversely affect Gatherer 
or the Gathering System.

Section 8.3    Tender of Dedicated Production; Additional Gas and Shipper 
Injected Liquids. Subject to Article 14 and all applicable Laws, each Day 
during the Term Shipper shall Tender to the Gathering System at each 
applicable Receipt Point all of the Dedicated Production available to 
Shipper at such Receipt Point up to the applicable capacity of such Receipt 
Point. Shipper shall have the right to Tender to Gatherer for System 
Services under this Agreement Additional Gas and Shipper Injected Liquids; 
provided that, subject to Section 8.1, any such Additional Gas and Shipper 
Injected Liquids shall only be entitled to Interruptible Service unless 
otherwise agreed in writing by the Parties.

Section 8.5    Suspension/Shutdown of Service.

(a)    During any period when all or any portion of the Gathering System is 
shut down because of necessary maintenance, repairs or modifications or 
Force Majeure or because such shutdown is necessary to avoid injury or harm 
to persons, property, the environment, or the integrity of the Gathering 
System, receipts and/or deliveries of Gas (including any Drip Liquids 
allocated to Shipper in accordance with this Agreement) and/or Injected 
Liquids may be curtailed as set forth in Section 1.5 of the Operating 
Terms. In such cases, Gatherer shall have no liability to Shipper, except 
to the extent such shut down is caused by the gross negligence or willful 
misconduct of Gatherer (and then Gatherer shall have liability only to the 
extent of such gross negligence or willful misconduct).

(b)    Gatherer shall have the right to curtail or interrupt receipts and 
deliveries of Gas (including any Drip Liquids allocated to any shipper in 
accordance with this Agreement) and/or Injected Liquids for brief periods

operations of Shipper and (ii) schedule maintenance, repair, and 
modification operations on the Gathering System so as to avoid or minimize, 
to the greatest extent possible, service curtailments or interruptions on 
the Gathering System. Gatherer shall provide Shipper with (A) 30 Days prior 
Notice of any upcoming normal and routine maintenance, repair, and 
modification projects that Gatherer has planned that would result in a 
curtailment or interruption of Shippers deliveries of Gas (including any 
Drip Liquids allocated to Shipper in accordance with this Agreement) and/or 
Injected Liquids on the Gathering System and the estimated time period for 
such curtailment or interruption, whether or not such maintenance, repair 
or modifications activities are contained in the then-current System 
Budget, and (B) Notice of any amendment, modification or other change to 
the schedule of maintenance, repair or modifications activities contained 
in the then-current System Budget.

(c)    It is specifically understood by Shipper that operations and 
activities on facilities upstream or downstream of the Gathering System 
beyond Gatherers control may impact operations on the Gathering System, 
and the Parties agree that Gatherer shall have no liability therefor unless 
any such impact was caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of 
Gatherer (and then Gatherer shall have liability only to the extent of such 
gross negligence or willful misconduct). Shipper is required to obtain, 
maintain or otherwise secure capacity on or into the Downstream Facilities 
applicable to each Delivery Point that is sufficient to accommodate the 
volumes of Shipper Gas (including any Drip Liquids allocated to Shipper in

deliveries of Gas and/or Injected Liquids pursuant to this Section 8.5 
(other than Section 8.5(c)) for a period of 30 consecutive Days, then, at 
Shippers written request, the affected volumes of Dedicated Production 
shall be temporarily released from dedication to this Agreement for a 
period commencing as of the date of such request and ending as of the next 
first Day of a Month following the expiration date of Shippers mitigating 
commercial arrangement for such Dedicated Production; provided that, in any 
event, such period shall end no more than 180 Days following Shippers 
receipt of Notice from Gatherer that such receipts and deliveries are no 
longer interrupted or curtailed.

Section 8.6    Gas Marketing and Transportation. As between the Parties, 
Shipper shall be solely responsible for, and shall make all necessary 
arrangements at and downstream of the Delivery Points for, receipt, further 
transportation, processing, and marketing of Shipper Gas (including any 
Drip Liquids allocated to Shipper in accordance with this Agreement) and 
Shipper Injected Liquids.

Section 8.7    Downstream Delivery Points. Gatherer shall use its

Section 10.1    Termination.

(a)    This Agreement may be terminated in its entirety as follows:

(i)    by Gatherer upon written Notice to Shipper, if Shipper fails to pay 
pursuant to Section 12.2 any Invoice rendered pursuant to Section 12.1 and 
such failure is not remedied within 30 Days of written Notice of such 
failure to Shipper by Gatherer;

(ii)    by one Party upon written Notice to the other Party, if such second 
Party fails to perform or comply with any material warranty, covenant or 
obligation contained in this Agreement (other than (A) as provided above in 
Section 10.1(a)(i), (B) for reasons of Force Majeure in accordance with 
Article 14, or (C) with respect to any material warranty, covenant or 
obligation contained in this Agreement for which this Agreement expressly 
sets forth a specific remedy or consequence (other than termination) as a 
result of any breach of, or failure to comply with, such material warranty, 
covenant or obligation), and such failure has not been remedied within 60 
Days after receipt of written Notice from the non-defaulting Party of such 
failure;

(iii)    by Gatherer upon written Notice to Shipper, if Shipper or Shipper 
Parent (A) makes an assignment or any general arrangement for the benefit 
of creditors, (B) files a petition or otherwise commences, authorizes, or 
acquiesces in the commencement of a proceeding or cause under any 
bankruptcy or similar Law for the protection of creditors or has such 
petition filed or proceeding commenced against either of them, or (C) 
otherwise becomes bankrupt or insolvent (however evidenced);

(iv)    by Gatherer upon written Notice to Shipper pursuant to the 
provisions of Section 15.4(c); and

(v)    by Gatherer upon written Notice to Shipper pursuant to the 
provisions of Section 18.2.

(b)    This Agreement may be terminated with respect to any Subsystem if 
such Subsystem is Uneconomic during any six consecutive Months, by Gatherer 
upon written Notice to Shipper delivered within 180 Days following the end 
of such sixth consecutive Month.

(i)    As used herein, Uneconomic means that (A) the total direct 
operating costs and expenses incurred by Gatherer in the operation of such 
Subsystem (including general and administrative expenses, insurance costs 
and any out of pocket repair and/or maintenance costs and expenses) exceeds 
(B) the total net revenues received by Gatherer for the operation of such 
Subsystem, all as determined in accordance with United States generally 
accepted accounting principles.

(ii)    Should Gatherer reasonably believe that any Subsystem will be 
Uneconomic for more than three consecutive Months, Gatherer shall advise 
Shipper of such belief and shall provide Shipper with supporting 
documentation reasonably necessary to confirm such Uneconomic status.

(iii)    Promptly following Gatherer advising Shipper of such potential 
Uneconomic status, the Parties shall meet to discuss Gatherers belief and 
related calculations and any measures that may be taken by the Parties to 
mitigate and/or reverse the Uneconomic status of such Subsystem.

(iv)    Should (A) the Parties fail to reach agreement upon any such 
appropriate mitigation measures prior to the date upon which Gatherer would 
otherwise be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 
10.1(b), (B) the Parties reasonably believe that agreement upon such 
mitigation measures will nevertheless be possible, and (C) Shipper makes 
Gatherer whole during any such Uneconomic periods occurring during such 
negotiation period such that, due to Shippers payment efforts, the 
operation of such Subsystem is not Uneconomic to Gatherer (whether through 
Shipper paying of the operating costs of such Subsystem or otherwise), then 
for so long as subparts (B) and (C) of this Section 10.1(b)(iv) remain 
true, Gatherer shall not be entitled to exercise its termination rights 
pursuant to this Section 10.1(b).

(v)    Upon the implementation of any such mitigating measures hereunder, 
should (A) the Uneconomic condition cease to exist for three consecutive 
Months, and (B) the reversion of any such mitigating measures not be 
reasonably likely to cause such Uneconomic condition to return, then any 
terms of this Agreement affected by such mitigating measures will revert 
back to the terms in effect prior to Gatherers declaration of Uneconomic 
status pursuant to this Section 10.1(b).


Section 10.2    Effect of Termination or Expiration of the Term.

(a)    Upon the end of the Term (whether pursuant to a termination pursuant 
to Section 10.1(a) or otherwise), this Agreement shall forthwith become 
void and the Parties shall have no liability or obligation under this 
Agreement, except that (i) the termination of this Agreement shall not 
relieve any Party from any expense, liability or other obligation or remedy

termination, and (ii) the provisions of Section 16.2 through Section 16.5, 
and Article 19 (other than Section 19.3), and such portions of Appendix II 
as are necessary to give effect to the foregoing, shall, in each case, 
survive such termination and remain in full force and effect indefinitely.

(b)    Upon the termination of this Agreement with respect to a certain 
Subsystem pursuant to Section 10.1(b), this Agreement shall, only with 
respect to such Subsystem, forthwith become void and the Parties shall have 
no liability or obligation under this Agreement with respect to such 
Subsystem, except that (i) the termination of this Agreement with respect 
to such Subsystem shall not relieve any Party from any expense, liability 
or other obligation or remedy therefor which has accrued or attached prior

TITLE AND CUSTODY

Section 11.1    Title. The act of Tendering Gas and/or Injected Liquids to 
the Receipt Points by Shipper shall be deemed a warranty of title to such 
Gas (including any Drip Liquids allocated to Shipper in accordance with 
this Agreement) and/or Injected Liquids by Shipper, or a warranty of the 
right of Shipper to deliver such Gas (including any Drip Liquids allocated 
to Shipper in accordance with this Agreement) and/or Injected Liquids for

all Losses resulting from any claims by a Non-Party of title or rights to 
such Gas (including any Drip Liquids allocated to Shipper in accordance 
with this Agreement) and/or Injected Liquids, other than any claims arising 
out of Gatherers breach of its warranty made in the succeeding sentence of 
this Section 11.1. By receiving Shipper Gas and/or Shipper Injected Liquids 
at the Receipt Points, Gatherer (a) warrants to Shipper that Gatherer has 
the right to accept and redeliver such Gas (including any Drip Liquids 
allocated to Shipper in accordance with this Agreement) and/or Injected 
Liquids, less any System Fuel and Losses, free and clear of any title 
disputes, liens or encumbrances arising by, through or under Gatherer, but 
not otherwise, and (b) agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Shipper 
harmless from any and all Losses resulting from title disputes, liens or 
encumbrances arising by, through or under Gatherer, but not otherwise. 
Title to Shippers share of System Fuel and Losses shall be transferred to 
Gatherer at the Receipt Points.

Section 11.2    Custody. From and after the delivery of Shipper Gas and/or 
Shipper Injected Liquids to Gatherer at the Receipt Point(s), until 
Gatherers redelivery of such Gas (including any Drip Liquids allocated to 
Shipper in accordance with this Agreement) and/or Injected Liquids to or 
for Shippers account at the applicable Delivery Point(s), as between the 
Parties, Gatherer shall have custody and control of such Gas (including any 
Drip Liquids allocated to Shipper in accordance with this Agreement) and/or 
Injected Liquids. In all other circumstances, as between the Parties, 
Shipper shall be deemed to have custody and control of such Gas (including 
any Drip Liquids allocated to Shipper in accordance with this Agreement) 
and/or Injected Liquids.

BILLING AND PAYMENT

Section 12.1    Invoices. On or before the 25th Day of each Month, Gatherer 
will render to Shipper an invoice, divided out on a Subsystem-by-Subsystem 
basis (each, an Invoice), for all Fees (including the calculations 
thereof) owed for System Services provided to Shipper for the preceding 
Month, all Charges attributable to the preceding Month and any other 
amounts as may be due under this Agreement for the preceding Month, net of 
(a) any deductions to which Shipper is entitled in respect of flaring in 
accordance with Section 7.3, and (b) any other credits or deductions to 
which Shipper is entitled hereunder, including any MVC Shortfall Credit. 
Each Invoice shall also contain the volumes of all System Fuel and Losses 
allocated to Shipper with respect to each Subsystem in accordance with this 
Agreement. Gatherer shall include with each Invoice such information in its 
possession as is reasonably sufficient to explain and support both the 
amounts due and any adjustments to amounts previously invoiced.

Section 12.2    Payments. Unless otherwise agreed by the Parties, payments 
of amounts included in any Invoice delivered pursuant to this Agreement 
shall be due and payable, in accordance with each Invoices instructions, 
on or before the later of (a) the last Day of each Month and (b) the date 
that is ten Business Days after Shippers receipt of the applicable 
Invoice. All payments by Shipper under this Agreement shall be made by 
electronic funds transfer of immediately available funds to the account 
designated by Gatherer in the applicable Invoice. Any amounts not paid by 
the due date will be deemed delinquent and will accrue interest at the 
Interest Rate, such interest to be calculated from and including the due 
date but excluding the date the delinquent amount is paid in full. All 
Invoices shall be paid in full, but payment of any disputed amount shall 
not waive the payors right to dispute the Invoice in accordance with this 
Section 12.2. Shipper may, in good faith (i) dispute the correctness of any 
Invoice or any adjustment to an Invoice rendered under this Agreement or 
(ii) request an adjustment of any Invoice for any arithmetic or 
computational error, in each case, within 24 Months following the date on 
which the applicable Invoice (or adjustment thereto) was received by 
Shipper. Any dispute of an Invoice by Shipper or Invoice adjustment 
requested by Shipper shall be made in writing and shall state the basis for 
such dispute or adjustment. Upon resolution of the dispute, any required 
payment shall be made within ten Business Days of such resolution, along 
with interest accrued at the Interest Rate from and including the due date 
but excluding the date paid.

Section 12.3    Audit. Each Party has the right, at its sole expense and 
during normal working hours, to examine the records of the other Party to 
the extent reasonably necessary to verify the accuracy of any statement, 
charge or computation made pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement. 
The scope of such examination will be limited to the previous 24 Months 
calculated following the end of the Month in which such Notice of audit, 
statement, charge or computation was presented. No Party shall have the 
right to conduct more than one audit during any Year. If any such 
examination reveals any inaccuracy in any statement or charge, the 
necessary adjustments in such statement or charge and the payments 
necessitated thereby shall be made within ten Business Days of resolution 
of the inaccuracy. This Section 12.3 will survive any termination of the 
Agreement for the later of (a) a period of 24 Months from the end of the

REMEDIES

Section 13.1    Suspension of Performance; Release from Dedication.

(a)    If Shipper fails to pay pursuant to Section 12.2 any Invoice 
rendered pursuant to Section 12.1 and such failure is not remedied within 
five Business Days of written Notice of such failure to Shipper by 
Gatherer, Gatherer shall have the right to suspend performance under this 
Agreement until such amount, including interest at the Interest Rate, is 
paid in full.

(b)    In the event a Party fails to perform or comply with any material 
warranty, covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement (other than as 
provided in Section 13.1(a)), and such failure has not been remedied within 
30 Days after receipt of written Notice from the other Party of such 
failure, then the non-defaulting Party shall have the right to suspend its 
performance under this Agreement. If Shipper elects to suspend performance 
as the result of Gatherers uncured material default, then the Dedicated 
Production affected by such default shall be deemed to be temporarily 
released from the terms of this Agreement during the period of such 
suspension of performance.

Section 13.2    No Election. In the event of a default by a Party under 
this Agreement, the other Party shall be entitled in its sole discretion to 
pursue one or more of the remedies set forth in this Agreement, or such 
other remedy as may be available to it under this Agreement, at Law or in 
equity, subject, however, to the limitations set forth in Article 16. No 
election of remedies shall be required or implied as the result of a 
Partys decision to avail itself of any remedy under this Agreement.


ARTICLE 14
FORCE MAJEURE

Section 14.1    Events of Force Majeure. An event of Force Majeure means, 
an event that (a) is not within the reasonable control of the Party 
claiming suspension (the Claiming Party), (b) that prevents the Claiming 
Partys performance or fulfillment of any obligation of the Claiming Party 
under this Agreement (other than the payment of money), and (c) that by the 
exercise of due diligence the Claiming Party is unable to avoid or overcome 
in a reasonable manner. An event of Force Majeure includes, but is not 
restricted to: (i) acts of God; (ii) wars (declared or undeclared); (iii) 
insurrections, hostilities, riots, industrial disturbances, blockades or 
civil disturbances; (iv) epidemics, landslides, lightning, earthquakes, 
washouts, floods, fires, storms or storm warnings; (v) acts of a public 
enemy, acts of terror, or sabotage; (vi) explosions, breakage or accidents 
to machinery or lines of pipe; (vii) hydrate obstruction or blockages of 
any kind of lines of pipe; (viii) freezing of wells or delivery facilities, 
partial or entire failure of wells, and other events beyond the reasonable 
control of Shipper that affect the timing of

production or production levels; (ix) mining accidents, subsidence, 
cave-ins and fires; and (x) action or restraint by any Governmental 
Authority (so long as the Claiming Party has not applied for or assisted in 
the application for, and has opposed where and to the extent reasonable, 
such action or restraint). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, 
an event of Force Majeure specifically excludes the following occurrences 
or events: (A) the loss, interruption, or curtailment of interruptible 
transportation on any Downstream Facility necessary to take delivery of 
Shipper Gas (including any Drip Liquids allocated to Shipper in accordance 
with this Agreement) and/or Shipper Injected Liquids at any Delivery Point, 
unless and only to the extent the same event also curtails firm 
transportation at the same Delivery Point; (B) increases or decreases in 
Shipper Gas and/or Shipper Injected Liquids supply (other than any such 
increase or decrease caused by the actions described in subpart (x) above), 
allocation or reallocation of Shipper Gas and/or Shipper Injected Liquids 
production by the applicable well operators; (C) loss of markets; (D) loss 
of supply of equipment or materials; (E) failure of specific, individual 
wells or appurtenant facilities in the absence of an event of Force Majeure 
broadly affecting other wells in the same geographic area; and (F) price 
changes due to market conditions with respect to the purchase or sale of 
Gas and/or Injected Liquids gathered hereunder or the economics associated 
with the delivery, connection, receipt, gathering, compression, 
dehydration, treatment, processing or redelivery of such Gas and/or 
Injected Liquids.

Section 14.2    Actions. If either Gatherer or Shipper is rendered unable 
by an event of Force Majeure to carry out, in whole or part, its 
obligations under this Agreement and such Claiming Party gives Notice and 
reasonably full details of the event to the other Party as soon as 
practicable after the occurrence of the event, then, during the pendency of 
such Force Majeure, but only during that period, the obligations of the 
Claiming Party shall be canceled or suspended, as applicable, to the extent 
required; provided, however, that notwithstanding anything in the foregoing 
to the contrary, neither Party shall be relieved from any indemnification 
obligation or any obligation to make any payments hereunder as the result 
of Force Majeure, regardless which Party is affected. The Claiming Party 
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to remedy the Force Majeure 
condition with all reasonable dispatch, shall give Notice to the other 
Party of the termination of the Force Majeure, and shall resume performance 
of any suspended obligation promptly after termination of such Force 
Majeure. If the Claiming Party is Shipper and such Force Majeure is an 
event affecting a Delivery Point (but not all Delivery Points), such 
commercially reasonable efforts shall require, to the extent of capacity 
available to Shipper at the applicable Downstream Facilities, Shipper to 
nominate Shipper Gas and/or Shipper Injected Liquids for redelivery at 
those Delivery Points not affected by such Force Majeure. For the avoidance 
of doubt, if and to the extent Gatherer is delayed in completing any 
Committed Build-Outs by a Force Majeure event, then the Target Completion 
Date applicable thereto shall be extended for a period of time equal to 
that during which such obligations of Gatherer were delayed by such events.

Section 14.3    Strikes, Etc. The settlement of strikes or lockouts shall 
be entirely within the discretion of the Claiming Party, and any obligation 
hereunder to remedy a Force Majeure event shall not require the settlement 
of strikes or lockouts by acceding to the demands of the opposing Person(s) 
when such course is inadvisable in the sole discretion of the Claiming 
Party.

reasonable judgment, the financial and operational capability to perform 
and fulfill Shippers obligations hereunder. Gatherer shall be entitled to 
assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement (in whole or in

Gathering System so transferred to such Person.

SHIPPER GUARANTEE; ADEQUATE ASSURANCES

Section 18.1    Shipper Guarantee. Concurrently with the execution of the 
Original Agreement, Shipper delivered to Gatherer a guarantee from Hess 
Corporation, the indirect owner of 100% of the issued and outstanding 
shares of Shipper (Shipper Parent), which guarantee provides a guarantee 
of all of Shippers obligations under this Agreement.

Section 18.2    Adequate Assurances. If (a) Shipper fails to pay any 
Invoice according to the provisions hereof and such failure continues for a 
period of five Business Days after written Notice of such failure is 
provided to Shipper or (b) Gatherer has reasonable grounds for insecurity 
regarding the performance by Shipper of any obligation under this 
Agreement, then Gatherer, by delivery of written Notice to Shipper, may, 
singularly or in combination with any other rights it may have, demand 
Adequate Assurance by Shipper. As used herein, Adequate Assurance means, 
at the option of Shipper, (i) the advance payment in cash by Shipper to 
Gatherer for System Services to be provided under this Agreement in the 
following Month or (ii) delivery to Gatherer by Shipper of an Adequate 
Letter of Credit in an amount equal to not less than the aggregate amounts 
owed from Shipper to Gatherer hereunder for the prior two Month period. If

of Gatherers request therefor pursuant to this Section 18.2 or (B) Shipper

its sole option, terminate this Agreement upon written Notice to Shipper or

Shipper, in each case, without limiting any other rights or remedies 
available to Gatherer under this Agreement or otherwise. If Gatherer 
exercises the right to terminate this Agreement or suspend or reduce any 
System Services under this Section 18.2, then Shipper shall not be entitled 
to take, or cause to be taken, any action hereunder or otherwise against 
Gatherer for such termination, suspension or reduction. Failure of Gatherer 
to exercise its right to terminate this Agreement or suspend or reduce any 
System Service as provided in this Section 18.2 shall not constitute a 
waiver by Gatherer of any rights or remedies Gatherer may have under this 
Agreement, applicable Law, or otherwise.

(b)    Gas metered hereunder shall be computed in units of Mcf and Injected 
Liquids metered hereunder shall be computed in units of MCFE. Such Gas 
shall be measured in accordance with the MPMS Chapter 14.3, Part 3 August 
1992, Reaffirmed February 2009, and such Injected Liquids shall be measured 
in accordance with the MPMS, Chapter 5.3 November 2011, Measurement of 
Liquid Hydrocarbons by Turbine Meter or MPMS Chapter 5.6 October 202, 
Reaffirmed March 2008, Measurement of Liquid Hydrocarbons by Coriolis 
Meters, in each case, as the same may be amended from time to time, in a 
manner generally accepted by the gas producing industry, with the following 
exception: the atmospheric pressure used by Gatherer where Gas and Injected 
Liquids are measured shall be as set prescribed by the Standard Base 
Conditions.

(c)    Gatherer shall inspect (or cause to be inspected) said measurement 
devices semi-annually, and adjust and repair (or caused to be adjusted and 
repaired) the same as necessary. Gatherer shall notify Shipper in writing 
prior to such measurement device calibrations in order that Shipper may 
have a representative present to witness same, and the measurement 
device(s) shall be open to inspection at all times by Shipper in the 
presence of Gatherer. In case any question arises as to the accuracy of the 
measurement, said measurement devices shall be tested upon the demand of 
either Party. The expense of such tests shall be borne by the Party 
demanding same if the measurement device is found to be correct, and by 
Gatherer if found incorrect. A registration within one percent (1.0%) of 
correct shall be considered correct, but the measurement device shall be 
adjusted to zero error. Settlement for any period of inoperable or 
inaccurate measurement shall be in accordance with the average readings 
taken during the last preceding ten Days when the measurement device was 
registering accurately and the first ten Days after the measurement device 
was restored to accuracy. If Gatherer and Seller are unable to agree as to 
the time period during which the measurement device was inoperative or 
inaccurate it is agreed that volume adjustments shall be limited to no more 
than one-half of the operational Days from the date of the last calibration 
to the date of the correct calibration.

(d)    If the measurement equipment is found to be measuring inaccurately 
and the amount of Gas delivered cannot be ascertained or computed from the 
reading, then the Gas and Injected Liquids delivered will be estimated and 
agreed upon by the Parties based on the best data available, using the 
first available of the following:

(i)    The registration of any check meter or meters if installed and 
accurately registering;

(ii)    The correction of the errors, if the percentage of error is 
ascertainable by meter calibration, test, or mathematical calculation;

(iii)    The estimation based on comparison of the quantity of deliveries 
with deliveries during preceding periods under similar conditions when the 
meter was registering accurately.

(e)    If requested, Gatherer shall send the charts or electronic data, as 
available to Gatherer, to Shipper for checking, after which they are to be 
returned to Gatherer within 90 Days.

1.4    Gas Quality Determination.

(a)    All Gas and Injected Liquids tests conducted pursuant to this 
Agreement, whether by Gatherer or Shipper (or their respective 
representatives, shall be based on the applicable standards and 
specifications published in the American Gas Association (AGA) Committee 
Reports, the AGA Gas Measurement Manual, the MPMS, the Gas Processors 
Association (GSPA) Technical Standards, the GSPA Plant Operations Test 
Manual, and the American Society for Testing Materials Standards  Section 
5, in each case, as amended from time to time. Specifically, as related to 
(i) Gas sampling techniques, the Parties (or their respective 
representatives) shall utilize GSPA Standard 2166-86, and (ii) Injected 
Liquids sampling techniques, the Parties (or their respective 
representatives) shall utilize GSPA Standard 2174-93, in each case, as 
amended from time to time, for obtaining Receipt Point Gas and Injected 
Liquids samples hereunder.

(b)    Semi-annually, or as often as Gatherer deems advisable, Gatherer 
shall obtain a representative sample of Shipper Gas and Shipper Injected 
Liquids at each Receipt Point and, by a chromatographic gas analysis, 
determine the test content and Gross Heating Value of such Shipper Gas and 
Shipper Injected Liquids. The first such determination shall be made within 
a reasonable time after delivery of Gas and Injected Liquids into the 
Gathering System begins hereunder, with such time not to exceed 30 Days, 
and shall apply until the first Day of the Month following the next 
determination. The period for determination shall be selected by Gatherer. 
Gatherer shall notify Shipper in writing of the date of taking the test. 
Shipper may witness the tests or make joint tests with its own appliances 
at Shippers sole cost. The Gas and Injected Liquids used in the content 
tests shall be measured in Standard Cubic Feet. The specific gravity of the 
Gas and Injected Liquids tested shall be determined by any method adopted 
as standard by the GSPA. The percentage of hydrogen sulfide in the Gas and 
Injected Liquids shall be determined by the GSPA Length of Stain Tube 
Method, or any other generally accepted industry method should the Length 
of Stain Tube Method be changed. Use of a chromatographic gas analysis will 
provide the composition of the remaining components in the Gas and Injected 
Liquids stream.    For all Gas and Injected Liquids analyses contemplated 
hereunder, Gatherer shall have the right, but not the obligation, to change 
methods to meet recent industry standards; provided that such methods are 
deemed to be cost effective as determined by Gatherer in its sole business 
judgment.

1.5    Curtailment of Gas and Injected Liquids. If capacity on the 
Gathering System, or any Subsystem thereof, is interrupted, curtailed or 
reduced, or capacity is insufficient for the needs of all shippers desiring 
to use such capacity, the holders of Interruptible Service will be 
curtailed first, the holders of Firm Service shall be curtailed second, and 
the holders of Anchor Shipper Firm Service shall be curtailed last. As 
among the holders of each of Firm Service and Anchor Shipper Firm Service, 
the capacity available on each Subsystem to each such class of service 
under the preceding sentence shall be allocated among the holders of the 
applicable class of service on a pro rata basis, based on the percentage 
derived by dividing the Daily average volume of Gas and Injected Liquids 
actually Tendered by each holder of the applicable class of

service to Receipt Points on such Subsystem during the prior 90 Day period 
by the total volume of such Gas and Injected Liquids actually Tendered by 
all holders of the applicable class of service during such period to 
Receipt Points on such Subsystem. As among holders of Interruptible 
Service, the capacity available to such service, if any, shall be allocated 
pro rata among the holders of such service based on the percentage derived 
by dividing the Daily average volume of Gas and Injected Liquids actually 
Tendered by each holder of Interruptible Service to Receipt Points on such 
Subsystem during the prior 60 Day period by the total volume of such Gas 
and Injected Liquids actually Tendered by all holders of Interruptible 
Service to Receipt Points on such Subsystem during such period. During 
periods of curtailment on the Gathering System, the Parties shall meet to 
review alternative options for Shipper to optimize its overall volume 
throughput and related revenues in light of the specific constraints 
causing such curtailment on the Gathering System.

1.6    Allocations. Allocations required for determining payments or Fees 
due under this Agreement shall be made by Gatherer. This Section 1.6 of the 
Operating Terms shall be based upon the measurements taken and quantities 
determined for the applicable Month.

(a)    The following definitions shall be applicable: Fuel Point means a 
point on the Gathering System where Gathering System Fuel is measured, 
sampled, calculated or consumed.

(b)    Gathering System Fuel shall be allocated to each Receipt Point 
upstream of the applicable Fuel Point by multiplying (i) the Gathering 
System Fuel, stated in Mcfs, measured at the applicable Fuel Point during 
the applicable Month by (ii) a fraction, (A) the numerator of which is the 
volume of Gas, stated in Mcfs, received into the Gathering System at such 
Receipt Point during such Month, and (B) the denominator of which is the 
aggregate volume of Gas, stated in Mcfs, received into the Gathering System 
at all Receipt Points upstream of the applicable Fuel Point during such 
Month.

(c)    The Gathering System L&U in any Month shall be determined by 
subtracting (i) the sum of (A) the Thermal Content of all volumes of Gas 
(including any Drip Liquids allocated to Shipper in accordance with this 
Agreement) and Injected Liquids actually delivered to the Delivery Points 
on the Gathering System during such Month, and (B) the Thermal Content of 
all volumes of Gas consumed as Gathering System Fuel measured at all Fuel 
Points on the Gathering System during such Month, from (ii) the Thermal 
Content of all volumes of all Gas and Injected Liquids received into the 
Gathering System at all Receipt Points.

(d)    Drip Liquids recovered at the Drip Points by Gatherer shall be 
allocated to Shipper as follows, in each case, on a Subsystem-by-Subsystem 
basis: Shipper shall be allocated that portion of the Drip Liquids 
recovered at the Drip Points on a Subsystem equal to the proportion that 
(i) the Thermal Content of the aggregate volumes of Shipper Gas Tendered by 
Shipper at the Receipt Points on such Subsystem and received by Gatherer 
into the Gathering System during such Month, bears to (ii) the Thermal 
Content of the aggregate volumes of all Gas (including Non-Party Gas and 
Shipper Gas) tendered by a shipper (whether Shipper or a Non-Party) at the 
Receipt Points on such Subsystem and received by Gatherer into the 
Gathering System during such Month.

FEE RECALCULATION MODEL


Original Methodology
 
  	 	  	The production profile used will be based on the Current 
Development Plan. To the extent appropriate, the production profile is 
adjusted by an operating factor of **% to reflect realistic operations. 
Further, the Current Development Plan will be adjusted to reflect major 
maintenance and turnarounds.
 
  	 	  	Initial capital (opening balance) is based upon net book value as 
of December 31, 2013.
 
  	 	  	Committed Build-Out Costs and Maintenance Capital Estimates are 
based on the Current Gathering System Plan.
 
  	 	  	Operating Expense Estimates are derived from the Current Gathering 
System Plan.
 
  	 	  	Includes projected public company and executive management costs 
allocated on a pro rata basis to the assets.
 
  	 	  	Includes major maintenance and turnaround expenses
 
  	 	  	Residual Value equals (a) the sum of initial capital and 
Committed Build-Out Costs over the Initial Term (10 years), multiplied by 
(b) (i) one, minus (ii) (A) the ratio of cumulative throughput from the 
Current Development Plan in the Initial Term (10 years), divided by (B) the 
cumulative throughput from the Current Development Plan over the full plan 
period (20 years).
 
  	 	  	The Return on Capital (unadjusted), using a mid-year convention, 
was utilized.
 
  	 	  	Fees are expressed as an escalating $/Mcf or $/Barrel, as 
applicable, figure required to achieve the Return on Capital.
 
  	 	  	Fees are escalated based on the average annual percentage change 
in the CPI for the 10 years prior to each Recalculation Election date and 
will be expressed on an annual basis in forward years.
 
  	 	  	Market-based Fees not subject to target return calculation but 
subject to CPI escalation:
 
  	 	  	Compression Fees
 
  	 	  	If applicable, pass-through costs (power and utilities, other) and 
market-based revenue streams (compression fees, short-haul/injection fees, 
other) are set to offset costs to be recovered.

Redetermination Methodology

Each year, if a Recalculation Election is made pursuant to Section 7.1(e), 
the Fees will be recalculated to reflect:
 
  	 	  	The enumerated items in Section 7.1(e)(i) through (ix).
 
  	 	  	The present value of prior year(s) revenue and throughput will be 
subtracted from the Required Cost Recovery and Escalating Tariff 
Throughput (as each such term is used in the following example 
calculations) calculations so that the new Fees reflect costs to be 
recovered over the remaining Term coupled with expected throughput.
 
  	 	  	Operating Expense Estimates based upon the latest updated 
Gathering System Plan for the applicable year and subsequent years. Prior 
year(s) operating expenses will not be trued-up to actuals.
 
  	 	  	Projected public company and executive management costs allocated 
on a pro rata basis to the assets.
 
  	 	  	Major maintenance and turnaround expenses not otherwise included 
in the above listed items.
 
  	 	  	Any scheduled downtime of the Gathering System.
 
  	 	  	Adjusted Residual Value based on latest Updated Development Plan.
 
  	 	  	All other assumptions will be the same as the Original Methodology 
set forth above.

SECONDARY TERM FEE

Effective as of the first Year of the Secondary Term, each Fee hereunder 
shall be calculated in the following manner:

1.    For the first Year of the Secondary Term, each Fee shall be an amount 
equal to the simple average of: (a) an amount equal to (i) the amount of 
such Fee for the eighth Year of the Initial Term, increased by (ii) the 
percentage change in the CPI from the eighth Year of the Initial Term to 
the first Year of the Secondary Term, (b) an amount equal to (i) the amount 
of such Fee for the ninth Year of the Initial Term, increased by (ii) the 
percentage change in the CPI from the ninth Year of the Initial Term to the 
first Year of the Secondary Term, and (c) an amount equal to (i) the amount 
of such Fee for the tenth Year of the Initial Term, increased by (ii) the 
percentage change in the CPI from the tenth Year of the Initial Term to the 
first Year of the Secondary Term.

2.    For each Year during the Term following the first Year of the 
Secondary Term, each Fee shall be an amount equal to: (a) the amount of 
such Fee for the immediately preceding Year (as calculated pursuant to 
Section 7.1(i)), increased by (b) the percentage change in the CPI from the 
then-immediately preceding Year to such current Year.

3.    For purposes of determining any Fee pursuant to this Exhibit G-3 
during the Secondary Term and thereafter (a) no increase to any Fee 
resulting from any application of the CPI adjustment described above in 
subpart (2)(b) shall exceed 3.0% for any given Year, and (b) no Fee shall 
ever be decreased as a result of any application of the CPI adjustment 
described above in subpart (2)(b) to an amount less than the amount of such 
Fee as calculated pursuant to Section 7.1(i) for the prior Year.
