Dear Ben

With reference to Clause 3.2 of the service contract between British 
American Tobacco p.l.c. (the Company) and you dated 26 March 2008 (the 
Service Contract), I write to confirm formally an expansion of your 
duties as Finance Director to include the additional responsibilities of 
Chief Information Officer. This change will take effect from 1 September 
2010.

In order to recognise this broadening of your roles accountability and the 
scope of the significant additional responsibilities, I am pleased to 
inform you that your base salary will increase to £720,000 per annum with 
effect from 1 September 2010 (the New Base Salary). All the other 
existing terms and conditions of the Service Contract remain unchanged.

For the avoidance of doubt, I confirm that the New Base Salary will be used 
as the basis for any 2010 IEIS award and any 2011 LTIP grant.

I shall be grateful if you will please confirm this variation of the 
Service Contract by signing the attached duplicate copy of this letter and 
returning it to me in due course. This letter will be retained by the 
Company and will be appended to the Service Contract, both documents being 
subject to the public disclosure requirements from time to time.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your hard work and 
contribution so far, as we look forward to building on the continued 
success of the Company over the coming months ahead.


Yours sincerely
For and on behalf of British American Tobacco p.l.c.

/s/ Richard Burrows

Richard Burrows
Chairman

I acknowledge receipt of this letter and accept the terms as detailed 
above.
 
Signed: 	   	/s/ Ben Stevens 	   	Dated: 	   	9.1.10
