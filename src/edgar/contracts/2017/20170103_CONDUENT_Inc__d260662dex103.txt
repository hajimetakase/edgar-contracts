included in the applicable one-time contribution, and in the event the 
applicable excess amount described in the immediately preceding sentence is

, that from and after the Distribution

(i) the number of shares of Conduent Common Stock subject to each such 
Conduent RSU shall be equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the
 
28

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Specified Performance Factor, by (B) the Conduent Equity Award Conversion 
Ratio, with any fractional share rounded to the nearest whole share; and

(ii) such Conduent RSUs shall be subject to the same time-based vesting 
conditions as applicable to the corresponding Xerox Performance Shares as

any performance-based vesting conditions (other than to the extent taken 
into account in calculating the applicable Specified Performance Factor).

SECTION 9.03. Employer Tax Obligations; Tax Deductions. Xerox and Conduent 
hereby acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding any provision of this 
Article IX to the contrary, the members of the Conduent Group shall be 
solely responsible for all obligations relating to reporting of Taxes to 
the appropriate Tax Authority and withholding and remitting the amounts of 
any such Taxes required to be withheld (including any Employment Taxes) to 
the appropriate Tax Authority in connection with any Conduent Options and 
Conduent RSUs, and Xerox shall not have any responsibility or Liability 
with respect thereto. The rights and obligations of the Parties with 
respect to Tax deductions relating to the Equity Awards shall be governed 
by Section 10.03.

SECTION 9.04. Compliance with Applicable Law. The Parties shall take such 
additional or alternative actions as are deemed necessary or advisable by 
Xerox in its sole discretion in order to effectuate the foregoing 
provisions of this Article IX in compliance with securities Laws and other 
legal requirements associated with equity compensation awards or in order 
to avoid adverse legal, accounting or tax consequences for the members of 
the Xerox Group, the members of the Conduent Group or any award holders.

SECTION 9.05. Equity Award Administration. Without limiting the generality 
of Section 10.01, following the date of this Agreement, the Parties shall, 
and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to share such information as 
is necessary to (a) administer equity awards pursuant to this Article IX , 
(b) provide any required information to holders of such equity awards and 
(c) timely make any governmental filings with respect thereto. Such 
information shall be made available to the other Party within 10 business 
days following such Partys request for the applicable information; 
provided however, if such information (including the Specified Performance 
Factor) is needed for purposes of timely making any governmental filing, 
such information shall be provided no later than one business day prior to 
the deadline for making such filing.


ARTICLE X

Cooperation; Production of Witnesses; Compensation Deductions

SECTION 10.01. Cooperation. Following the date of this Agreement, the 
Parties shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, use 
reasonable best efforts
 
29

------------------------------------------------------------------------
to cooperate with respect to any employee compensation or benefits matters 
that either Party reasonably determines require the cooperation of the 
other Party in order to accomplish the objectives of this Agreement, 
including by exchanging any necessary participant records and engaging 
recordkeepers, providers, insurers and other third parties. Without 
limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, (a) Xerox and Conduent 
shall cooperate in connection with any audits of any Benefit Plan with 
respect to which such Party may have Information and (b) Xerox and Conduent 
shall cooperate in connection with any audits of their respective payroll 
services (whether by a Governmental Authority in the U.S. or otherwise) in 
connection with the services provided by one Party to the other Party. With 
respect to each Benefit Plan, the obligations of the members of the Xerox 
Group and the members of the Conduent Group to cooperate pursuant to this 
Section 10.01 or any other provision of this Agreement shall remain in 
effect until the later of (i) the date all audits of such Benefit Plan with 
respect to which a Party may have Information have been completed, (ii) the 
date the applicable statute of limitations with respect to such audits has 
expired and (iii) the date each Party discharges all obligations to the 
other Partys employees and former employees and their respective 
beneficiaries and dependents under its Benefit Plans.

SECTION 10.02. Production of Witnesses; Records. Without limiting the 
foregoing, Section 7.07 of the Separation Agreement is hereby incorporated 
into this Agreement mutatis mutandis.

SECTION 10.03. Compensation Deductions. Any U.S. Federal, state and local 
income Tax deduction arising as a result of (i) the exercise, vesting or 
settlement of any Conduent Options or Conduent RSUs and (ii) the payment of 
annual bonuses pursuant to Section 3.01 shall, in each case, be claimed (if 
and when permitted by applicable Law) by the Party (or one of its 
Subsidiaries) that employs the individual with respect to whom such 
compensation deduction arises at the time that it arises or, if such 
individual is not then employed by any Party or a Subsidiary of a Party, by 
the Party that most recently employed such individual; provided that the 
Parties shall reasonably cooperate so that the Tax Benefit of any 
deductions claimed by a member of the Conduent Group shall be transferred 
to a member of the Xerox Group in the case of the Xerox Reimbursement 
Bonuses and Conduent HSA Premium Payments, and the Tax Benefit of any 
deductions claimed by a member of the Xerox Group shall be transferred to a 
member of the Conduent Group in the case of the Conduent Reimbursement 
Bonuses and Xerox HSA Premium Payments. If a deduction claimed by a Party 
(the Employing Party) pursuant to the preceding sentence is disallowed 
pursuant to a Final Determination and is not able to be claimed by the 
Employing Party in any other taxable period, the other Party (or one of its 
Subsidiaries) will amend its applicable Tax Return to claim such deduction 
to the extent it is more likely than not deductible by such other Party and 
such other Party shall pay to the Employing Party an amount equal to the 
Tax Benefit received by the other Party (or one of its Subsidiaries) as a 
result of such deduction (determined by multiplying the total amount of the 
deduction by such other Partys tax rate used for financial accounting 
purposes for the applicable tax period (the Tax Rate)). To the extent the 
other Partys deduction is subsequently disallowed pursuant to a Final 
Determination, the Employing Party shall pay to the other Party an amount 
equal to the lesser of (i) the amount previously paid by the other Party to 
the
 
30

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Employing Party pursuant to this Section 10.03 and (ii) the amount of the 
deduction that was disallowed multiplied by the Tax Rate. Any amount 
required to be transferred by a Party in respect of any Tax Benefit 
pursuant to this Section 10.03 shall be reduced for any Taxes and 
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such Party in connection with 
the receipt of such Tax Benefit.

ARTICLE XI

Termination

Group under this Agreement.

Agreement and (c) no provision of this Agreement shall create such rights 
in any such persons in respect of any benefits that may be provided, 
directly or indirectly, under any Xerox Benefit Plan or any Conduent 
Benefit Plan. Furthermore, no provision of this Agreement shall constitute 
a limitation on the rights to amend, modify or terminate any Xerox Benefit 
Plan or any Conduent Benefit Plan and nothing herein shall be construed as 
an amendment to any such Benefit Plan. No provision of this Agreement shall 
require any member of the Xerox Group or any member of the Conduent Group 
to continue the employment of any employee or the services of any Service 
Provider of any member of either Group for any specific period of time 
following the Distribution.

SECTION 14.10. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement or the 
application thereof to any Person or circumstance is determined by a court 
of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the 
remaining provisions hereof, or the application of such provision to 
Persons or circumstances or in jurisdictions other than those as to which 
it has been held invalid or unenforceable, shall remain in full force and 
effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated thereby, so 
long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated 
hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to either Party. 
Upon any such determination, any such provision, to the extent determined 
to be invalid, void or unenforceable, shall be deemed replaced by a 
provision that such court determines is valid and enforceable and that 
comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid, void or 
unenforceable provision.

SECTION 14.11. Headings. The article, section and paragraph headings 
contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not 
affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

SECTION 14.12. Survival of Covenants. Except as expressly set forth in this 
Agreement, the covenants in this Agreement and the Liabilities for the

shall remain in full force and effect.

SECTION 14.13. Waivers of Default. No failure or delay of any Party (or the 
applicable member of its Group) in exercising any right or remedy under 
this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or 
partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or 
discontinuance of steps to enforce such right or power, or any course of 
conduct, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of 
any other right or power. Waiver by any Party of any default by the other 
Party of any provision of this Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver by 
the waiving Party of any subsequent or other default.

SECTION 14.14. Specific Performance. In the event of any actual or 
threatened default in, or breach of, any of the terms, conditions and 
provisions of this Agreement, the affected Party shall have the right to 
specific performance and injunctive or other equitable relief of its rights 
under this Agreement, in addition to any and all other rights and remedies 
at Law or in equity, and all such rights and remedies shall be cumulative. 
The other Party shall not oppose the granting of such relief on the basis 
that money damages are an adequate remedy. The Parties agree that the 
remedies at Law for
 
34

------------------------------------------------------------------------
any breach or threatened breach hereof, including monetary damages, are 
inadequate compensation for any loss and that any defense in any action for 
specific performance that a remedy at Law would be adequate is waived. Any 
requirements for the securing or posting of any bond with such remedy are 
waived.

SECTION 14.15. Amendments. No provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed 
waived, amended, supplemented or modified by any Party, unless such waiver, 
amendment, supplement or modification is in writing and signed by the 
authorized representative of each Party.

SECTION 14.16. Interpretation. Words in the singular shall be held to 
include the plural and vice versa and words of one gender shall be held to 
include the other gender as the context requires. The terms hereof, 
herein, herewith and words of similar import, unless otherwise stated, 
shall be construed to refer to this Agreement as a whole (including all of 
the schedules hereto) and not to any particular provision of this 
Agreement. Article, Section or Schedule references are to the articles, 
sections and schedules of or to this Agreement unless otherwise specified.
