STATEMENT OF WORK (Phase I)
 
TITLE: 	Cell-Based Models for Prostate Cancer Health Disparity Research
PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: 	Dr. Johng Rhim
PROJECT DURATION: 	9 months
COMPANY: 	Shuttle Pharmaceuticals, LLC
SUBCONTRACTORS: 	Georgetown University
 
I. 	Background Information and Objectives
A. 	Background Information
Prostate cancer health disparities studies have shown that African-American 
(AA) men are at higher risk for developing prostate cancer, as well as at 
higher risk of cancer specific death rates, as compared to Caucasian 
American (CA) men. The causes of disparities have been attributed to 
socioeconomic differences, environmental exposures and biological factors. 
Most disparities studies have been population based, in part, due to the 
lack of relevant in vitro and in vivo models to support biological studies. 
In this Phase I proposal, we will develop an annotated AA prostate 
epithelial cancer cell line with donor matched normal prostate epithelial 
cells and bio-banked reference prostate tissues. To support the feasibility 
of establishing 50 prostate cancer cell lines from AA men in a subsequent 
Phase II application, we will prepare written protocols for tissue 
collection, processing, establishment of conditionally reprogrammed cells 
and the reagents necessary for performing studies with these cells. We will 
determine commercial feasibility for cell distribution and reagent 
marketing through a private-public partnership.
 
B. 	Technical Objectives
The three technical objectives of this proposal focus on determining the 
feasibility for establishing paired cancer and normal epithelial cell lines 
from African-American patients presenting with prostate cancers. In the 
first objective, three previously harvested, de-identified and bio-banked 
prostate cells from AA patients will be grown and characterized to develop 
standard operating protocols and optimal media conditions. The second 
objective will be to optimize growth medium for use with AA cell lines. The 
third objective is to negotiate intellectual property (license) through 
Georgetown University to support commercialization of AA cell lines.
 
Objective 1. Grow paired cancer and normal epithelial cells from AA 
prostate tumors and normal biopsy specimens bio-banked on IRB protocol # 
2012-163.
 
Task 1.1. Establish malignant and non-malignant cell lines from AA 
prostatectomy specimens.
Milestone 1.1. Expand and freeze 20 vials for each AA cell line to perform 
characterizations.
 
Task 1.2. Characterize and annotate AA cells.
Milestone 1.2. Full characterization of AA cell lines, including: cell 
origin, cell growth > 30 passages, capacity to form xenograft tumors, 
karyotypes, expression of prostate tissue and tumor specific markers, STR 
authentication and Mycoplasma testing
 
Task 1.3. Expand early passages of CRCs for freezing and banking in the CRC 
bio-repository.
Milestone 1.3. 50 vials of 1 -2x10^6 cells/vial are banked for each 
normal/tumor AA cell pair.
 
Task 1.4. Prepare written protocols and standard operating procedures 
(SOPs) for establishing AA cell lines.
Milestone 1.4. SOPs for establishing AA cell lines and SOPs for cell growth 
and annotation.
 
Objective 2. Determine the optimal growth medium and conditions for growing 
prostate CRCs with and without irradiated feeder cells.
 
Task 2.1. Collect and concentrate the conditioned medium from J2-irradiated 
fibroblasts in sufficient quantity to support AA cell growth in 50 flasks. 
Test effects of graded concentrations of conditioned medium on AA cells 
using telomerase and cell growth assays.
 
Milestone 2.1.1. Documentation of effects of conditioned medium on AA cell 
growth.
Milestone 2.1.2. Optimal formulation of conditioned medium supplement for 
AA prostate cell growth.
 
Task 2.2. Optimize the panel of supplementary growth factors for AA 
prostate CRC cell growth.
Milestone 2.2. Proprietary formula of growth factors needed to promote AA 
CRC culture growth.

Statement of Work (Phase I) Dated 09/19/2016
Contract No. HHSN261201600038C

 
Task 2.3. Compare cell characteristics under different media and growth 
conditions.
Milestone 2.3. Determine cell growth over at least 30 passages, capacity to 
form xenograft tumors, karyotype at early and late passages and expression 
of prostate specific markers.
 
Objective 3. Negotiate a licensing agreement for commercialization of AA 
derived cells, submit a Phase I final report to SBIR administration and 
prepare a Phase II SBIR application.
 
Task 3.1. Through the GU Office of Technology Commercialization, negotiate 
to obtain a licensing agreement to support commercialization of established 
AA cells.
Milestone 3.1. Executed licensing agreement.
 
Task 3.2. Submit a written final Phase I report to SBIR administration.
Milestone 3.2. Phase I milestones have been reached and SBIR administration 
is informed of the technical and commercial feasibility of establishing 50 
model AA cell lines supporting a Phase II application in response to an 
appropriate NIH/SBIR RFA.

Invoice Submission Instructions in Section G of the Contract Schedule.
 
Frequency: Submit payment requests upon delivery and acceptance of goods or 
services unless otherwise authorized by the Contracting Officer.
 
Currency: All NIH contracts are expressed in United States dollars. When 
the Government pays in a currency other than United States dollars, 
billings shall be expressed, and payment by the Government shall be made, 
in that other currency at amounts coincident with actual costs incurred. 
Currency fluctuations may not be a basis of gain or loss to the Contractor. 
Notwithstanding the above, the total of all invoices paid under this 
contract may not exceed the United States dollars authorized.
 
Preparation and Itemization of the Payment Request: Prepare payment 
requests as follows:
 
Note: 	All information must be legible or the invoice will be considered 
improper and returned to the Contractor.
 
(a) 	Designated Billing Office Name and Address: Enter the designated 
billing office name and address, as identified in the Invoice Submission 
Instructions in Section G of the Contract Schedule.
 
(b) 	Contractor's Name, Address, Point of Contact, TIN, and DUNS or DUNS+4 
Number: Show the Contractor's name and address exactly as they appear in 
the contract. Any invoice identified as improper will be sent to this 
address. Also include the name, title, phone number, and e-mail address of 
the Point of Contact in case of questions. If the remittance name differs 
from the legal business name, both names must appear on the invoice. 
Provide the Contractor's Federal Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) and 
Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) or DUNS+4 number. The DUNS number 
must identify the Contractor's name and address exactly as stated in the 
contract, and as registered in the System for Acquisition Management (SAM)

  the Contractor (i.e., name, address, point of contact, TIN, and DUNS
  number), with the remittance information clearly identified as such.
 
(c) 	Invoice/Voucher Number: Identify each payment request by a unique 
invoice number, which can only be used one time regardless of the number of 
contracts or orders held by an organization. For example, if a contractor 
has already submitted invoice number 05 on one of its contracts or orders, 
it cannot use that same invoice number on any other contract or order. 
Payment requests with duplicate invoice numbers will be considered improper 
and returned to the contractor.
 

  	1 	ATTACHMENT 2

 

 
  The NIH does not prescribe a particular numbering format but suggests
  using a job or account number for each contract and order followed by a
  sequential invoice number (example: 8675309-05). Invoice numbers are
  limited to 30 characters. There are no restrictions on the use of special
  characters, such as colons, dashes, forward slashes, or parentheses.
 
  If all or part of an invoice is suspended and the contractor chooses to
  reclaim those costs on a supplemental invoice, the contractor may use the
  same unique invoice number followed by an alpha character, such as "R"
  for revised (example: 8675309-05R).
 
(d) 	Date Invoice/Voucher Prepared: Insert the date the payment request is 
prepared.
 
(e) 	Contract Number and Order Number (if applicable): Insert the contract 
number and order number (as applicable).

a two-way or three-way match. To determine required payment method, refer 
to the Invoice Submission Instructions in Section G of the Contract 
Schedule.
 
(j) 	Office of Acquisitions: Insert the name of the Office of Acquisitions, 
as identified in the Invoice Submission Instructions in Section G of the 
Contract Schedule.
 
(k) 	Central Point of Distribution: Identify the Central Point of 
Distribution, as specified in the Invoice Submission Instructions in 
Section G of the Contract Schedule.
 
(l) 	Billing Period: Insert the beginning and ending dates (month, day, and 
year) of the period in which costs were incurred and for which 
reimbursement is claimed.
 
(m) 	Description of Supplies or Services: Provide a description of the 
supplies or services, by line item (if applicable), quantity, unit price 
(where appropriate), and total amount. The item description, unit of 
measure, and unit price must match those specified in the contract. For 
example, if the contract specifies 1 box of hypodermic needles (100/box) 
with a unit price of $50.00, then the invoice must state 1 box, hypodermic 
needles (100/box), $50.00, not 100 syringes at $0.50 each. Invoices that do 
not match the line item pricing in the contract will be considered improper 
and will be returned to the Contractor.

documentation in order to assist in the verification of any of the 
information provided.
 
Even if correct information has been included in other materials submitted
