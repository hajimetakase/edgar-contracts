Section 2.2    Term. Subject to earlier termination pursuant to Section 
10.1, (a) this Agreement shall commence at the Effective Time and shall 
remain in effect (i) with respect to the Crude Oil Services provided 
hereunder, until the 10th anniversary of the Effective Time (the Â“Crude Oil 
Services Initial TermÂ”), and Provider shall have the option, exercisable by 
the delivery of written Notice to Customer on or before the date that is 
three Years prior to the expiration of the Crude Oil Services Initial Term, 
to renew this Agreement, insofar as it relates to the Crude Oil Services, 
for one additional ten Year period (such second ten Year period, the Â“
Crude Oil Services Secondary TermÂ”) and (ii) with respect to the NGL 
Services provided hereunder, until the 10th anniversary of the Effective 
Time (the Â“NGL Services Initial TermÂ”), and Provider shall have the option, 
exercisable by the delivery of written Notice to Customer on or before the 
date that is three Years prior to the expiration of the NGL Services

Services Initial Term, the Crude Oil Services Secondary Term, the NGL 
Services Initial Term, the NGL Services Secondary Term, and any subsequent 
Yearly renewal periods, collectively, the Â“TermÂ”). Should Provider elect to 
renew this Agreement for the NGL Services Secondary Term pursuant to this 
Section 2.2, then, upon the beginning of the NGL Services Secondary Term 
(and thereafter, during the Term of this Agreement, insofar as it relates 
to the NGL Services), the provisions of Section 7.1(h) and Exhibit G-3 
shall be applicable hereunder. For the avoidance of doubt, during the NGL

DEDICATION OF PRODUCTION; PASS-THROUGH CONTRACTS


Section 4.1    Dedication.

(a)    Subject to the provisions of Section 4.1 through Section 4.4 and 
Article 17, Customer exclusively dedicates and commits to deliver to 
Provider at either a North Zone Receipt Point or a South Zone Receipt Point 
under this Agreement for the provision of all or a portion of the Crude Oil 
Services (to the extent Crude Oil Services beyond the initial Receipt Point 
are not required by Customer) all:

(i)    Customer Crude Oil formerly owned or Controlled by Producer and 
produced from those oil and gas properties located in the area described on 
Exhibit B-1 (such area, as the same may be modified from time to time by 
the Parties hereunder, the Â“Dedicated AreaÂ”) that are operated by Producer, 
or that are not operated by Producer but from which Producer has elected to 
take its applicable production in-kind (such Crude Oil, Â“Dedicated Producer 
Crude OilÂ”); and

(ii)    Customer Crude Oil that Customer owns or Controls through one of 
the contracts described on Exhibit B-2, which Exhibit shall be updated at 
least annually by the Parties as part of the Development Plan and Terminals 
System Plan processes pursuant to Article 5 (such contracts, the Â“
Dedicated ContractsÂ”). Pending any formal amendment of Exhibit B-2 to 
update the list of Dedicated Contracts contained thereon, the Parties 
acknowledge and agree that CustomerÂ’s delivery of Notice to Provider 
pursuant to Section 19.2 indicating CustomerÂ’s intent to dedicate a 
contract to Provider under this Agreement as a Â“Dedicated ContractÂ” shall 
be sufficient to classify (A) such contract as a Â“Dedicated ContractÂ” for 
all purposes hereunder until Exhibit B-2 is formally amended to include the 
same, and (B) all volumes owned or Controlled by Customer pursuant to such 
contract and delivered to Provider hereunder (to the extent such volumes 
were delivered from and after the last update of Exhibit B-2 and prior to 
the delivery of such written notice or after the delivery of such notice) 
as Â“Dedicated Crude OilÂ” for all purposes hereunder.

(b)    All Dedicated Producer Crude Oil and all Customer Crude Oil subject 
to a Dedicated Contract that (i) is not described in Section 4.1(c)(i), 
(ii) is not subject to a Conflicting Dedication, (iii) has not been 
released (either temporarily or permanently) from dedication pursuant to 
Section 4.3, and (iv) has not been reserved and utilized by Customer 
pursuant to Section 4.4, is referred to collectively hereunder as Â“
Dedicated Crude OilÂ”.


(c)    Notwithstanding the foregoing:

(i)    any Dedicated Producer Crude Oil that is produced from a well that 
was drilled and completed, and is operated, in each case, by a Non-Party 
that is not an Affiliate of Customer, shall not be considered Â“Dedicated 
Crude OilÂ” hereunder;

(ii)    no Dedicated Contract may be amended, modified or otherwise 
supplemented by Customer such that the volume of Dedicated Crude Oil 
resulting therefrom would be materially reduced without the prior written 
consent of Provider, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld; 
provided, however, that such restrictions shall not apply to (A) any 
termination or expiration of any such Dedicated Contract pursuant to its 
terms, or (B) the removal of any individual Well from the coverage of any 
such Dedicated Contract that, on average, produced less than 100 Barrels of 
Crude Oil a Month; and

(iii)    Customer shall have the option to utilize Tank Car (Crude Oil) 
Services or transport Dedicated Crude Oil from the Rail Loading Points 
using third party Tank Cars.

SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, AND THE TERMS HAVE 
BEEN MARKED AT THE APPROPRIATE PLACE WITH TWO ASTERISKS (**).
 
Section 4.2    Conflicting Dedications. Notwithstanding anything in this 
Agreement to the contrary, Customer shall have the right to comply with 
each transportation agreement, terminal agreement, storage agreement, rail 
service agreement or any commitment or arrangement (including any volume 
commitment) that would require any Customer Crude Oil to utilize a terminal 
facility, pipeline system, storage facility or other similar systems or 
facilities other than the Terminals System (each, a Â“Conflicting Dedication
Â”) that (a) is in effect as of January 1, 2017 and is described in Exhibit 
C, or (b) is applicable and in effect as of the date that Customer acquires 
Control of any Crude Oil that would qualify as Dedicated Crude Oil that was 
not under the Control of Customer as of January 1, 2017. Notwithstanding 
the foregoing, Customer shall have only the right to comply with the 
applicable Conflicting Dedication up to and until the first Day of the 
Month following the termination of such Conflicting Dedication (without 
giving effect to any right of Customer to renew or extend the term of such 
Conflicting Dedication). For the avoidance of doubt, any Customer Crude Oil 
that, but for a Conflicting Dedication, would be considered Â“Dedicated 
Crude OilÂ” hereunder, shall, automatically upon the termination of the 
applicable Conflicting Dedication, be considered Â“Dedicated Crude OilÂ” 
hereunder. As of January 1, 2017, Customer represents that, except as set 
forth in Exhibit C, the Dedicated Crude Oil is not subject to any 
Conflicting Dedication.


Section 4.3    Releases from Dedication.

(a)    If Provider has failed to complete the facilities necessary to 
connect a Planned Receipt Point to the Terminals System within 270 Days of 
the applicable Target Completion Date contained in the then-currently 
agreed Terminals System Plan, then, upon written Notice from Customer to 
Provider, the volumes of Dedicated Crude Oil applicable to such Planned 
Receipt Point shall be permanently released from the dedication under this 
Agreement and Customer may deliver and commit such Customer Crude Oil that 
was formerly Dedicated Crude Oil to such other terminal facility, pipeline 
system, storage facility, rail cars or other similar system or facilities 
as it shall determine in its sole discretion.

(b)    Certain Dedicated Crude Oil may also be temporarily released from 
dedication under this Agreement in the event of:

(i)    (A) Provider failing to complete the facilities necessary to connect 
a Planned Receipt Point to the Terminals System by the applicable Target 
Completion Date contained in the then-currently agreed Terminals System 
Plan, and (B) such failure causing there to be insufficient capacity on the 
Terminals System to accommodate the volumes of Dedicated Crude Oil and 
Customer NGLs contained in the applicable System Production Estimates 
applicable to such time;

(ii)    any curtailment or interruption of the System Services to be 
provided to Customer as set forth in Section 8.5(d) or in Section 1.5 of 
the Operating Terms;

(iii)    a material breach of this Agreement by Provider as provided in 
Section 13.1(b); or

(iv)    an order of a Governmental Authority causing the curtailment of 
System Services to Customer as provided in Section 8.2.

Section 4.4    CustomerÂ’s Reservations. Customer reserves the following 
rights respecting Dedicated Producer Crude Oil and all Customer Crude Oil 
subject to a Dedicated Contract for itself: to deliver or furnish to 
applicable operators such Customer Crude Oil as a reasonable and prudent 
operator would deem appropriate or necessary for production operations.

Section 4.5    Pass-Through Contracts. The Pass-Through Contracts existing 
on January 1, 2017 are set forth on Exhibit B-3 attached hereto. Customer 
shall have the right from time to time during the Term to propose 
additional Pass-Through Contracts under this Agreement by delivery of 
Notice to Provider pursuant to Section 19.2 indicating CustomerÂ’s intent to 
add a Pass-Through Contract to Exhibit B-3. Should (a) Provider consent to 
the addition of such contract as a Pass-Through Contract hereunder and (b) 
Exhibit B-3 be updated to reflect the addition of such Pass-Through 
Contract, then all volumes owned or Controlled by Customer pursuant to such 
contract and delivered to Provider hereunder (to the extent such volumes 
were delivered from and after the last update of Exhibit B-3 and prior to 
the delivery of such written notice or after the delivery of such notice) 
shall be deemed to be Â“Pass-Through Contract Crude OilÂ” for all purposes 
hereunder. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary and 
for the avoidance of doubt, the Parties agree that any Exhibit update 
contemplated by this Section 4.5 shall not be considered (i) 
Â“administrativeÂ” in nature or (ii) of Â“de minimis economic effectÂ”.

Section 5.4    Expansion of Terminals System; Committed Build-Outs; Tank 
Car Acquisitions.

(a)    Provider shall, at its sole cost and expense (i) design, construct 
and operate all Committed Build-Outs contained in the then-currently agreed 
Terminals System Plan (including the South Zone Pipelines), and (ii) 
acquire ownership or Control of all Tank Car Acquisitions contained in the 
then-currently agreed Terminals System Plan, in each case, for the purpose 
of providing System Services in accordance with this Agreement.

(b)    Provider is responsible, at its sole cost, for the acquisition and 
maintenance of rights of way, surface use and/or surface access agreements 
necessary to construct, own and operate the Terminals System and provide 
the System Services hereunder (including any Committed Build-Outs); 
provided, however, that in the event any right of way, surface use and/or 
surface access agreement necessary to construct, own or operate any 
Committed Build-Out (including any South Zone Pipelines) cannot be obtained 
on terms and conditions reasonably acceptable to Provider, then Provider 
shall not be obligated to complete any such Committed Build-Out (including 
any South Zone Pipelines). Provider agrees to provide Customer with 
quarterly updates as to the progress of any then-approved Committed 
Build-Outs (including any South Zone Pipelines) and Tank Car Acquisitions. 
Additionally, should Provider reasonably believe that any Committed 
Build-Out (including any South Zone Pipelines) will not be completed and 
placed in-service by the applicable Target Completion Date or proposed 
acquisition date reflected in the applicable Terminals System Plan, as 
applicable, Provider shall send written Notice to Customer of such delay 
promptly upon ProviderÂ’s determination that such delay will be reasonably 
likely to occur.

(c)    The Parties agree to work together in good faith to obtain the 
necessary permits and authorizations from the appropriate Governmental 
Authorities and the necessary consents, rights of way and other 
authorizations from other Persons necessary to construct, own and operate 
each Committed Build-Out (including any South Zone Pipelines) and acquire 
ownership or Control of each Tank Car Acquisition as expeditiously as 
reasonably practicable. The Parties further agree to cooperate with each 
other and to communicate regularly regarding their efforts to obtain such 
permits, authorizations, consents and rights of way.

(d)    Upon the completion of any Committed Build-Out (including any South 
Zone Pipelines) constituting a Planned Receipt Point or a Planned Delivery 
Point or consummation of any Tank Car Acquisition that results in a new 
Tank Car Delivery Point, the Parties shall amend Exhibit H, Exhibit I-1 or 
Exhibit I-2, as applicable, to include such new Receipt Point or Delivery 
Point.

MINIMUM VOLUME COMMITMENT; SHORTFALL CREDITS

Section 6.1    MVC.

(a)    For each Quarter beginning from and after January 1, 2017 during the 
Term, Customer shall be obligated to (i) Tender for delivery into the 
Terminals System a minimum volume of Eligible Customer Crude Oil (each such 
minimum amount, a Â“Crude Oil Minimum Volume CommitmentÂ” or Â“CMVCÂ”), and 
(ii) Tender into the Terminals System for redelivery at the Rail Loading 
Points pursuant to the provision of the NGL Services a minimum volume of 
Customer NGLs (each such minimum amount, a Â“NGL Minimum Volume CommitmentÂ” 
or Â“NMVCÂ”). The CMVC and NMVC are each referred to herein as a Â“Minimum 
Volume CommitmentÂ” or Â“MVCÂ”. The MVC for the Quarters occurring in Year 
2017 are set forth on Exhibit F attached hereto.

(b)    Following the Year 2016, the (i) CMVC with respect to any Quarter 
occurring in the then-subsequent three Year period shall be equal to 80% of 
the applicable Dedicated Crude Oil Estimate constituting Eligible Dedicated 
Crude Oil (such volume, an Â“Eligible Dedicated Crude Oil EstimateÂ”) for 
such Quarter contained in the then-currently agreed Development Plan, and 
(ii) NMVC with respect to any Quarter occurring in the then-subsequent 
three Year period shall be equal to 80% of the System NGL Estimates for 
such Quarter contained in the then-currently agreed Development Plan.

(c)    Notwithstanding the foregoing and regardless of the Eligible 
Dedicated Crude Oil Estimates or System NGL Estimates with respect to any 
such Quarter included in any Updated Development Plan, the MVCs for such 
Quarter contained in any prior Development Plan shall not be reduced by 
such Updated Development Plan (but the applicable volumes attributable to 
such MVCs may be increased).

(d)    Should any Eligible Dedicated Crude Oil be released (either 
permanently or temporarily) from the dedication contained in this Agreement 
pursuant to Section 4.3, the then-applicable MVCs shall be proportionately 
reduced by the portion of the then-current Eligible Dedicated Crude Oil 
Estimate so released. Should any such temporary release from dedication 
expire, then, upon such expiration, the then-applicable MVCs shall be 
proportionately increased by the portion of the applicable Eligible 
Dedicated Crude Oil Estimate that is no longer released from dedication 
hereunder.

(e)    Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, with respect to all 
periods prior to January 1, 2017, the definition of Â“MVCÂ” and its 
constituent sub-definitions contained in the Original Agreement and the MVC 
mechanisms contained in Section 6.1 of the Original Agreement shall, in 
each case, remain applicable hereunder.

Section 6.2    Shortfall Credits.

(a)    If Customer pays any NGL Shortfall Fee with respect to any Quarter 
in the NGL Services Secondary Term or thereafter, then, subject to the 
other provisions of this Section 6.2, for a period of four Quarters from 
the end of the Quarter in which such NGL Shortfall Fee was accrued, 
Customer shall be entitled to a credit with respect to the NGL Fees payable 
by Customer during any such Quarter in connection with volumes of Customer 
NGLs Tendered into the Terminals System by Customer during any such 
Quarter, but only to the extent such volumes so Tendered are in excess of 
the applicable System NGL Estimate for such Quarter (each such volume 
credit, stated in Barrels, a Â“Shortfall CreditÂ”).

(i)    During any subsequent Quarter in which an earned Shortfall Credit 
may be utilized by Customer, Customer may only utilize such Shortfall 
Credit for volumes of Customer NGLs Tendered into the Terminals System by 
Customer in excess of the applicable System NGL Estimate for such Quarter 
as contained in the then-currently agreed Development Plan.

(ii)    The use of a Shortfall Credit shall result in Customer not being 
obligated to pay an NGL Fee attributable to volumes of Customer NGLs, 
stated in Barrels, Tendered into the Terminals System by Customer, but only 
up to the amount of such Shortfall Credit and only with respect to volumes 
of Customer NGLs so Tendered in excess of the applicable System NGL 
Estimate for such Quarter as contained in the then-currently agreed 
Development Plan.

(b)    Each Shortfall Credit shall expire at the end of the fourth full 
Quarter following the date on which the applicable Shortfall Fee was 
accrued.

(c)    Provider shall be responsible for keeping records and balances of 
any applicable Shortfall Credits that have been earned by Customer and 
providing such balances to Customer upon CustomerÂ’s request.

(d)    The Parties agree that, as of January 1, 2017, there shall be no 
outstanding Â“Terminals Shortfall CreditsÂ”, Â“Loading Shortfall CreditsÂ”, 
Â“Tank Car Shortfall CreditsÂ” and Â“NGL Shortfall CreditsÂ” (in each case, as 
such terms are defined in the Original Agreement), and any such amounts 
that (i) have accrued on or prior to January 1, 2017 pursuant to the 
Original Agreement, but (ii) have not (or cannot) be utilized by Customer 
hereunder with respect to Customer Hydrocarbons Tendered to the Terminals 
System and/or Provider Tank Cars prior to January 1, 2017, shall be of no 
further force and effect and shall not be given any application hereunder. 
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary but subject to the first 
sentence of this Section 6.2(d), with respect to all periods prior to 
January 1, 2017, the definition of Â“Shortfall CreditsÂ” and its constituent 
sub-definitions contained in the Original Agreement and the Shortfall 
Credit mechanisms contained in Section 6.2 and elsewhere of the Original 
Agreement shall, in each case, remain applicable hereunder.

aggregate volumes, stated in Barrels, of Customer NGLs Tendered into the 
Terminals System by Customer or for CustomerÂ’s account for redelivery at 
the Rail Loading Points during such Quarter but not redelivered to such 
Rail Loading Points by Provider due to reasons of Force Majeure affecting 
Provider or curtailment, multiplied by (ii) the NGL Fee.

(e)    If any Updated Development Plan contains, for any Year, an Eligible 
Dedicated Crude Oil Estimate that is at least 15% greater than the Eligible 
Dedicated Crude Oil Estimate for such Year contained in the most recent 
previously agreed upon Development Plan, then the then-current Return on 
Capital shall be permanently increased by two-percent (2%) for each 15%

proportion that each such customer Tenders Hydrocarbons into the Terminals 
System at the Receipt Points. Customer shall bear all Product Losses or 
gains that may occur while any Customer Hydrocarbons are in the Terminals 
System (such Product Losses or gains, Â“Storage VariationsÂ”). Provider will, 
on a Monthly basis, determine the Storage Variations occurring during the 
immediately preceding Month with respect to the Customer Hydrocarbons in 
the Terminals System during such Month. CustomerÂ’s inventory of Customer 
Hydrocarbons then in the Terminals System shall then be adjusted to reflect 
such Storage Variation. On a Yearly basis, Provider will net all Storage 
Variations with respect to such Year together in order to determine the 
aggregate Storage Variations for the Year. Notwithstanding anything in the 
foregoing to the contrary, from and after the fourth anniversary of the 
Effective Time, Customer shall only bear Storage Variations pursuant to 
this Section 7.3 up to the Product Loss Allowance, and Provider shall bear 
all Storage Variations in excess of the Product Loss Allowance.

in connection with or resulting from any such curtailment; provided, 
however, that Provider shall, at CustomerÂ’s request, temporarily release 
from the dedication under this Agreement all of CustomerÂ’s volumes of 
Dedicated Crude Oil. Notwithstanding the foregoing, should any Governmental 
Authority issue an order requiring Provider to allocate capacity on the 
Terminals System to a customer other than Customer, Provider agrees to use 
its commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with, and support, 
Customer in such actions that Customer may in good faith take against such 
Governmental Authority and/or order; provided, however, that Provider shall 
not be required to cooperate in any such undertaking that Provider, in its 
good faith opinion, believes would materially and adversely affect Provider 
or the Terminals System.


Section 8.3    Tender of Dedicated Crude Oil; Additional Crude Oil; and 
Customer NGLs.

(a)    Subject to Article 14 and all applicable Laws, each Day during the 
Term Customer shall Tender to the Terminals System at each applicable 
Receipt Point all of the Dedicated Crude Oil available to Customer at such 
Receipt Point up to the applicable capacity of such Receipt Point; 
provided, however, that Customer shall only be required to Tender a single 
Barrel of Dedicated Crude Oil to the Terminals System at a Receipt Point a 
single time (e.g., if Customer Tenders a Barrel of Dedicated Crude Oil at a 
North Zone Receipt Point, then Customer is not required to also Tender such 
Barrel of Dedicated Crude Oil at any South Zone Receipt Point, and vice 
versa).

(b)    Customer shall have the right to Tender to Provider for System 
Services under this Agreement Additional Crude Oil; provided that, except 
as otherwise set forth in Section 8.1(a), any such Additional Crude Oil 
shall only be entitled to Interruptible Service unless otherwise agreed in 
writing by the Parties.

(c)    Subject to Article 14 and all applicable Laws, each Day during the 
Term Customer shall Tender to the Terminals System at each applicable 
Receipt Point all Customer NGLs available to Customer at such Receipt Point 
up to the lesser of (i) the applicable capacity of such Receipt Point, and 
(ii) **% of the then-current total capacity of the Terminals System.

Section 8.4    Nominations, Balancing and Curtailment. Nominations and 
balancing of Hydrocarbons available for, and interruptions and curtailment 
of, System Services under this Agreement shall be performed in accordance 
with the applicable Operating Terms set forth in Appendix I.


Section 8.5    Suspension/Shutdown of Service.

(a)    During any period when all or any portion of the Terminals System or 
the Provider Tank Cars are shut down because of necessary maintenance or 
repairs or Force Majeure or because such shutdown is necessary to avoid 
injury or harm to persons, property, the environment, or the integrity of 
the Terminals System or the Provider Tank Cars, receipts and/or deliveries 
of Customer Hydrocarbons may be curtailed as set forth in Section 1.5 of 
the Operating Terms. In such cases Provider shall have no liability to 
Customer, except to the extent such shut down is caused by the gross 
negligence or willful misconduct of the Provider.

(b)    Provider shall have the right to curtail or interrupt receipts and 
deliveries of Hydrocarbons for brief periods to perform necessary 
maintenance of and repairs or modifications (including modifications 
required to perform its obligations under this Agreement) to the Terminals 
System and/or the Provider Tank Cars; provided, however, that Provider 
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) coordinate its 
maintenance, repair, and modification operations on the Terminals System 
and the Provider Tank Cars with the operations of Customer and (ii) 
schedule maintenance, repair, and modification operations on the Terminals 
System and the Provider Tank Cars so as to avoid or minimize, to the 
greatest extent possible, service curtailments or interruptions on the 
Terminals System and the Provider Tank Cars. Provider shall provide 
Customer with (A) 30 Days prior Notice of any upcoming normal and routine 
maintenance, repair, and modification projects that Provider has planned 
that would result in a curtailment or interruption of CustomerÂ’s deliveries 
of Hydrocarbons on the Terminals System and/or the Provider Tank Cars and 
the estimated time period for such curtailment or interruption, whether or 
not such maintenance, repair or modifications activities are contained in 
the then-current System Budget, and (B) Notice of any amendment, 
modification or other change to the schedule of maintenance, repair or 
modifications activities contained in the then-current System Budget.

(c)    It is specifically understood by Customer that operations and 
activities on facilities upstream or downstream of the Terminals System 
and/or the Provider Tank Cars beyond ProviderÂ’s control may impact 
operations on the Terminals System and the Provider Tank Cars, and the 
Parties agree that Provider shall have no liability therefor. Customer is

required to obtain and maintain capacity on the Downstream Facilities 
applicable to each Delivery Point (including, as applicable, rail car take 
away capacity) that is sufficient to accommodate the greater of the volumes 
of Customer Hydrocarbons Nominated and Tendered by Customer to such 
Delivery Points. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 8.6, should 
Customer fail to arrange such adequate downstream transportation, Provider 
may (i) cease receipts of Customer Hydrocarbons at the Receipt Points, or 
(ii) may continue receipts of Customer Hydrocarbons at the Receipt Points 
and then deliver and sell any such Customer Hydrocarbons to any purchaser 
at its sole discretion, accounting to Customer for the net value received 
from the sale of such Hydrocarbons (after costs of transportation, taxes, 
and other costs of marketing).

(d)    If at any time Provider interrupts or curtails receipts and 
deliveries of Customer Hydrocarbons pursuant to this Section 8.5 (other 
than Section 8.5(c)) for a period of 30 consecutive Days, then, at 
CustomerÂ’s written request, the affected volumes of Dedicated Crude Oil 
shall be temporarily released from dedication to this Agreement for a 
period commencing as of the date of such request and ending as of the next 
first Day of a Month following the expiration date of CustomerÂ’s mitigating 
commercial arrangement for such Dedicated Crude Oil; provided that, in any 
event, such period shall end no more than 180 Days following CustomerÂ’s 
receipt of Notice from Provider that such receipts and deliveries are no 
longer interrupted or curtailed.

Section 8.6    Hydrocarbon Marketing and Transportation. As between the 
Parties, Customer shall be solely responsible for, and shall make all 
necessary arrangements at and downstream of the Delivery Points for, 
receipt, further transportation, processing, and marketing of Customer 
Hydrocarbons.

Section 8.7    Downstream Delivery Points. Provider shall use its 
commercially reasonable efforts to maintain, and shall act as a reasonable 
and prudent operator in maintaining, all interconnect and operating 
agreements with Non-Parties reasonably necessary to facilitate the 
redelivery of Customer Hydrocarbons to Customer at the Delivery Points.

Section 8.8    Loading Point Vetting. Customer shall have the obligation to 
ensure that procedures are in place such that all trucks and rail cars 
(other than the Provider Tank Cars) delivering Customer Hydrocarbons to a 
Receipt Point or taking Customer Hydrocarbons from a Delivery Point 
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Loading Point), meet the 
Applicable Requirements and all Terminal Rules. Provider shall advise 
Customer of such standards and any changes thereto.


ARTICLE 9 QUALITY SPECIFICATIONS

Section 9.1    Quality Specifications. All Crude Oil and NGLs delivered at 
the Receipt Points by Customer to Provider shall meet the respective 
quality specifications for such Hydrocarbons as set forth in Section 1.1 
of the Operating Terms.

BEEN MARKED AT THE APPROPRIATE PLACE WITH TWO ASTERISKS (**).
 
(a)    Provided that the Customer Hydrocarbons delivered to the Receipt 
Points comply with the applicable quality specifications set forth in 
Section 1.1 of the Operating Terms, all corresponding Hydrocarbons 
redelivered at the Delivery Points by Provider to Customer shall meet the 
quality specifications of the applicable Downstream Facilities at the 
relevant Delivery Points; provided, however, that in the event any such 
quality specifications of the applicable Downstream Facilities change from 
and after the date of this Agreement, ProviderÂ’s obligations under this 
Section 9.1(a) shall be subject to the provisions of Section 1.1(b) of the 
Operating Terms.

(b)    The Parties recognize and agree that Customer Hydrocarbons received 
by Provider into the Terminals System and the Provider Tank Cars may be 
commingled with other Hydrocarbon volumes and, subject to ProviderÂ’s 
obligation set forth in Section 9.1(a), (i) such Hydrocarbons shall be 
subject to such changes in quality, composition and other characteristics 
as may result from such commingling, and (ii) Provider shall have no other 
obligation to Customer associated with changes in quality of Hydrocarbons 
as the result of such commingling.

(c)    As of the date of this Agreement, Provider and the Terminals System 
will provide the System Services to Customer Crude Oil, regardless to which 
Packing Group such Customer Crude Oil is allocated to at such Customer 
Crude OilÂ’s receipt into the Terminals System, and Provider shall not 
distinguish or discriminate among Customer Crude Oil of different Packing 
Groups, whether in terms of priority of service, additional fees or 
charges, or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Provider should 
determine, in its sole discretion, at any time during the Term of this 
Agreement, that any distinction should be made with respect to Barrels of 
Customer Crude Oil utilizing the System Services based on the Packing Group 
attributable to such Barrel of Customer Crude Oil, then:

(i)    the Parties hereby agree to negotiate in good faith to enter into 
such amendments to this Agreement and/or a separate arrangement in order to 
give effect to such distinction (including the addition of additional fees, 
priority modifications and quality restrictions, among others); and

(ii)    in the event that the Parties are not successful in accomplishing 
the objectives set forth in (i) above such that, following the failure to 
accomplish such objectives, Provider is not in substantially the same 
economic position as it was prior to any such determination, then Provider 
may terminate this Agreement upon the delivery of written Notice of 
termination to Customer.

TERMINATION

Section 10.1    Termination.

(a)    This Agreement may be terminated in its entirety as follows:

(i)    by Provider upon written Notice to Customer, if Customer fails to 
pay any Invoice rendered pursuant to Section 12.2 and such failure is not 
remedied within 30 Days of written Notice of such failure to Customer by 
Provider;

Party fails to perform or comply with any material warranty, covenant or 
obligation contained in this Agreement (other than (A) as provided above in 
Section 10.1(a)(i), (B) for reasons of Force Majeure in accordance with 
Article 14, or (C) with respect to any material warranty, covenant or 
obligation contained in this Agreement for which this Agreement expressly 
sets forth a specific remedy or consequence (other than termination) as a 
result of any breach of, or failure to comply with, such material warranty, 
covenant or obligation), and such failure has not been remedied within 60 
Days after receipt of written Notice from the non-defaulting Party of such 
failure;

(iii)    by Provider upon written Notice to Customer, if either of Customer 
or Customer Parent (A) makes an assignment or any general arrangement for 
the benefit of creditors, (B) files a petition or otherwise commences, 
authorizes, or acquiesces in the commencement of a proceeding or cause 
under any bankruptcy or similar Law for the protection of creditors or has 
such petition filed or proceeding commenced against either of them, or (C) 
otherwise becomes bankrupt or insolvent (however evidenced);

(iv)    by Provider upon written Notice to Customer pursuant to the 
provisions of Section 15.4(c); and

(v)    by Provider upon written Notice to Customer pursuant to the 
provisions of Section 18.2; and

(b)    This Agreement may be terminated if the Terminals System is 
Uneconomic during any six consecutive Months, by Provider upon written 
Notice to Customer delivered within 180 Days following the end of such 
sixth consecutive Month.

(i)    As used herein, Â“UneconomicÂ” means that the total direct cash costs 
and direct cash expenses incurred by Provider in the operation of the 
Terminals System exceeds the total net revenues received by Provider for 
the operation of the Terminals System, all as determined in accordance with 
United States generally accepted accounting principles.

(ii)    Should Provider reasonably believe that the Terminals System will 
be Uneconomic for more than three consecutive Months, Provider shall advise 
Customer of such belief and shall provide Customer with supporting 
documentation reasonably necessary to confirm such Uneconomic status.

(iii)    Promptly following Provider advising Customer of such potential 
Uneconomic status, the Parties shall meet to discuss ProviderÂ’s belief and 
related calculations and any measures that may be taken by the Parties to 
mitigate and/or reverse the Uneconomic status of the Terminals System.

(iv)    Should (A) the Parties fail to reach agreement upon any such 
appropriate mitigation measures prior to the date upon which Provider would 
otherwise be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 
10.1(b), (B) the Parties reasonably believe that agreement upon such 
mitigation measures will nevertheless be possible, and (C) Customer makes 
Provider whole during any such Uneconomic periods occurring during such 
negotiation period such that, due to CustomerÂ’s payment efforts, the 
operation of the Terminals System is not Uneconomic to Provider (whether 
through Customer paying of the operating costs of the Terminals System or 
otherwise), then for so long as subparts (B) and (C) of this Section 
10.1(b)(iv) remain true, Provider shall not be entitled to exercise its 
termination rights pursuant to this Section 10.1(b).

(v)    Upon the implementation of any such mitigating measures hereunder, 
should (A) the Uneconomic condition cease to exist for three consecutive 
Months, and (B) the reversion of any such mitigating measures not be 
reasonably likely to cause such Uneconomic condition to return, then any 
terms of this Agreement affected by such mitigating measures will revert 
back to the terms in effect prior to ProviderÂ’s declaration of Uneconomic 
status pursuant to this Section 10.1(b).


Section 10.2    Effect of Termination or Expiration of the Term.

(a)    Upon the end of the Term (whether pursuant to a termination pursuant 
to Section 10.1(a) or otherwise), this Agreement shall forthwith become 
void and the Parties shall have no liability or obligation under this 
Agreement, except that (i) the termination of this Agreement shall not 
relieve any Party from any expense, liability or other obligation or remedy 
therefor which has accrued or attached prior to the date of such

Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1(a)(i),
Section 10.1(a)(ii), Section 10.1(a)(iii), or Section 10.1(a)(v), then such 
terminating Party may pursue any and all remedies at law or in equity for

(a)    Customer hereby grants Provider a security interest upon all 
Customer Hydrocarbons while such Hydrocarbons are in ProviderÂ’s possession 
pursuant to this Agreement, including any such Customer Hydrocarbons for 
which Tank Car Services are being provided hereunder while such 
Hydrocarbons remain in a Provider Tank Car (such Customer Hydrocarbons, the 
Â“Stored InventoryÂ”), with such security interest being granted in order to 
secure the full, prompt and complete payment of any amounts which may 
become due and owing by Customer hereunder.

(b)    Provider may exercise any and all rights and remedies available in 
relation to such security interest, in the manner provided below, only in 
the event that (i) Customer fails to pay when due any amounts owed pursuant 
to this Agreement within five Business Days after the applicable due date 
thereof, and (ii) such failure has not been cured within five Business Days 
following CustomerÂ’s receipt of written Notice from Provider of ProviderÂ’s 
intent to exercise its rights regarding such security interest granted in 
the Stored Inventory (the Â“Security Interest Exercise NoticeÂ”).

(c)    Without prejudice to any other remedies that Provider may have at 
law, in equity and/or pursuant to the terms and provisions hereof, if 
Customer has not paid in full the outstanding amounts owed within five 
Business Days following CustomerÂ’s receipt of ProviderÂ’s

interest granted herein by public or private sale of any or all of the 
Stored Inventory remaining in ProviderÂ’s possession at any time or place 
and on any terms that Provider, in its sole discretion, deems commercially 
reasonable.

(d)    Customer (i) represents and warrants that no prior liens or security 
interests have been granted in, on or to the Stored Inventory that would be 
prior to, or otherwise defeat or supersede, the security interest and other 
rights granted by Customer to Provider under this Section 11.3, and (ii) 
within 10 Business Days following request by Provider, agrees to execute 
UCC-1 Financing Statements to be filed in the appropriate offices of 
Governmental Authorities to evidence and give notice of ProviderÂ’s lien and

CustomerÂ’s receipt of the applicable Invoice. All payments by Customer 
under this Agreement shall be made by electronic funds transfer of 
immediately available funds to the account designated by Provider in the 
applicable Invoice. Any amounts not paid by the due date will be deemed 
delinquent and will accrue interest at the Interest Rate, such interest to 
be calculated from and including the due date but excluding the date the 
delinquent amount is paid in full. All Invoices shall be paid in full, but 
payment of any disputed amount shall not waive the payorÂ’s right to dispute 
the Invoice in accordance with this Section 12.2. Customer may, in good 
faith (i) dispute the correctness of any Invoice or any adjustment to an 
Invoice rendered under this Agreement or (ii) request an adjustment of any 
Invoice for any arithmetic or computational error, in each case, within 24 
Months following the date on which the applicable Invoice (or adjustment

Invoice adjustment requested by Customer shall be made in writing and shall 
state the basis for such dispute or adjustment. Upon resolution of the 
dispute, any required payment shall be made within ten Business Days of 
such resolution, along with interest accrued at the Interest Rate from and 
including the due date but excluding the date paid.

Section 14.2    Actions. If either Provider or Customer is rendered unable 
by an event of Force Majeure to carry out, in whole or part, its 
obligations under this Agreement and such Party gives Notice and reasonably 
full details of the event to the other Party as soon as practicable after 
the occurrence of the event, then, during the pendency of such Force 
Majeure, but only during that period, the obligations of the Party affected 
by the event shall be canceled or suspended, as applicable, to the extent 
required; provided, however, that notwithstanding anything in the foregoing 
to the contrary, neither Party shall be relieved from any indemnification 
obligation or any obligation to make any payments hereunder as the result 
of Force Majeure, regardless which Party is affected. The Party affected by 
Force Majeure shall use commercially reasonable efforts to remedy the Force 
Majeure condition with all reasonable dispatch, shall give Notice to the 
other Party of the termination of the Force Majeure, and shall resume 
performance of any suspended obligation promptly after termination of such 
Force Majeure. If the Party affected by such Force Majeure is Customer and 
such Force Majeure is an event affecting a Delivery Point (but not all 
Delivery Points), such commercially reasonable efforts shall require, to 
the extent of capacity available to Customer at the applicable Downstream 
Facilities, Customer to Nominate Customer Hydrocarbons for redelivery at 
those Delivery Points not affected by such Force Majeure. For the avoidance 
of doubt, if and to the extent Provider is delayed in completing any 
Committed Build-Outs by a Force Majeure event, then the Target Completion 
Date applicable thereto shall be extended for a period of time equal to 
that during which such obligations of Provider were delayed by such events.

Section 14.3    Strikes, Etc. The settlement of strikes or lockouts shall 
be entirely within the discretion of the Claiming Party, and any obligation 
hereunder to remedy a Force Majeure event shall not require the settlement 
of strikes or lockouts by acceding to the demands of the opposing Person(s) 
when such course is inadvisable in the sole discretion of the Claiming 
Party.

under this Agreement (in whole or in part) to another Person; provided that 
(i) such transferee has also been assigned the Exclusive Producer Purchase 
Right (including any contract or other arrangement forming a part of such

and obligations hereunder, and (iii) the transferee has, in ProviderÂ’s good 
faith and reasonable judgment, the financial and operational capability to

entitled to assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement (in 
whole or in part) to another Person; provided that (A) such Person has 
acquired all or a portion of the Terminals System and/or Provider Tank Cars 
and (B) the portion of the rights and obligations of Provider under this

CUSTOMER GUARANTEE; ADEQUATE ASSURANCES

Section 18.1    Customer Guarantee. Concurrently with the execution of the 
Original Agreement, Customer delivered to Provider a guarantee from Hess 
Corporation, the direct or indirect owner of 100% of the issued and 
outstanding shares of Customer (Â“Customer ParentÂ”), which guarantee 
provides a guarantee of all of CustomerÂ’s obligations under this Agreement.

Section 18.2    Adequate Assurances. If (a) Customer fails to pay any 
Invoice according to the provisions hereof and such failure continues for a 
period of five Business Days after written Notice of such failure is 
provided to Customer or (b) Provider has reasonable grounds for insecurity 
regarding the performance by Customer of any obligation under this 
Agreement, then Provider, by delivery of written Notice to Customer, may, 
singularly or in combination with any other rights it may have, demand 
Adequate Assurance by Customer. As used herein, Â“Adequate AssuranceÂ” means, 
at the option of Customer, (i) the advance payment in cash by Customer to 
Provider for System Services to be provided under this Agreement in the 
following Month or (ii) delivery to Provider by Customer of an Adequate 
Letter of Credit in an amount equal to not less than the aggregate amounts 
owed from Customer to Provider hereunder for the prior two Month period. If 
(A) Customer fails to provide Adequate Assurance to Provider within 48 
hours of ProviderÂ’s request therefor pursuant to this Section 18.2 or (B) 
Customer or Customer Parent suffers any of the actions described in 
Section 10.1(a)(iii), then, in either case, Provider shall have the right 
to, at its sole option, terminate this Agreement upon written Notice to 
Customer or suspend or reduce all services under this Agreement without 
prior Notice to Customer, in each case, without limiting any other rights 
or remedies available to Provider under this Agreement or otherwise. If 
Provider exercises the right to terminate this Agreement or suspend or 
reduce any System Services under this Section 18.2, then Customer shall not 
be entitled to take, or cause to be taken, any action hereunder or 
otherwise against Provider for such termination, suspension or reduction. 
Failure of Provider to exercise its right to terminate this Agreement or 
suspend or reduce any System Service as provided in this Section 18.2 
shall not constitute a waiver by Provider of any rights or remedies 
Provider may have under this Agreement, applicable Law, or otherwise.

of any Party, or their respective officers, employees, agents, or 
representatives, and no failure by a Party to exercise any of its rights 
under this Agreement, shall, in either case, operate as a waiver thereof or 
affect in any way the right of such Party at a later time to enforce the 
performance of such provision. No waiver by any Party of any condition, or 
any breach of any term or covenant contained in this Agreement, in any one 
or more instances, shall be deemed to be or construed as a further or 
continuing waiver of any such condition or breach or a waiver of any other 
condition or of any breach of any other term or covenant. The rights of the 
Parties under this Agreement shall be cumulative, and the exercise or 
partial exercise of any such right shall not preclude the exercise of any 
other right.

the Terminals System and/or the Provider Tank Cars, as applicable, to each 
such class of service under the preceding sentence shall be allocated among 
the holders of each such class of service on a pro rata basis, based on the 
percentage derived by dividing the Daily average volume of Hydrocarbons 
actually Tendered by each holder of the applicable class of service to 
Receipt Points during the prior 90 Day period by the total volume of such 
Hydrocarbons actually Tendered by all holders of the applicable class of 
service during such period to Receipt Points on the Terminals System and 
the Provider Tank Cars. As among holders of Interruptible Service, the 
capacity available to such service, if any, shall be allocated pro rata 
among the holders of such service based on the percentage derived by 
dividing the Daily average volume of Hydrocarbons actually Tendered by each 
holder of Interruptible Service to Receipt Points on the Terminals System 
and the Provider Tank Cars during the prior 60 Day period by the total 
volume of such Hydrocarbons actually Tendered by all holders of 
Interruptible Service to Receipt Points on the Terminals System and the 
Provider Tank Cars during such period. During periods of curtailment on the 
Terminals System and/or the Provider Tank Cars, the Parties shall meet to 
review alternative options for Customer to optimize its overall volume 
throughput and related revenues in light of the specific constraints 
causing such curtailment on the Terminals System and/or the Provider Tank 
Cars.

1.6    Allocations. Allocations required for determining payments or fees 
due under this Agreement shall be made by Provider. This Section 1.6 of the 
Operating Terms shall be based upon the measurements taken and quantities 
determined for the applicable Month. The Storage Variation shall, with 
respect to each Month and each type of Hydrocarbon, be determined by the 
following formula: (a) the sum of (i) the aggregate of all Barrels of such 
Hydrocarbon Tendered into the Terminals System during such Month, plus 
(ii) the aggregate of all Barrels of such Hydrocarbon remaining in storage 
on the Terminals System at the beginning of such Month that were Tendered 
into the Terminals System during prior Months, minus (b) the sum of (i) the 
aggregate Barrels of such Hydrocarbon withdrawn from storage pursuant to 
the direction of the applicable customers on the Terminals System during 
such Month and redelivered by or on behalf of Provider to the Delivery 
Points during such Month, plus (ii) the aggregate of all Barrels of such 
Hydrocarbon remaining in storage on the Terminals System at the end of such 
Month.

SERVICE INTERFACE RULES

1.1    Generally. These Service Interface Rules set forth certain rules and 
procedures according to which Provider will provide certain of the System 
Services to Customer, including the Tank Car Services and certain other 
Crude Oil Services.

1.2    Train Scheduling. Customer shall be responsible for arranging and 
coordinating rail transportation for any Customer Hydrocarbons delivered by 
or on behalf of Provider to the Rail Loading Points, regardless whether or 
not such Customer Hydrocarbons are to utilize the Tank Car Services 
hereunder.

(a)    With respect to any Customer Hydrocarbons that are Nominated for 
delivery to the Rail Loading Points but that will not be utilizing the Tank 
Car Services (such Customer Hydrocarbons, Â“Non-Party Rail HydrocarbonsÂ”), 
Customer shall, as promptly as possible, keep Provider regularly informed 
as to (i) any rail transportation provider Customer has contracted to move 
such Non-Party Rail Hydrocarbons, (ii) the number and dimensions of any 
Non-Party owned Trains and Tank Cars (Â“Non-Party TrainsÂ”) that Customer has 
contracted to carry (or expects to contract to carry) such Non-Party Rail 
Hydrocarbons, and (iii) the planned destinations of any such Non-Party 
Trains, if available.

(b)    At all times during the Term, Customer shall have under contract 
with rail transportation providers sufficient Non-Party Trains to move all 
Non-Party Rail Hydrocarbons Nominated by Customer (or expected to be 
Nominated by Customer) pursuant to this Agreement as Provider and Customer 
shall reasonably agree are necessary or advisable to (i) take away all such 
Non-Party Rail Hydrocarbons from the Terminals in a timely manner, and (ii) 
prevent Bunching. In making such determinations, the Parties shall take 
into consideration all relevant factors, including: (A) the destinations 
for such Non-Party Rail Hydrocarbons, (B) the expected loading and 
offloading time of such Non-Party Trains, and (C) bad car rates, 
maintenance and repair estimates and expected service interruption rates.

(c)    Customer shall have an obligation to maintain at or near the 
Terminals readily available spare parts for Non-Party Trains consistent 
with reasonably anticipated repair and replacement needs, as notified to 
Customer or posted on ProviderÂ’s website from time to time. Customer shall 
promptly remove from the Terminals any Non-Party Trains requiring repairs, 
unless Customer has retained Provider to perform such repairs. In the event 
Customer does not have readily available at or near the Terminals a spare 
part needed to repair a Non-Party Train, in addition to other remedies to 
which Provider may be entitled, Provider may bad order the applicable 
Non-Party owned Tank Car.

(d)    Customer shall use reasonable efforts to arrange rail transportation 
for all Non-Party Rail Hydrocarbons at such times and at such rates that 
are substantially even and coordinated with its Tendering of Customer 
Hydrocarbons at the Receipt Points and Nominations for delivery of such 
Non-Party Rail Hydrocarbons to the Rail Loading Points and otherwise in a 
manner that minimizes the amount and duration of storage of Non-Party Rail 
Hydrocarbons on the Terminals System and prevents Bunching.

truck transportation provider may reasonably request. Customer shall 
provide Provider with as much advance notice as possible with respect to 
any alteration to any Nomination, including any change in the proposed 
Arrival Time, Train or Truck size, and Tank Car or Truck dimensions. 
Customer shall additionally permit Provider to coordinate any alterations 
to an agreed Arrival Time directly with the applicable rail or truck 
transportation provider, as applicable.

(b)    In accordance with such agreed Arrival Times, Customer shall have 
the right to bring its Non-Party Trains and Trucks to the Terminals for 
purposes of loading and unloading, as applicable, Customer Hydrocarbons (in 
accordance with and to the extent agreed in accordance with the Agreement, 
including the Nomination provisions hereof). Provider shall use its 
commercially reasonable efforts to provide the Crude Oil Services or NGL 
Services, as applicable, with respect to such Customer Hydrocarbons in a 
timely manner. Customer shall use reasonable efforts to cause all Trucks 
and Non-Party Trains to depart from the Terminals in a timely manner 
following the applicable loading or offloading of such Nominated Customer 
Hydrocarbons.

EXHIBIT A-1
RAMBERG TERMINAL FACILITY

The RTF is a Crude Oil truck unloading and pipeline receipt terminal 
located in Williams County, North Dakota that receives Crude Oil by 
pipeline and truck and exports Crude Oil by transporting such Crude Oil via 
pipeline to the TRT for loading onto Crude Oil rail cars or by injecting 
such Crude Oil directly into third party interstate pipeline systems. The 
RTF was constructed in 2006 and expanded in 2012.

Crude Oil enters the RTF through six separate pipelines that gather up to 
109,000 Barrels/Day of Crude Oil, as well as through fourteen truck 
unloading bays with a combined truck unloading capacity of 67,000 
Barrels/Day resulting in a combined truck and pipeline receipts capability 
of 176,000 Barrels/Day. Additionally, the RTF has a combined shell storage 
capacity of 39,000 Barrels.

The RTF has a redelivery capability of 130,000 Barrels/Day through certain 
of the Logistics Pipelines.

EXHIBIT B-1
DEDICATED AREA; EXCLUDED FIELDS

The Â“Dedicated AreaÂ” is the entire Bakken Area.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, as of the Effective Time, the Parties have 
agreed that the Excluded Fields shall be temporarily released from the 
dedication hereunder, but only with respect to Customer Crude Oil formerly 
owned or Controlled by Producer and produced from those oil and gas 
properties located in the Excluded Fields that are operated by Producer 
(the Â“Temporary ReleaseÂ”). The Temporary Release shall be effective for a 
period of three Years from and after the Effective Time; provided, however, 
that the Temporary Release may be extended, as to each then-applicable 
Excluded Field, on a Year-to-Year basis, and in each case, for a period of 
one additional Year. The Parties shall use their good faith efforts to 
reach agreement on whether to extend all or a portion of the Temporary 
Release on or prior to July 1 of each Year in which the Temporary Release 
remains applicable. Should the Parties be unable to mutually agree, on or 
prior to such July 1 date, whether to extend all or a portion of the 
Temporary Release as of such time, the Parties shall utilize the executive 
negotiation provisions of Section 5.3(e) to resolve such dispute. If, 
following the implementation of the provisions of Section 5.3(e), (a) no 
agreement has been reached pursuant to Section 5.3(e) by December 31 of 
such Year, then the then-applicable Temporary Release shall automatically 
be extended for one additional year, or (b) it is determined that all or a 
portion of the Temporarily Release then-in effect should not be extended, 
then such portion(s) of the Temporary Release may not then be later 
extended in a subsequent Year.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Temporary Release does not affect any 
Customer Crude Oil formerly owned or Controlled by Producer and produced 
from those oil and gas properties located in the Excluded Fields that are 
not operated by Producer, but from which Producer has elected to take its 
applicable production in-kind.

The Â“Excluded FieldsÂ” are more particularly described below. The Excluded 
Fields referenced below are (i) field name references utilized by Producer 
and Customer and do not correlate to specific North Dakota Industrial 
Commission field names, and (ii) defined by the maps included on the 
following pages.

FEE RECALCULATION MODEL


Original Methodology
 
  	Â• 	  	The fee recalculation model will include 20 Years of cash flows 
from 2014 to 2033 for Crude Oil Services and 10 Years of cash flows from 
2014 to 2023 for NGL Services.
 
  	Â• 	  	The production profile used will be based on the Current 
Development Plan. To the extent appropriate, the production profile is 
adjusted by an operating factor of **% to reflect realistic operations. 
Further, the Current Development Plan will be adjusted to reflect major 
maintenance and turnarounds.
 
  	Â• 	  	Initial capital (opening balance) is based upon net book value as 
of December 31, 2013.
 
  	Â• 	  	From and after January 1, 2017 only, the NPV True-Up to be added 
in Year 2017 for Crude Oil Services only.
 
  	Â• 	  	Committed Build-Out Costs and Maintenance Capital Estimates are 
based on the Current Terminals System Plan.
 
  	Â• 	  	Operating Expense Estimates are derived from the Current Terminals 
System Plan.
 
  	Â• 	  	Includes projected public company and executive management costs 
allocated on a pro rata basis to the assets.
 
  	Â• 	  	Includes major maintenance and turnaround expenses
 
  	Â• 	  	Â“Residual ValueÂ” equals (a) zero for Crude Oil Services and (b) 
(i) the sum of initial capital and Committed Build-Out Costs over the NGL 
Services Initial Term (10 years), multiplied by (ii) (A) one, minus (B) (y) 
the ratio of cumulative throughput from the Current Development Plan in the 
NGL Services Initial Term (10 years), divided by (z) the cumulative 
throughput from the Current Development Plan over the full plan period (20 
years) for NGL Services. For the avoidance of doubt, when calculating the 
cumulative throughput in subparts (y) and (z) above, the actual throughput 
volumes shall be used for Years 2014, 2015 and 2016.
 
  	Â• 	  	The Return on Capital (unadjusted), using a mid-year convention, 
was utilized.
 
  	Â• 	  	Fees are expressed as an escalating $/Mcf or $/Barrel, as 
applicable, figure required to achieve the Return on Capital.
 
  	Â• 	  	Fees are escalated based on the average annual percentage change 
in the CPI for the 10 years prior to each Recalculation Election date and 
will be expressed on an annual basis in forward years.
 
  	Â• 	  	If applicable, pass-through costs (power and utilities, other) and 
market-based revenue streams
(compression fees, short-haul/injection fees, other) are set to offset 
costs to be recovered.

Redetermination Methodology

Each year, if a Recalculation Election is made pursuant to Section 7.1(f), 
the Fees will be recalculated to reflect:
 
  	Â• 	  	The enumerated items in Section 7.1(f)(i) through (xiv).
 
  	Â• 	  	For the avoidance of doubt, any Tank Car Acquisition Costs and 
Tank Car Acquisition Costs Estimates will be allocated between the Crude 
Oil Services and NGL Services recalculation models appropriately based on 
the actual or estimated costs for each type of Tank Cars (Crude Oil or NGL) 
so acquired (or planned to be acquired).
 
  	Â• 	  	Should Provider and its Affiliates receive any cash or non-cash 
consideration in respect of the sale or other disposition of any 1232 Cars 
(Â“1232 ConsiderationÂ”), the value of any such 1232 Consideration shall be 
deducted from the Crude Oil Service recalculation model in the Year it is 
received, up to the amount of (a) actual Tank Car Acquisition Costs 
incurred between January 1, 2017 and the Year the 1232 Consideration is 
received less (b) any 1232 Consideration that has been deducted in prior 
Years. Any remaining 1232 Consideration shall be deducted in subsequent 
Years when further actual Tank Car Acquisition Costs are incurred, up to 
the amount of such costs.
 
  	Â• 	  	The present value of prior year(s) revenue and throughput will be 
subtracted from the Â“Required Cost RecoveryÂ” and Â“Escalating Tariff 
ThroughputÂ” (as each such term is used in the following example 
calculations) calculations so that the new Fees reflect costs to be 
recovered over the remaining Term coupled with expected throughput.
 
  	Â• 	  	Operating Expense Estimates based upon the latest updated 
Terminals System Plan for the applicable year and subsequent years. Prior 
year(s) operating expenses will not be trued-up to actuals.
 
  	Â• 	  	Projected public company and executive management costs allocated 
on a pro rata basis to the assets.
 
  	Â• 	  	Major maintenance and turnaround expenses not otherwise included 
in the above listed items.
 
  	Â• 	  	Any scheduled downtime of the Terminals System.
 
  	Â• 	  	Adjusted Residual Value based on latest Updated Development Plan.
 
  	Â• 	  	All other assumptions will be the same as the Original Methodology 
set forth above.

2. 	For each Year during the Term following the first Year of the NGL 
Services Secondary Term, the NGL Fee shall be an amount equal to: (a) the 
amount of such Fee for the immediately preceding Year (as calculated
