ARTICLE II

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE MATTERS

2.1    Composition of the Board.

(a) From and after the Effective Date, subject to the terms and conditions 
of this Article II, the HNA Designator shall have the right (but not the 
obligation) to designate, and the individuals nominated for election as 
Directors by or at the direction of the Board or a duly-authorized 
committee thereof shall include, two (2) individuals that meet the Designee 
Qualifications to serve as Directors; provided, that, if the Total Number 
of Directors is fourteen (14) or more, then the HNA Designator shall be 
entitled to designate one (1)
 
9

------------------------------------------------------------------------
additional individual that meets the Designee Qualifications for each three 
(3) Directors in excess of eleven (11) Directors. For clarity: if and when 
the Total Number of Directors is at least fourteen (14) but less than 
seventeen (17), the HNA Designator shall be entitled to designate three (3) 
Directors; if and when the Total Number of Directors is at least seventeen 
(17) but less than twenty (20), the HNA Designator shall be entitled to 
designate four (4) Directors; etc. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Total 
Number of Directors is increased to fourteen (14) or more and then 
subsequently reduced, the number of individuals that the HNA Designator is 
entitled to designate pursuant to this Section 2.1(a) shall be reduced to 
the number of individuals that the HNA Designator would otherwise be 
entitled to designate pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 
2.1(a); provided, that such number of designees shall increase in 
accordance with the first sentence of this Section 2.1(a) if the Total 
Number of Directors is thereafter increased to fourteen (14) or more. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.1(a), but 
subject to the proviso set forth in Section 2.7, the number of individuals 
that the HNA Designator is entitled to designate to serve as Directors 
pursuant to this Section 2.1(a) shall be reduced to: (i) two (2) Directors 
if, at any time, the HNA Entities, in the aggregate, Beneficially Own at 
least fifteen percent (15%) but less than twenty percent (20%) of the total 
number of shares of Common Stock outstanding; (ii) one (1) Director if, at 
any time, the HNA Entities, in the aggregate, Beneficially Own at least 
five percent (5%) but less than fifteen percent (15%) of the total number 
of shares of Common Stock outstanding; and (iii) no Directors if, at any 
time, the HNA Entities, in the aggregate, Beneficially Own less than five 
percent (5%) of the total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding. Not 
more than one HNA Designee at any time may be an Affiliated HNA Designee, 
and any other HNA Designee shall be an Independent HNA Designee.

(b) If at any time the HNA Designator has designated fewer than the total 
number of individuals that the HNA Designator is then entitled to designate 
pursuant to Section 2.1(a), the HNA Designator shall have the right (but 
not the obligation) to designate such number of additional individuals who 
meet the Designee Qualifications that the HNA Designator is entitled to so 
designate, in which case, any individuals nominated by or at the direction 
of the Board or any duly-authorized committee thereof for election as 
Directors to fill any vacancy or newly created directorships on the Board 
shall include such designees, and the Company shall use its best efforts to 
(x) effect the election of such additional designees, whether by increasing 
the size of the Board or otherwise, and (y) cause the election of such 
additional designees to fill any such newly-created vacancies or to fill 
any other existing vacancies. Each such individual whom the HNA Designator 
shall actually designate pursuant to this Section 2.1 and who qualifies to 
serve and is thereafter elected as a Director shall be referred to herein 
as a HNA Designee.

(c) In the event that a vacancy is created at any time by the death, 
disability, retirement, removal or resignation of any HNA Designee, any 
individual nominated or appointed by or at the direction of the Board or 
any duly-authorized committee thereof to fill such vacancy shall be, and 
the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such vacancy to 
be filled by, a new designee of the HNA Designator who meets the Designee 
Qualifications, and the Company and the Board shall take, to the fullest 
extent permitted by Law, at any time and from time to time, all actions 
necessary to accomplish the same as soon as possible following such 
designation.
 
10

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(d) The Company and the Board shall take all action necessary to cause two 
(2) individuals designated by the HNA Designator who meet the Designee 
Qualifications to be appointed to the Board immediately on the Effective 
Date ; provided, however, that if the Effective Date occurs after mailing 
of the Companys proxy statement relating to its annual meeting of 
stockholders for 2017 but prior to such annual meeting, such appointment 
shall occur immediately after such annual meeting.

(e) For any designation pursuant to this Section 2.1 that occurs after the 
Effective Date in connection with an election of Directors by the 
stockholders of the Company, the HNA Designator shall identify its 
designees by written notice to the Company no less than ninety (90) days 
prior to the date of the meeting of stockholders of the Company called for 
the purpose of electing Directors. So long as an individual designated by 
the HNA Designator pursuant to this Section 2.1 meets the Designee 
Qualifications, the Company shall, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, 
include such individual in the slate of nominees recommended by the Board 
at any meeting of stockholders called for the purpose of electing 
Directors, and use its reasonable best efforts to cause the election of 
such individual to the Board, including nominating such individual to be 
elected as a Director as provided herein, recommending such individuals 
election and soliciting proxies or consents in favor thereof.

(f) The Company shall at all times provide each HNA Designee (in his or her 
capacity as a member of the Board) with the same rights to indemnification 
and exculpation that it provides to other Directors.

2.2    Size of the Board. Without prejudice to the HNA Designators rights 
pursuant to Section 2.1, the consent of the HNA Designator shall not be 
required to increase or decrease the Total Number of Directors.

2.3    Committees.

(a) Each Independent HNA Designee serving as a Director on the Board shall 
be entitled to serve on at least one (1) committee of the Board (to the 
extent that an Independent HNA Designee elects to serve on such committee 
and subject to such Independent HNA Designee meeting the applicable 
eligibility requirements for membership on such committee mandated by 
applicable Law, the rules of the Exchange or the charter of such 
committee), as a full member with the same voting and other privileges as 
other members of such committee. The committee(s) on which any Independent 
HNA Designee serves shall be determined by the Nominating and Corporate 
Governance Committee.

(b) Until no HNA Designee serves as a Director on the Board (and the HNA 
Designator either no longer has any rights under this Article II to 
designate any HNA Designee to serve on the Board or irrevocably waives any 
such rights), the Company shall not amend the certificate of incorporation, 
bylaws or any other organizational documents of the Company, or the charter 
or other governing documents of any committee of the Board, in any manner 
that adversely and disparately affects the right of any Independent HNA 
Designee to be a member of any such committee (except as otherwise required 
by Law or the rules of the Exchange).
 
11

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(c) Each HNA Designee may attend, upon the request of such HNA Designee and 
on a non-voting basis, any meetings of the Audit Committee, Compensation 
Committee, Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee or other standing 
committee of the Board that may be established, except when such attendance 
would present an actual or potential conflict of interest for such HNA 
Designee in the good faith opinion of the applicable committee.

2.4    Qualification of HNA Designees.

(a) Each HNA Designee shall, at the time of his or her nomination or 
appointment as a Director and at all times thereafter until such individual 
ceases to serve as a Director:

(i) meet and comply with any and all policies, procedures, processes, 
codes, rules, standards and guidelines of the Company applicable to all 
non-employee Board members, including the Companys code of business 
conduct and ethics, securities trading policies and corporate governance 
guidelines;

(ii) not be involved in any of the events enumerated in Item 2(d) or Item 
2(e) of Schedule 13D under the Exchange Act or Item 401(f) of Regulation 
S-K under the Securities Act;

(iii) not be subject to any order, decree or judgment of any Governmental 
Authority prohibiting service as a director of any public company;

(iv) not be an employee, officer, or director of, or consultant to, or be 
receiving any compensation or benefits from, any Restricted Entity (unless 
otherwise agreed to by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee);

(v) not have been an employee, director, or officer of, or consultant to, 
any HNA Hospitality Business, received compensation from any HNA 
Hospitality Business, or have had any direct management oversight of any 
HNA Hospitality Business, within the two (2) year period prior to his or 
her nomination or appointment as Director (unless otherwise agreed to by 
the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee); and

(vi) if such HNA Designee is an Independent HNA Designee, meets the 
criteria set forth in the definition of Independent HNA Designee in 
Article I (the requirements set forth in this Section 2.4(a), Section 
2.4(b) and Section 2.4(c) being referred to, collectively, as the 
Designee Qualifications).

(b) As a condition to an HNA Designees election or nomination for election 
and any subsequent nomination for election as a Director, such HNA Designee 
shall have executed and delivered to the Company a Director Confidentiality 
Agreement.

(c) Each HNA Designee, as a condition to his or her initial appointment or 
election to the Board and any re-nomination for election to the Board, must 
be willing to be interviewed by the Nominating and Corporate Governance 
Committee on the same basis as any other new candidate for appointment or 
election to the Board and must be reasonably
 
12

------------------------------------------------------------------------
satisfactory to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee acting in 
good faith. HNA, in its capacity as a stockholder of the Company on behalf 
of itself and other HNA Entities, and each HNA Designee, shall deliver such 
questionnaires and otherwise provide such information as are reasonably 
requested by the Company in connection with assessing qualification, 
independence and other criteria applicable to Directors, or required to be 
or customarily provided by directors, candidates for director, and their 
Affiliates and representatives for inclusion in a proxy statement or other 
filing required by applicable Law and the rules of the Exchange, in each 
case to substantially the same extent requested or required of other 
candidates for appointment or election to the Board after the date hereof.

2.5    Service on Specified Boards. The HNA Designator shall not designate 
any individual pursuant to Section 2.1 who, at the time of such 
designation, is a member or has been nominated to serve as a member of a 
Specified Board. If an HNA Designee becomes a member of a Specified Board, 
the HNA Designator shall use its best efforts to cause such HNA Designee to 
promptly tender to the Board his or her resignation as a Director.

2.6    Participation of HNA Designees in Certain Matters; Acquisition 
Proposals.

(a) The Company shall promptly provide HNA with written notice (an 
Acquisition Notice) of any written bona fide Acquisition Proposal that is 
received by or presented to the Board, and such Acquisition Notice need not 
specify the identity of the potential acquirer or any other terms of such 
Acquisition Proposal. From delivery of an Acquisition Notice to HNA until 
HNA delivers an HNA Standstill Commitment to the Company or the expiration 
of the ten (10) Business Day period contemplated by Section 2.6(b), the 
Company shall provide HNA with prior written notice of any meeting of the 
Board (or a committee thereof) scheduled to discuss, consider or vote upon 
such Acquisition Proposal at least twenty-four (24) hours before such 
meeting is convened.

(b) If (i) an Acquisition Notice has been delivered to HNA and, within ten 
(10) Business Days thereafter, an HNA Standstill Commitment is delivered to 
the Company, and (ii) any Acquisition Proposal previously made by an HNA 
Entity has been withdrawn, then the Affiliated HNA Designee shall be 
entitled, after but not before such HNA Standstill Commitment has been 
delivered to the Company, to participate in all discussions, consideration 
and voting by the Board regarding, and shall be entitled to receive any 
materials provided to the Board relating to, the Acquisition Proposal 
described in such Acquisition Notice, revisions to such Acquisition 
Proposal and any other Acquisition Proposal solicited by or on behalf of 
the Board in connection with the consideration of such Acquisition Proposal 
or made by a third party in response to such Acquisition Proposal 
(collectively, the Related Acquisition Proposals). If an HNA Standstill 
Commitment is not delivered to the Company within such ten (10) Business 
Day period, the Affiliated HNA Designee shall not be entitled to 
participate in any discussions, consideration or voting by the Board 
regarding, and shall not be entitled to receive any materials provided to 
the Board relating to, any such Acquisition Proposal or the Related 
Acquisition Proposals.
 
13

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 2.6(b), the 
Affiliated HNA Designee shall not be entitled to participate in any 
discussions, consideration or voting by the Board regarding, and shall not 
be entitled to receive any Board (or committee) materials relating to, any 
transaction or matter that, in the good faith determination of the Board 
(other than the Affiliated HNA Designee), presents an actual or potential 
conflict of interest for such Affiliated HNA Designee, including, without 
limitation, any Acquisition Proposal involving an HNA Entity.

(d) Each Independent HNA Designee shall be permitted to participate in all 
discussions, consideration and voting by the Board regarding, and shall be 
entitled to receive any Board materials relating to, any Acquisition 
Proposal, except when such attendance or receipt of materials would present 
an actual or potential conflict of interest for such Independent HNA 
Designee in the good faith determination of the Board (other than the 
Affiliated HNA Designee and such Independent HNA Designee).

(e) If the Board establishes a committee of the Board to consider any 
Acquisition Proposal, one (1) HNA Designee, as determined by the HNA 
Designator, shall be entitled to be a member of such committee; provided, 
that such HNA Designee may be the Affiliated HNA Designee only if (i) an 
HNA Standstill Commitment has been delivered by HNA to the Company in 
accordance with Section 2.6(b), and (ii) any Acquisition Proposal 
previously made by an HNA Entity has been withdrawn.

2.7    Resignations. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this 
Agreement:

(a) if, at any time, the HNA Entities, in the aggregate, Beneficially Own 
at least fifteen percent (15%) but less than twenty percent (20%) of the 
total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding and there are then more 
than two (2) HNA Designees on the Board, if requested by the Nominating and 
Corporate Governance Committee, the HNA Designator shall use its best 
efforts to cause one (1) or more HNA Designees selected by it to promptly 
tender his or her resignation from the Board and any applicable committee 
of the Board such that there are not more than two (2) HNA Designees 
serving on the Board;

(b) if, at any time, the HNA Entities, in the aggregate, Beneficially Own 
at least five percent (5%) but less than fifteen percent (15%) of the total 
number of shares of Common Stock outstanding, if requested by the 
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, the HNA Designator shall use 
its best efforts to cause one (1) or more HNA Designees to promptly tender 
his or her resignation from the Board and any applicable committee of the 
Board such that there is not more than one (1) HNA Designee serving on the 
Board; and

(c) if, at any time, the HNA Entities, in the aggregate, Beneficially Own 
less than five percent (5%) of the total number of shares of Common Stock 
outstanding, if requested by the Nominating and Corporate Governance 
Committee, the HNA Designator shall use its best efforts to cause each HNA 
Designee to promptly tender his or her resignation from the Board and any 
applicable committee of the Board such that there are no HNA Designees 
serving on the Board;
 
14

------------------------------------------------------------------------
provided, however, that notwithstanding Section 2.1 and the foregoing 
provisions of this Section 2.7, if the closing of an issuance of Equity 
Securities of the Company or a Stock Acquisition causes the HNA Entities 
Beneficial Ownership of shares of Common Stock, as a percentage of the 
total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding, to decline below a 
percentage specified in this Section 2.7 such that the HNA Designator would 
be required by this Section 2.7 to use its best efforts to cause any HNA 
Designee to promptly tender his or her resignation from the Board, then (A) 
the HNA Designator shall not be required to use its best efforts to cause 
such HNA Designee to promptly tender his or her resignation from the Board, 
and (B) the Company and the Board shall not seek or take any action to 
remove such HNA Designee from the Board, in each case unless in the twelve 
(12) month period following the date of the closing of such issuance of 
Equity Securities of the Company or Stock Acquisition, as the case may be, 
the HNA Entities have not made purchases of Common Stock in open market 
transactions, as permitted by Section 4.3(c), such that the HNA Entities 
Beneficial Ownership of shares of Common Stock, as a percentage of the 
total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding, exceeds the applicable 
percentage specified in this Section 2.7; provided, further, that if the 
Company has imposed any blackout period or periods that restrict the HNA 
Entities ability to purchase shares of Common Stock for more than sixty 
(60) days in the aggregate during such twelve (12) month period, such 
twelve (12) month period shall be extended by the number of days of such 
blackout period or periods in excess of sixty (60) days. If the HNA 
Designator is required to use its best efforts to cause an HNA Designee to 
tender his or her resignation from the Board and such HNA Designee does not 
promptly tender his or her resignation from the Board, such HNA Designee 
shall not thereafter be entitled to participate as a member of any 
committee of the Board pursuant to this Agreement.

2.8    Other HNA Investments. For the avoidance of doubt, no investment by 
any HNA Entity in any Person, including any Restricted Entity, shall limit 
the rights of the HNA Designator pursuant to this Article II.


ARTICLE III

VOTING MATTERS

3.1    Voting in an Uncontested Election. At any meeting of stockholders of 
the Company involving an Uncontested Election (or if action is taken by 
written consent of stockholders of the Company in lieu of a meeting in 
respect of an Uncontested Election), the HNA Parties shall vote, or cause 
to be voted (including, if applicable, by written consent), all Voting 
Securities Beneficially Owned by HNA Entities, at their sole discretion 
either (i) affirmatively in favor of the election of each Person nominated 
to serve as a Director by the Board or the Nominating and Corporate 
Governance Committee, or (ii) in the same proportion as the Voting 
Securities not Beneficially Owned by HNA Entities are voted (including, if 
applicable, by written consent) affirmatively for, or to withhold authority 
with respect to, the election of each Person nominated to serve as a 
Director by the Board or the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee 
(it being understood that the HNA Parties must elect to vote as 
contemplated by subclause (i) or (ii) of this Section 3.1 and cannot elect 
not to vote or to vote in any other manner).

written consent of stockholders in lieu of a meeting in respect of a 
Contested Election), the HNA Parties shall vote, or cause to be voted 
(including, if applicable, by written consent), all Voting Securities 
Beneficially Owned by HNA Entities in the same proportion as the Voting

3.3    Voting with respect to Certain Acquisitions. At any meeting of 
stockholders of the Company at which an Acquisition (other than a Specified 
Acquisition or an HNA Acquisition) that has been approved and recommended

other related matter the approval of which is required to consummate such 
Acquisition) is submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Company (or 
if action is taken with respect to such matter(s) by written consent of 
stockholders of the Company in lieu of a meeting), the HNA Parties shall 
vote or cause to be voted (including by abstaining or, if applicable, 
taking action by written consent) all Voting Securities Beneficially Owned

proportion as the Voting Securities not Beneficially Owned by HNA Entities 
are voted (including by written consent) for or against, or abstain with 
respect to, such Acquisition (and such related matter(s)). Solely for 
purposes of this Section 3.3, in determining the proportion in which Voting 
Securities not Beneficially Owned by HNA Entities are voted with respect to 
an Acquisition or related matter to which this Section 3.3 applies, fifty 
percent (50%) of all Non-Votes (as defined in the following sentence) shall 
be taken into account as votes against such Acquisition or related matter 
and fifty percent (50%) of all Non-Votes shall not be taken into account in 
such determination. Non-Votes, with respect to an Acquisition or related 
matter to which this Section 3.3 applies, means all broker non-votes and 
all Voting Securities that are not present or represented at the applicable 
stockholder meeting (or, if applicable, written consent) or are not voted 
for or against, or abstain with respect to, such Acquisition or related 
matter. The HNA Parties shall be free to vote or cause to be voted 
(including by abstaining or, if applicable, taking action by written 
consent), in their sole discretion, all Voting Securities Beneficially 
Owned by HNA Entities up to and including the Voting Percentage Limit for 
or against, or to abstain from voting on, any Acquisition (and any related

Beneficially Owned by HNA Entities at any meeting of stockholders of the 
Company at which a Specified Acquisition or an HNA Acquisition is submitted 
to a vote of the stockholders of the Company (or, if applicable, any action 
taken by written consent of the stockholders of the Company in lieu of a 
meeting) and the HNA Parties shall be free to vote (including by written 
consent), at their sole discretion, all Voting Securities Beneficially 
Owned by HNA Entities against any Specified Acquisition and for any HNA

of the Company at which any matter, other than an Other Specified Matter or 
a matter that is subject to Section 3.1, Section 3.2 or Section 3.3, is 
submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Company (or if action is

meeting), the HNA Parties shall vote or cause to be voted (including by 
abstaining or, if applicable, taking action by written consent) all Voting 
Securities Beneficially Owned by HNA Entities in excess of the Voting

and including the Voting Percentage Limit for or against, or to abstain 
from voting on, each such matter.

ARTICLE IV

ADDITIONAL COVENANTS

4.1    Certain Transfers.

(a) HNA Permitted Transferee. If an HNA Party Transfers any shares of 
Common Stock to any HNA Entity that is not an HNA Party (any such HNA 
Entity, an HNA Permitted Transferee), such HNA Permitted Transferee 
shall, as a condition of such Transfer, agree in writing to be bound to the 
same extent as HNA by the obligations of this Agreement by executing a 
joinder agreement substantially in the form attached as Exhibit B to this 
Agreement.

(b) Pledges. Following any Transfer by an HNA Party in connection with any 
bona fide mortgage, encumbrance or pledge to a financial institution in

thereunder, HNA shall (i) promptly notify the Company in writing upon 
receipt of any notice of acceleration or foreclosure from a financial

directly on the books and records of the transfer agent in the name of the 
applicable HNA Party and maintained in the form of book entries or (y) 
while any such shares of Common Stock are subject to any mortgage, 
encumbrance or pledge to a financial institution as described in Section 
4.1(b) above, registered in the name of The Depository Trust Company or its 
nominee maintained in the form of book entries on the books of The 
Depository Trust Company, and allowed to be settled through The Depository 
Trust Companys regular book entry settlement services free of restrictive 
legends, stop transfer limitations and/or other notations. Without limiting 
the generality of the foregoing, any shares of Common Stock that cease to 
be subject to any mortgage, encumbrance or pledge to a financial 
institution shall be registered directly on the books and records of the 
transfer agent in the name of the applicable HNA Party. Any certificates 
for shares of Common Stock held by an HNA Party as of the Effective Date 
that are not subject to any mortgage, encumbrance or pledge to a financial 
institution shall bear a legend

Party, (A) in connection with any Transfer of Common Stock Transferred in 
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Company shall promptly 
cause the legend (or notation) referred to in clause (ii) above to be 
removed upon such Transfer if such restrictions would not be applicable 
following such Transfer, (B) following receipt by the Company of an opinion 
of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Company to the effect that the 
legend (or notation) referred to in clause (i) above is no longer required 
under the Securities Act and applicable state securities Laws, the Company 
shall promptly cause such legend (or notation) to be removed from any 
Common Stock to be Transferred in accordance with the terms of this 
Agreement, and (C) to the extent such legends (or notations) would be 
removed pursuant to this paragraph in connection with any Transfer of 
Common Stock, the Company shall use reasonable efforts to cause such Common 
Stock to be registered in the name of The Depository Trust Companys 
nominee; provided, however, that any Transfer effected by a financial 
institution pursuant to any mortgage, encumbrance or pledge with respect to 
Common Stock shall be governed by the terms of any applicable Issuer 
Agreement among the Company, the applicable financial institution and any 
custodian party thereto in substantially the form attached hereto as 
Exhibit E.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.2    Right of First Refusal.

(a) If the Company, at any time or from time to time following the 
Effective Date, proposes to issue (a New Issuance) any New Securities, 
for cash in an offering that is not an underwritten public offering or an 
offering pursuant to Rule 144A (or a successor rule) under the Securities 
Act (any such offering, a Private Placement), the Company shall provide 
HNA with written notice (an Issuance Notice) of such New Issuance at 
least ten (10) Business Days prior to the issuance of such New Securities. 
The Issuance Notice shall set forth the material terms and conditions of 
the New Issuance, including (i) the proposed number of New Securities if 
known or, if not known, an estimate thereof, (ii) a description of the New 
Securities and proposed manner of sale, (iii) the purchase price per New 
Security (or conversion price or premium in the event of an offering of 
convertible debt) (the Per Security Offering Price) if known or, if not 
known, an estimate thereof, and (iv) the proposed issuance date if known 
or, if not known, an estimate thereof. HNA shall be entitled to purchase 
(either directly or through any other HNA Parties or any of HNAs 
Controlled Affiliates that are HNA Permitted Transferees), at the Per 
Security Offering Price and on the other terms and conditions specified in 
the Issuance Notice, up to the number of such New Securities that would 
result in the percentage of the total number of outstanding shares of 
Common Stock that is Beneficially Owned in the aggregate by all HNA 
Entities immediately following such New Issuance being equal to the 
percentage of the total number of outstanding shares of Common Stock that 
was Beneficially Owned in the aggregate by all HNA Entities immediately 
prior to such New Issuance; provided, that for this purpose such percentage 
shall not exceed twenty-five percent (25%) (such percentage, the Pro Rata 
Portion). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the number of New Securities that 
HNA (directly or through any other HNA Parties or their Controlled 
Affiliates that are HNA Permitted Transferees) shall be entitled to 
purchase pursuant to this Section 4.2 with respect to any New Issuance 
shall be limited to the maximum amount that may be issued by the Company to 
HNA (directly or through any other HNA Parties or their Controlled 
Affiliates that are HNA Permitted Transferees) without requiring approval 
of such issuance by the stockholders of the Company under the rules of the 
Exchange, as determined in good faith by the Company (which such 
determination shall be binding on the parties).

(b) HNA may exercise its rights under this Section 4.2 by delivering 
written notice of its election to purchase (either directly or through any 
other HNA Parties or any of HNAs Controlled Affiliates that are HNA 
Permitted Transferees) such New Securities to the Company within five (5) 
Business Days after receipt of the Issuance Notice, which notice shall 
specify the number of New Securities requested to be purchased by HNA. 
Delivery of such notice shall constitute a binding commitment of HNA to 
purchase (either directly or through any other HNA Parties or any of HNAs 
Controlled Affiliates that are HNA Permitted Transferees) the amount of New 
Securities so specified at the Per Security Offering Price and on the terms 
and conditions specified in the Issuance Notice. If, at the termination of 
such five (5) Business Day period, HNA has not exercised its right to 
purchase any such New Securities, HNA shall be deemed to have waived its 
rights under this Section 4.2 with respect to, and only with respect to, 
the purchase of the New Securities specified in the applicable Issuance 
Notice.

(c) The closing of any sale of New Securities to HNA, any other HNA Parties 
or any of HNAs Controlled Affiliates that are HNA Permitted Transferees 
pursuant to this Section 4.2 shall take place concurrently with the 
consummation of the sale of the New Securities on the terms set forth in 
the Issuance Notice to all other Persons purchasing such New Securities 
(the New Issuance Closing).
 
19

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(d) If the Company issues, at the New Issuance Closing, less than all of 
the New Securities described in the Issuance Notice, then the number of New 
Securities that HNA (and any other HNA Parties and any of HNAs Controlled 
Affiliates that are HNA Permitted Transferees) shall be entitled to 
purchase in connection with such New Issuance pursuant to this Section 4.2 
shall be reduced proportionately and HNAs notice delivered pursuant to 
Section 4.2(b) shall be deemed amended to reflect such reduction. If the 
number of New Securities is reduced as contemplated by this Section 4.2(d), 
the Company shall not issue or sell the remainder of the New Securities 
described in the Issuance Notice without again complying with the 
provisions of this Section 4.2.

(e) If the New Issuance Closing (other than any over-allotment closing) 
does not occur within ninety (90) days after the date of the Issuance 
Notice, the Company shall not issue or sell the New Securities described in 
the Issuance Notice without again complying with the provisions of this 
Section 4.2.

(f) HNA (or any other HNA Parties or any of HNAs Controlled Affiliates 
that are HNA Permitted Transferees) shall, prior to the closing of any 
Private Placement in which any of them has elected to purchase New 
Securities pursuant to this Section 4.2, execute and deliver all such 
documents and instruments as are customarily required in connection with 
such an offering, including, without limitation, customary investment 
representations and representations as to its status as the type of offeree 
to whom a private sale may be made pursuant to the Securities Act, and any 
failure to deliver or enter into any such documents and instruments at or 
prior to such closing shall constitute a waiver of the right of first 
refusal set forth in this Section 4.2 with respect to such New Issuance.

4.3    Standstill.

(a) Subject to Section 4.3(b) and Section 4.3(c), on and after the 
Effective Date, HNA Group and the HNA Parties shall not, shall cause their 
respective Affiliates not to, and shall cause the representatives of HNA 
Group, the HNA Parties and their respective Affiliates acting at their 
direction not to, in any manner, directly or indirectly, to, without the 
prior written consent of, or waiver by, the Company:

(i) acquire, offer to acquire or agree to acquire, by purchase or 
otherwise, Beneficial Ownership of any Equity Securities of the Company 
(including any rights, options or other derivative securities or contracts 
or instruments to acquire such ownership that derives its value (in whole 
or in part) from such Equity Securities (whether currently, upon lapse of 
time, following the satisfaction of any conditions, upon the occurrence of 
any event or any combinations of the foregoing)) other than: (A) as a 
result of any stock split, stock dividend or distribution, subdivision, 
reorganization, reclassification or similar capital transaction involving 
Equity Securities of the Company; (B) discussions or negotiations to 
acquire a beneficial interest in any Equity Securities of the Company from 
Blackstone or any of its Affiliates, provided, that HNA Group, any HNA 
Party or any of their respective Affiliates, as applicable, has, prior to 
initiating such discussions or negotiations, notified the Board in writing 
of its intention to initiate
 
20

------------------------------------------------------------------------
such discussions or negotiations; provided further that, for the avoidance 
of doubt, none of HNA Group, the HNA Parties or any of their respective 
Affiliates shall, directly or indirectly, acquire a beneficial interest in 
any Equity Securities of the Company from Blackstone or any of its 
Affiliates without the prior written consent of the Company, (C) pursuant 
to Section 4.1(a), Section 4.2 or Section 4.3(c) or (D) a Transfer between 
HNA Parties; provided, that no HNA Party shall be in breach of this Section 
4.3(a)(i) as a result of the acquisition by any HNA Designee of any Equity 
Securities of the Company pursuant to (x) the grant or vesting of any 
equity compensation awards granted by the Company to any HNA Designee, or 
(y) the exercise of any stock options, restricted stock units, or similar 
awards relating to any Equity Securities of the Company granted by the 
Company to any HNA Designee;

(ii) make any public announcement or public offer with respect to any 
merger, business combination, recapitalization, reorganization or other 
similar extraordinary transaction involving the Company or any of its 
Subsidiaries (unless such transaction is approved or affirmatively 
recommended by the Board);

(iii) make, knowingly encourage or in any way participate in, any 
solicitation of proxies (as such terms are used in the proxy rules of 
the SEC promulgated pursuant to Section 14 of the Exchange Act) to vote any 
Voting Securities, or seek to advise or influence any Person with respect 
to the voting of, any Voting Securities (other than, in each case, in a 
manner that is not inconsistent with the Boards recommendation in 
connection with a matter);

(iv) seek election to, or seek to place a representative on, the Board or 
removal of any member of the Board or otherwise act, alone or in concert 
with others, to seek representation or to control or influence the 
management, the Board or policies of the Company (other than (A) with 
respect to the election or removal of an HNA Designee or (B) to vote in 
accordance with the requirements of Article III);

(v) call, or seek to call, a meeting of the stockholders of the Company or 
initiate any stockholder proposal for action by stockholders of the 
Company;

(vi) form, join or in any way participate in a Group with respect to Equity 
Securities (other than a Group consisting solely of HNA Parties);

(vii) otherwise act, alone or in concert with others, to seek to control or 
influence the management or the policies of the Company (for the avoidance 
of doubt, excluding any such act in their capacity as a commercial 
counterparty, customer, supplier, industry participant or the like);

(viii) advise or knowingly assist or encourage or enter into any 
discussions, negotiations, agreements or arrangements with any other 
Persons in connection with any of the foregoing activities;

(ix) publicly disclose any intention, plan or arrangement inconsistent with 
any of the foregoing activities;
 
21

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(x) arrange, or in any way provide, directly or indirectly, any financing 
for the purchase by any Person or Group of any Equity Securities or assets 
of the Company, other than financing for (A) the purchase of assets then 
being offered for sale by the Company, (B) the Transfer of any shares of 
Common Stock to an HNA Party or an HNA Permitted Transferee, (C) purchases 
of any Equity Securities of the Company by an HNA Entity that are permitted 
by this Agreement and (D) an HNA Acquisition.

(xi) take any action that HNA Group or an HNA Party knows, or would 
reasonably be expected to know, would require the Company to make a public 
announcement regarding the possibility of an Acquisition; or

(xii) contest the validity of this Section 4.3(a) or initiate or 
participate in any judicial proceeding to amend, waive, terminate or seek a 
release of the restrictions contained herein,

it being understood and agreed that (A) without prejudice to Section 2.6, 
this Section 4.3 shall not limit (x) the activities of any HNA Designee 
taken in good faith in his or her capacity as a Director or (y) the 
participation of any HNA Designee in any Board (or committee of the Board, 
as applicable) discussions, deliberations, negotiations or determinations, 
and (B) HNA and HNA Group shall be responsible for any breach of this 
Section 4.3 caused by any action taken by any HNA Entity or by a 
representative of an HNA Entity acting at the direction of any HNA Entity.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 4.3(a), on and 
after the date hereof, other than during any Standstill Commitment Period, 
no HNA Party shall be prohibited or restricted from: (i) initiating and 
engaging in private discussions with, and/or making and submitting to, the 
Company and/or the Board a non-public, confidential Acquisition Proposal so 
long as such HNA Party does not know, and would not be reasonably expected 
to know, that such actions would be reasonably likely to require HNA, the 
Company or any other Person to make a public announcement regarding such 
Acquisition Proposal; or (ii) from and after a public announcement of a 
definitive agreement with respect to an Acquisition entered into between 
the Company and any Person other than an HNA Entity and until the earlier 
of (A) the closing of such Acquisition and (B) ninety (90) days after the 
termination of such definitive agreement, notwithstanding any HNA 
Standstill Commitment or anything to the contrary in this Agreement, making 
and submitting to the Company, the Board, and/or the Companys 
stockholders, an alternative Acquisition Proposal on a publicly disclosed 
and announced basis for all outstanding shares of Common Stock, which, if a 
tender or exchange offer, shall be on the same terms for all such shares 
and include a non-waivable condition that a majority of outstanding shares 
of Common Stock not Beneficially Owned by any HNA Entity are tendered into 
such offer, or (subject to Sections 3.3, 4.3(a)(i) and 4.7) taking any 
other action, whether or not otherwise restricted by Section 4.3(a) in 
connection with evaluating, making, submitting, negotiating, effectuating 
or implementing any such alternative Acquisition Proposal (or any 
amendment, supplement or modification thereto), including actively 
soliciting stockholders of the Company not to vote in favor of or to vote 
against such Acquisition by a Person other than an HNA Entity.
 
22

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 4.3(a), HNA may 
(directly or through any other HNA Parties or any of their respective 
Controlled Affiliates that are HNA Permitted Transferees), at any time and 
from time to time, purchase shares of Common Stock in open market 
transactions in an amount that, when aggregated with the number of shares 
of Common Stock then Beneficially Owned by all HNA Entities, would not then 
exceed a percentage of the shares of Common Stock outstanding at such time 
equal to the lower of (i) twenty-five percent (25%) and (ii) the Adjusted 
Ownership Percentage (as defined in the following sentence). The Adjusted 
Ownership Percentage shall initially be equal to twenty-five (25%) and, 
upon each Transfer of shares of Common Stock by an HNA Entity that (A) is 
to a Person other than another HNA Entity and (B) occurs when the 
percentage of the total number of outstanding shares of Common Stock that 
is Beneficially Owned, in the aggregate, by all HNA Entities is less than 
or equal to twenty-five (25%) or causes such percentage to be less than 
twenty-five (25%), shall be reduced to equal the percentage of the total 
number of outstanding shares of Common Stock that is Beneficially Owned, in 
the aggregate, by all HNA Entities immediately following such Transfer. For 
purposes of this Section 4.3(c), the total number of shares of Common Stock 
outstanding at any time shall be the number specified in the latest of (i) 
the most recent SEC filing of the Company disclosing the total number of 
shares of Common Stock outstanding or (ii) a written notice from the 
Company, which will be provided to HNA as soon as reasonably practicable 
upon a written request therefor from HNA following any New Issuance or 
Stock Acquisition.

4.4    Corporate Opportunities; Section 203. On the Effective Date, the 
Company shall amend its certificate of incorporation as set forth in 
Exhibit D to this Agreement.

4.5    Issuer Agreement. At the Closing, the Company shall duly execute and 
deliver to HNA the issuer agreement substantially in the form attached as 
Exhibit E to this Agreement.

4.6    Cooperation. Following the Effective Date, the Company and HNA 
shall, from time to time, engage in good faith discussions regarding 
strategic cooperation that may be mutually beneficial to such parties.

4.7    Tender of Shares in Certain Acquisitions. If, at any time when (i) 
HNA Entities Beneficially Own Voting Securities in excess of the Voting 
Percentage Limit, and (ii) any Acquisition (other than a Specified 
Acquisition) by a Person other than an HNA Entity is to be effected by 
means of a tender or exchange offer that has been approved and recommended 
(and such recommendation has not been withdrawn) by the Board, the HNA 
Parties shall tender into such offer, prior to any expiration thereof (as 
such offer may be extended from time to time), all the shares of Common 
Stock Beneficially Owned by HNA Entities in excess of the Voting Percentage 
Limit in the same proportion as the shares of Common Stock not Beneficially 
Owned by HNA Entities are so tendered. Such tender by the HNA Parties shall 
be made within twelve (12) hours of notification from any depositary for 
such tender or exchange offer of the percentage of Voting Securities 
Beneficially Owned by holders other than HNA Entities then received by such 
depositary. The HNA Parties shall be free, in their sole discretion, to 
tender or not tender into such offer, any and all shares of Common Stock 
Beneficially Owned by HNA Entities up to and including the Voting 
Percentage Limit.
 
23

------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.8    Public Announcements. The initial press release with respect to this 
Agreement shall be a joint press release to be reasonably agreed upon by 
HNA and the Company. Thereafter, HNA and the Company shall consult with 
each other before issuing any press release, or other public announcement 
with respect to this Agreement or the matters contemplated hereby and, 
except in respect of any such press release or other public announcement as 
may be required by applicable Law or any applicable rule of any securities 
exchange or association, shall not issue any such press release or other 
public announcement prior to such consultation.

6.3    Amendment; Waiver. This Agreement may be amended, supplemented or 
otherwise modified, and the observance of any term hereof may be waived, 
only by a written instrument executed by (i) the Company and (ii) the HNA 
Designator. Neither the failure nor delay on the part of any party hereto 
to exercise any right, remedy, power or privilege under this Agreement 
shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise 
of any right, remedy, power or privilege preclude any other or further 
exercise of the same or of any other right, remedy, power or privilege, nor 
shall any waiver of any right, remedy, power or privilege with respect to 
any occurrence be construed as a waiver of such right, remedy, power or 
privilege with respect to any other occurrence. No waiver shall be 
effective unless it is in writing and is signed by the party asserted to 
have granted such waiver. Any amendment, supplement or modification to this 
Agreement and any waiver of any term hereof effected in accordance with 
this Section 6.3 shall be binding on each party hereto and all of such 
partys successors and permitted assigns, whether or not such party, 
successor or permitted assign entered into or approved such amendment, 
supplement or modification.

6.4    Further Assurances. Each party hereto shall sign such further 
documents and do and perform and cause to be done such further acts and 
things as any other party hereto may reasonably request to the extent 
necessary to carry out the intent and accomplish the purposes of this 
Agreement.

6.5    Assignment. This Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be 
binding on the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted 
assigns. This Agreement may not be assigned, except by any HNA Party to any 
HNA Permitted Transferee that has executed a joinder agreement 
substantially in the form attached as Exhibit B to this Agreement, without 
the express prior written consent of the other parties hereto, and any 
attempted assignment, without such consent, will be null and void.

6.6    Third Parties. This Agreement does not create any rights, claims or 
benefits inuring to any person that is not a party hereto nor create or 
establish any third party beneficiary hereto.

6.7    Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in 
accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to 
principles of conflicts of Laws thereof.

6.8    Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial. In any judicial proceeding 
involving any dispute, controversy or claim between the parties hereto 
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, each of the parties hereto, 
by execution and delivery of this Agreement, unconditionally accepts and 
consents to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the Delaware Court of 
Chancery and any state appellate court to which orders and judgments 
thereof may be appealed within the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware 
Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, 
any state or federal court within the State of Delaware), including but not 
limited to the in personam and subject matter jurisdiction of those courts, 
or if
 
27

------------------------------------------------------------------------
jurisdiction over the matter is vested exclusively in federal courts, the 
United States District Court for the District of Delaware, and the 
appellate courts to which orders and judgments thereof may be appealed,
