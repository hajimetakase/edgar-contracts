Agreement in respect of that currency shall be inconsistent with any 
convention or practice in the London interbank market for the basis of 
accrual of interest in respect of the Euro, such expressed basis shall be 
replaced by such convention or practice with effect from the date on which 
such member state adopts the Euro as its lawful currency; provided that if 
any Borrowing in the currency of such member state is outstanding 
immediately prior to such date, such replacement shall take effect, with 
respect to such Borrowing, at the end of the then current Interest Period.

(b) Without prejudice and in addition to any method of conversion or 
rounding prescribed by any EMU Legislation and (i) without limiting the 
liability of the Borrowers for any amount due under this Agreement and (ii) 
without increasing any commitment of any Lender, all references in this 
Agreement to minimum amounts (or integral multiples thereof) denominated in 
the national currency unit of any member state of the European Union that 
adopts the Euro as its lawful currency after the date hereof shall, 
immediately upon such adoption, be replaced by references to such minimum 
amounts (or integral multiples thereof) as shall be specified herein with 
respect to Borrowings denominated in Euro.

(c) Each provision of this Agreement shall be subject to such reasonable 
changes of construction as the Administrative Agent may from time to time 
specify to be appropriate to reflect the adoption of the Euro by any member 
state of the European Union and any relevant market conventions or 
practices relating to the Euro.

1.6 Interest Rates. If at any time any interest rate quoted or otherwise 
made available from time to time under this Agreement in respect of any 
Currency is no longer available generally, as determined by the 
Administrative Agent, then the Administrative Agent (after consultation 
with, and consent from, Crawford) may, by written notice to the Lenders and
 
42

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Crawford, substitute such unavailable interest rate with another published 
interest rate that adequately reflects the all-in-cost of funds denominated 
in such Currency to the Administrative Agent. Notwithstanding anything to 
the contrary herein, if any determination of any rate described in the 
definitions of Federal Funds Effective Rate or LIBOR Rate would result 
in a rate less than zero, then such rate shall be deemed to be zero.

1.7 Excluded Swap Obligations. Notwithstanding any term or provision of any 
Credit Document to the contrary, the defined terms Obligations, U.S. 
Obligations, Foreign Subsidiary Obligations, Secured Obligations, or 
Guaranteed Obligations shall exclude, with respect to any Credit Party, 
Excluded Swap Obligations of such Credit Party.

1.8 Letter of Credit Amounts. Unless otherwise specified herein, the amount 
of a Letter of Credit at any time shall be deemed to be the Dollar Amount 
of the Stated Amount of such Letter of Credit in effect at such time; 
provided, however, that with respect to any Letter of Credit that, by its 
terms or the terms of any Issuer Document related thereto, provides for one 
or more automatic increases in the stated amount thereof, the amount of 
such Letter of Credit shall be deemed to be the Dollar Amount of the 
maximum stated amount of such Letter of Credit after giving effect to all 
such increases, whether or not such maximum stated amount is in effect at 
such time; provided that the amount of any such Letter of Credit, for 
purposes of determining Consolidated Total Funded Debt at any time, shall 
only include such increases to the extent in effect at such time. For all 
purposes of this Agreement, if on any date a Letter of Credit has expired 
by its terms but any amount may still be drawn thereunder by reason of the 
operation of Rule 3.14 of the ISP, such Letter of Credit shall be deemed to 
be outstanding hereunder in the amount so remaining available to be 
drawn.


ARTICLE II

AMOUNT AND TERMS OF CREDIT

2.1 Commitments.

(a) Each Lender severally agrees, subject to and on the terms and 
conditions of this Agreement, to make loans (each, a Revolving Loan, and 
collectively, the Revolving Loans) in Dollars or any Foreign Currency to 
any Borrower, from time to time on any Business Day during the period from 
and including the Closing Date to but not including the Termination Date, 
in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not exceeding its 
Commitment; provided that no Borrowing of Revolving Loans shall be made if, 
immediately after giving effect thereto (and to any concurrent repayment of 
Swingline Loans with proceeds of Revolving Loans made pursuant to such 
Borrowing), (x) the Credit Extended to such Borrower would exceed such 
Borrowers Sublimit, (y) the Credit Exposure of any Lender would exceed its 
Commitment at such time or (z) the Aggregate Credit Exposure would exceed 
the aggregate Commitments at such time. Subject to and on the terms and 
conditions of this Agreement, the Borrowers may borrow, repay and re-borrow 
Revolving Loans.

(b) The Swingline Lender agrees, subject to and on the terms and conditions 
of this Agreement, to make loans (each, a Swingline Loan, and 
collectively, the Swingline Loans) to any Borrower, from time to time on 
any Business Day during the period from the Closing
 
43

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date to but not including the Swingline Maturity Date (or, if earlier, the 
Termination Date), in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding 
not exceeding the Swingline Commitment. Swingline Loans may be made even if 
the aggregate principal amount of Swingline Loans outstanding at any time, 
when added to the aggregate principal amount of the Revolving Loans made by 
the Swingline Lender in its capacity as a Lender outstanding at such time 
and its L/C Exposure at such time, would exceed the Swingline Lenders own 
Commitment at such time; provided, however, that no Borrowing of Swingline 
Loans shall be made if, immediately after giving effect thereto, (w) the 
Credit Extended to such Borrower would exceed such Borrowers Sublimit, (x) 
the aggregate principal amount of all Swingline Loans then outstanding 
would exceed the Swingline Commitment, (y) the Credit Exposure of any 
Lender would exceed its Commitment at such time or (z) the Aggregate Credit 
Exposure would exceed the aggregate Commitments at such time; provided 
further that the Swingline Lender shall not make any Swingline Loan if any 
Lender is at that time a Defaulting Lender, unless the Swingline Lender has 
entered into arrangements, including the delivery of Cash Collateral, 
satisfactory to the Swingline Lender (in its sole discretion) with the 
applicable Borrower or such Lender to eliminate the Swingline Lenders 
actual or potential Fronting Exposure (after giving effect to Section 
2.20(a)(iv)) with respect to the Defaulting Lender arising from either the 
Swingline Loan then proposed to be made or such Swingline Loan and all 
other Swingline Loans as to which the Swingline Lender has actual or 
potential Fronting Exposure, as it may elect in its sole discretion. 
Subject to and on the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Borrowers 
may borrow, repay (including by means of a Borrowing of Revolving Loans 
pursuant to Section 2.2(e)) and re-borrow Swingline Loans. All Swingline 
Loans shall be denominated in Dollars and bear interest at the Adjusted 
Base Rate.


2.2 Borrowings.

(a) Each Revolving Loan shall, at the option of the applicable Borrower and 
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, be either a Base 
Rate Loan or a LIBOR Loan (each, a Type of Loan) and shall be denominated 
in a single Currency; provided, however, that all Revolving Loans 
denominated in a Foreign Currency shall be LIBOR Loans at all times; 
provided further that (i) all Loans constituting the same Borrowing shall, 
unless otherwise specifically provided herein, be of the same Type and 
denominated in the same Currency, and (iii) no LIBOR Loans may be borrowed 
at any time prior to the third Business Day after the Closing Date.

(b) In order to make a Borrowing (other than (w) Borrowings of Swingline 
Loans, which shall be made pursuant to Section 2.2(d), (x) Borrowings for 
the purpose of repaying Refunded Swingline Loans, which shall be made 
pursuant to Section 2.2(e), (y) Borrowings for the purpose of paying unpaid 
Reimbursement Obligations, which shall be made pursuant to Section 3.5, and 
(z) Borrowings involving continuations or conversions of outstanding Loans, 
which shall be made pursuant to Section 2.11), Crawford shall give the 
Administrative Agent written notice on behalf of the applicable Borrower 
(and each Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally authorizes 
Crawford to give any such notice from time to time in any form or substance 
as permitted under this Section 2.2) not later than 12:00 p.m., Charlotte 
time, (i) on the day of each Borrowing to comprise Base Rate Loans, (ii) 
three Business Days prior to each Borrowing to comprise LIBOR Loans 
denominated in Dollars or (iii) four Business Days prior to each Borrowing 
to comprise LIBOR Loans denominated in a Foreign Currency; provided,
 
44

------------------------------------------------------------------------
however, that requests for the Borrowing of any Revolving Loans to be made 
on the Closing Date may, at the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be 
given with less advance notice than as specified hereinabove. Each such 
notice (each, a Notice of Borrowing) shall be irrevocable, shall be given 
in the form of Exhibit B-1, shall be signed by an Authorized Officer of 
Crawford and shall specify (1) the Borrower to which the Loans constituting 
such Borrowing will be made, (2) the aggregate principal amount, Currency 
and initial Type of the Loans to be made pursuant to such Borrowing, (3) in 
the case of a Borrowing of LIBOR Loans, the initial Interest Period to be 
applicable thereto, and (4) the requested Borrowing Date, which shall be a 
Business Day. Upon its receipt of a Notice of Borrowing, the Administrative 
Agent shall promptly notify each applicable Lender of the proposed 
Borrowing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein:

(i) if Crawford shall have failed to designate the Borrower to which the 
Loans constituting a Borrowing will be made, then Crawford shall be deemed 
to have requested a Borrowing of Loans made to Crawford;

(ii) except with respect to a Borrowing for the purpose of repaying 
Refunded Swingline Loans or paying Reimbursement Obligations, the Dollar 
Amount of the aggregate principal amount of each Borrowing shall not be 
less than $1,000,000 and, if greater, an integral multiple of $500,000 in 
excess thereof; provided, however, that a Borrowing comprising Base Rate 
Loans may be in an amount equal to the aggregate Commitments less the 
Aggregate Credit Exposure;

(iii) if Crawford shall have failed to designate the Currency of Loans 
constituting a Borrowing, then Crawford shall be deemed to have requested a 
Borrowing comprising Loans denominated in Dollars;

(iv) if Crawford shall have failed to designate the Type of Loans 
constituting a Borrowing of Loans denominated in Dollars, then Crawford 
shall be deemed to have requested a Borrowing comprising of Base Rate 
Loans; and

(v) if Crawford shall have failed to select the duration of the Interest 
Period to be applicable to any Borrowing of LIBOR Loans, then Crawford 
shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period with a duration of one 
month.

(c) Not later than (i) (A) with respect to a Borrowing denominated in 
Japanese Yen, 9:00 a.m., Tokyo time, (B) with respect to a Borrowing 
denominated in Australian Dollars, 9:00 a.m., Sydney time, or (C) with 
respect to a Borrowing denominated in any other Forward Foreign Currency, 
9:00 a.m., local time for the central bank of the issuing jurisdiction of 
such Forward Foreign Currency, (ii) with respect to a Borrowing denominated 
in any other Foreign Currency, 1:00 p.m., London time, or (iii) with 
respect to a Borrowing denominated in Dollars, 2:00 p.m., Charlotte time, 
on the requested Borrowing Date, each applicable Lender shall make 
available to the Administrative Agent in accordance with the applicable 
Payment Instructions an amount, in the applicable Currency and in 
immediately available funds, equal to the amount of the Loan or Loans to be 
made by such Lender. To the extent such Lenders have made such amounts 
available to the Administrative Agent as provided hereinabove, the 
Administrative Agent shall make the aggregate of such amounts available to 
the applicable Borrower not later
 
45

------------------------------------------------------------------------
than 5:30 p.m., London time (for a Borrowing denominated in any Foreign 
Currency), or 5:30 p.m., Charlotte time (for a Borrowing denominated in 
Dollars), in accordance with Section 2.3(a) and in like funds as received 
by the Administrative Agent.

(d) In order to make a Borrowing of a Swingline Loan, Crawford shall give 
the Administrative Agent (and the Swingline Lender, if the Swingline Lender 
is not also the Administrative Agent) written notice on behalf of the 
applicable Borrower (and each Borrower hereby irrevocably and 
unconditionally authorizes Crawford to give any such notice from time to 
time in any form or substance as permitted under this Section 2.2) not 
later than 12:00 p.m., Charlotte time, on the date of such Borrowing. Each 
such notice (each, a Notice of Swingline Borrowing) shall be given in the 
form of Exhibit B-2, shall be irrevocable, shall be signed by an Authorized 
Officer of Crawford and shall specify (i) the Borrower to which the 
Swingline Loan constituting such Borrowing will be made, (ii) the principal 
amount of the Swingline Loan to be made pursuant to such Borrowing (which 
shall not be less than $100,000 and, if greater, shall be in an integral 
multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof (or, if less, in the amount of the 
Unutilized Swingline Commitment)) and (iii) the requested Borrowing Date, 
which shall be a Business Day. Not later than 1:00 p.m., Charlotte time, on 
the requested Borrowing Date, the Swingline Lender shall make available to 
the Administrative Agent in accordance with the applicable Payment 
Instructions an amount, in Dollars and in immediately available funds, 
equal to the amount of the requested Swingline Loan. To the extent the 
Swingline Lender has made such amount available to the Administrative Agent 
as provided hereinabove, the Administrative Agent shall make such amount 
available to the applicable Borrower no later than 2:00 p.m., Charlotte 
time, in accordance with Section 2.3(a) and in like funds as received by 
the Administrative Agent.

(e) With respect to any outstanding Swingline Loans, the Swingline Lender 
may at any time (whether or not an Event of Default has occurred and is 
continuing) in its sole and absolute discretion, and is hereby authorized 
and empowered by Crawford and the applicable Borrower to, cause a Borrowing 
of Revolving Loans by such Borrower to be made for the purpose of repaying 
such Swingline Loans by delivering to the Administrative Agent (if the 
Administrative Agent is not also the Swingline Lender) and each other 
Lender (on behalf of, and with a copy to, Crawford and the applicable 
Borrower), not later than 11:00 a.m., Charlotte time, one Business Day 
prior to the proposed Borrowing Date therefor, a notice (which shall be 
deemed to be a Notice of Borrowing given by Crawford on behalf of the 
applicable Borrower) requesting the Lenders to make Revolving Loans (which 
shall be made initially as Base Rate Loans) on such Borrowing Date in an 
aggregate principal amount equal to the amount of such Swingline Loans (the 
Refunded Swingline Loans). Not later than 1:00 p.m., Charlotte time, on 
the requested Borrowing Date, each Lender (other than the Swingline Lender) 
shall make available to the Administrative Agent in accordance with the 
applicable Payment Instructions an amount, in Dollars and in immediately 
available funds, equal to the amount of the Revolving Loan to be made by 
such Lender. To the extent the Lenders have made such amounts available to 
the Administrative Agent as provided hereinabove, the Administrative Agent 
shall make the aggregate of such amounts available to the Swingline Lender 
in like funds as received by the Administrative Agent, which shall apply 
such amounts in repayment of the Refunded Swingline Loans. Notwithstanding 
any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, on the relevant Borrowing 
Date, the Refunded Swingline Loans (including the Swingline Lenders 
Applicable Percentage thereof, in its capacity as a Lender) shall be deemed 
to be repaid with the proceeds of
 
46

------------------------------------------------------------------------
the Revolving Loans made as provided above (including a Revolving Loan 
deemed to have been made by the Swingline Lender), and such Refunded 
Swingline Loans deemed to be so repaid shall no longer be outstanding as 
Swingline Loans but shall be outstanding as Revolving Loans. If any portion 
of any such amount repaid (or deemed to be repaid) to the Swingline Lender 
shall be recovered by or on behalf of the applicable Borrower from the 
Swingline Lender in any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceeding or 
otherwise, the loss of the amount so recovered shall be shared ratably 
among all the Lenders in the manner contemplated by Section 2.15(b).

(f) If, as a result of any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceeding 
with respect to Crawford or the applicable Borrower, Revolving Loans are 
not made pursuant to Section 2.2(e) in an amount sufficient to repay any 
amounts owed to the Swingline Lender in respect of any outstanding 
Swingline Loans, or if the Swingline Lender is otherwise precluded for any 
reason from giving a notice on behalf of Crawford and the applicable 
Borrower as provided for hereinabove, the Swingline Lender shall be deemed 
to have sold without recourse, representation or warranty (except for the 
absence of Liens thereon created, incurred or suffered to exist by, through 
or under the Swingline Lender), and each Lender shall be deemed to have 
purchased and hereby agrees to purchase, a participation in such 
outstanding Swingline Loans in an amount equal to its Applicable Percentage 
of the unpaid amount thereof together with accrued interest thereon. Upon 
one Business Days prior notice from the Swingline Lender, each Lender 
(other than the Swingline Lender) shall make available to the 
Administrative Agent in accordance with the applicable Payment Instructions 
an amount, in Dollars and in immediately available funds, equal to its 
respective participation. To the extent the Lenders have made such amounts 
available to the Administrative Agent as provided hereinabove, the 
Administrative Agent shall make the aggregate of such amounts available to 
the Swingline Lender in like funds as received by the Administrative Agent. 
In the event any such Lender fails to make available to the Administrative 
Agent the amount of such Lenders participation as provided in this 
Section 2.2(f), the Swingline Lender shall be entitled to recover such 
amount on demand from such Lender, together with interest thereon for each 
day from the date such amount is required to be made available for the 
account of the Swingline Lender until the date such amount is made 
available to the Swingline Lender at the Federal Funds Rate for the first 
three Business Days and thereafter at the Adjusted Base Rate applicable to 
Revolving Loans. Promptly following its receipt of any payment by or on 
behalf of the applicable Borrower in respect of a Swingline Loan, the 
Swingline Lender shall pay to each Lender that has acquired a participation 
therein such Lenders ratable share of such payment.

(g) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the 
obligation of each Lender (other than the Swingline Lender) to make 
Revolving Loans for the purpose of repaying any Refunded Swingline Loans 
pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and each such Lenders obligation to purchase a 
participation in any unpaid Swingline Loans pursuant to Section 2.2(f) 
shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any 
circumstance or event whatsoever, including (i) any setoff, counterclaim, 
recoupment, defense or other right that such Lender may have against the 
Swingline Lender, the Administrative Agent, any Borrower or any other 
Person for any reason whatsoever, (ii) the occurrence or continuance of any 
Default or Event of Default, (iii) the failure of the amount of such 
Borrowing of Revolving Loans to meet any minimum Borrowing amount specified 
in Section 2.2(b), or (iv) the failure of any conditions set forth in 
Section 4.2 or elsewhere herein to be satisfied.
 
47

------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.3 Disbursements; Funding Reliance; Domicile of Loans.

(a) Each Borrower hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to disburse 
the proceeds of each Borrowing in accordance with the terms of any written 
instructions from any Authorized Officer of Crawford or such Borrower; 
provided that the Administrative Agent shall not be obligated under any 
circumstances to forward amounts to any account not listed in an Account 
Designation Letter. Each Borrower may at any time deliver to the 
Administrative Agent an Account Designation Letter listing any additional 
accounts or deleting any accounts listed in a previous Account Designation 
Letter.

(b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a 
Lender (x) in the case of a Borrowing comprising Base Rate Loans, two hours 
prior to the proposed time of such Borrowing, or (y) otherwise, prior to 
the proposed date of any Borrowing, that such Lender will not make 
available to the Administrative Agent such Lenders Applicable Percentage 
of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has 
made its Applicable Percentage of such Borrowing available on such date in 
accordance with Section 2.2 or 3.5, as applicable, and may, in reliance 
upon such assumption, make available to the applicable Borrower a 
corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its 
Applicable Percentage of the applicable Borrowing available to the 
Administrative Agent, then such Lender and the applicable Borrower 
severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such 
corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including 
the date such amount is made available to such Borrower to but excluding 
the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of a 
payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Rate 
and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with 
banking industry rules on interbank compensation, and (ii) in the case of a 
payment to be made by such Borrower, the Adjusted Base Rate. If the 
applicable Borrower and the applicable Lender shall pay such interest to 
the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the 
Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to such Borrower the amount of 
such interest paid by such Borrower for such period. If the applicable 
Lender pays its Applicable Percentage of the applicable Borrowing to the 
Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such 
Lenders Loan included in such Borrowing. Any payment by the applicable 
Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim such Borrower may have 
against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the 
Administrative Agent.

(c) The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Loans, to fund 
participations in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans and to make 
payments pursuant to Section 11.1(c) are several and not joint. The failure 
of any Lender to make any Loan, to fund any such participation or to make 
any such payment on any date shall not relieve any other Lender of its 
corresponding obligation, if any, hereunder to do so on such date, but no 
Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make 
its Loan, fund its participation or to make any such payment required 
hereunder.

(d) Each Lender may, at its option, subject to Section 2.19, make and 
maintain any Loan at, to or for the account of any of its Lending Offices; 
provided that any exercise of such option shall not affect the obligation 
of the applicable Borrower to repay such Loan to or for the account of such 
Lender in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
 
48

------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.4 Evidence of Debt; Notes.

(a) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an 
account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of each Borrower to the 
applicable Lending Office of such Lender resulting from each Loan made by 
such Lending Office of such Lender from time to time, including the amounts 
of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lending Office of such 
Lender from time to time under this Agreement.

(b) The Administrative Agent shall maintain the Register pursuant to 
Section 11.6(d), and a subaccount for each Lender, in which Register and 
subaccounts (taken together) shall be recorded (i) the amount, Type and 
Currency of each Loan and the Interest Period, if any, applicable thereto, 
(ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become 
due and payable from each Borrower to each Lender hereunder in respect of 
each such Loan and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the 
Administrative Agent hereunder from any Borrower in respect of each such 
Loan and each Lenders share thereof.

(c) The entries made in the accounts, Register and subaccounts maintained 
pursuant to Section 2.4(b) (and, if consistent with the entries of the 
Administrative Agent, Section 2.4(a)) shall, to the extent permitted by 
applicable law, be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the 
obligations of each Borrower therein recorded; provided, however, that the 
failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such account, 
such Register or such subaccount, as applicable, or any error therein, 
shall not in any manner affect the obligation of each Borrower to repay 
(with applicable interest) the Loans made to such Borrower by such Lender 
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

(d) The Revolving Loans shall, if requested by the applicable Lender (which 
request shall be made to the Administrative Agent), be evidenced by a 
Revolving Note appropriately completed in substantially the form of 
Exhibit A-1. The Swingline Loans shall, if requested by the Swingline 
Lender (which request shall be made to the Administrative Agent), be 
evidenced by a Swingline Note appropriately completed in substantially the 
form of Exhibit A-2. Each Note shall be executed by the applicable Borrower 
and payable to the order of the applicable Lender or Swingline Lender, as 
the case may be. Each Note shall be entitled to all of the benefits of this 
Agreement and the other Credit Documents and shall be subject to the 
provisions hereof and thereof.


2.5 Termination and Reduction of Commitments and Swingline Commitment.

(a) The Commitments shall be automatically and permanently terminated on 
the Termination Date, unless sooner terminated pursuant to any other 
provision of this Section 2.5 or Section 9.2. The Swingline Commitment 
shall be automatically and permanently terminated on the Swingline Maturity 
Date, unless sooner terminated pursuant to any other provision of this 
Section 2.5 or Section 9.2.

(b) At any time and from time to time after the date hereof, upon not less 
than five Business Days prior written notice to the Administrative Agent 
(and in the case of a termination or reduction of the Unutilized Swingline 
Commitment, the Swingline Lender), Crawford may terminate in whole or 
reduce in part the aggregate Unutilized Commitments or the Unutilized
 
49

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Swingline Commitment; provided that any such partial reduction shall be in 
an aggregate amount of not less than $5,000,000 ($500,000 in the case of 
the Unutilized Swingline Commitment) and, if greater, an integral multiple 
of $1,000,000 in excess thereof ($100,000 in the case of the Unutilized 
Swingline Commitment). The amount of any termination or reduction made 
under this Section 2.5(b) may not thereafter be reinstated; provided that a 
notice of termination or reduction delivered by Crawford pursuant to this 
Section 2.5(b) may state that such termination or reduction is conditioned 
upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities or the receipt of 
proceeds from the issuance of other Indebtedness, in which case such notice 
may be revoked by Crawford (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or 
prior to one Business Day before the specified effective date) if such 
condition is not satisfied.

(c) Each reduction of the Commitments pursuant to this Section 2.5 shall be 
applied ratably among the Lenders according to their Applicable 
Percentages. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the 
contrary, any reduction of the Commitments pursuant to this Section 2.5 
that has the effect of reducing the aggregate Commitments to an amount less 
than the amount of the Swingline Commitment or the L/C Subcommitment at 
such time shall result in an automatic corresponding reduction of the 
Swingline Commitment or the L/C Subcommitment, as the case may be, to the 
amount of the aggregate Commitments (as so reduced), without any further 
action on the part of Crawford, the Swingline Lender or any other Lender or 
any Issuing Bank.


2.6 Mandatory Payments and Prepayments.

(a) Except to the extent due or paid sooner pursuant to the provisions of 
this Agreement, (i) the aggregate outstanding principal of the Revolving 
Loans shall be due and payable in full on the Maturity Date and (ii) the 
aggregate outstanding principal of the Swingline Loans shall be due and 
payable in full on the Swingline Maturity Date.

(b) If, at any time, the Dollar Amount of the Aggregate Credit Exposure 
(determined as of the most recent Revaluation Date and excluding the 
aggregate amount of any Swingline Loans to be repaid with proceeds of 
Revolving Loans made on the date of determination) shall exceed 105% (or, 
if no Loans denominated in any Foreign Currency are then outstanding, 100%) 
of the aggregate Commitments at such time (after giving effect to any 
concurrent termination or reduction thereof), then the applicable Borrower 
or Borrowers, as the case may be, shall immediately prepay the outstanding 
principal amount of the Swingline Loans and, to the extent of any excess 
remaining after prepayment in full of outstanding Swingline Loans, 
outstanding Reimbursement Obligations in the amount of such excess, and, to 
the extent of any excess remaining after prepayment in full of outstanding 
Reimbursement Obligations, the outstanding principal amount of the 
Revolving Loans in the amount of such excess; provided that, to the extent 
such excess amount is greater than the aggregate principal amount of 
Swingline Loans, Reimbursement Obligations and Revolving Loans outstanding 
immediately prior to the application of such prepayment, the amount so 
prepaid shall be retained by the Administrative Agent and held in the Cash 
Collateral Account as cover for L/C Exposure, as more particularly 
described in Section 3.8, and thereupon such cash shall be deemed to reduce 
the aggregate L/C Exposure by an equivalent amount; provided further that 
the Administrative Agent shall promptly return any Cash Collateral held in 
excess of the amount required to be held as Cash Collateral pursuant to 
this Section 2.6(b) as determined on any Revaluation Date.
 
50

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(c) If, at any time, the Dollar Amount of the Credit Extended (determined 
as of the most recent Revaluation Date and excluding the aggregate amount 
of any Swingline Loans to be repaid with proceeds of Revolving Loans made 
on the date of determination) to any Borrower shall exceed 105% (or, if no 
Loans denominated in any Foreign Currency are then outstanding to such 
Borrower, 100%) of such Borrowers Sublimit at such time (after giving 
effect to any concurrent termination or reduction thereof), then such 
Borrower shall immediately prepay the outstanding principal amount of the 
Revolving Loans made to such Borrower in the amount of such excess; 
provided that, to the extent such excess amount is greater than the 
aggregate principal amount of Revolving Loans made to such Borrower 
outstanding immediately prior to the application of such prepayment, the 
amount so prepaid shall be retained by the Administrative Agent and held in 
the Cash Collateral Account as cover for L/C Exposure, as more particularly 
described in Section 3.8, and thereupon such cash shall be deemed to reduce 
the aggregate L/C Exposure by an equivalent amount; provided further that 
the Administrative Agent shall promptly return any Cash Collateral held in 
excess of the amount required to be held as Cash Collateral pursuant to 
this Section 2.6(c) as determined on any Revaluation Date.


2.7 Voluntary Prepayments.

(a) At any time and from time to time, each Borrower shall have the right 
to prepay the Loans, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty 
(except as provided in clause (iii) below), upon written notice given to 
the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m., Charlotte time, (x) 
four Business Days prior to each intended prepayment of LIBOR Loans 
denominated in a Foreign Currency, (y) three Business Days prior to each 
intended prepayment of LIBOR Loans denominated in Dollars or (z) one 
Business Day prior to each intended prepayment of Base Rate Loans (other 
than Swingline Loans, which may be prepaid on a same-day basis); provided 
that (i) each partial prepayment shall be in an aggregate principal amount 
of not less than $1,000,000 and, if greater, an integral multiple of 
$500,000 in excess thereof ($100,000 and $100,000, respectively, in the 
case of Swingline Loans); (ii) no partial prepayment of LIBOR Loans made 
pursuant to any single Borrowing shall reduce the aggregate outstanding 
principal amount of the remaining LIBOR Loans under such Borrowing to less 
than $1,000,000 or to any greater amount not an integral multiple of 
$500,000 in excess thereof; and (iii) unless made together with all amounts 
required under Section 2.18 to be paid as a consequence of such prepayment, 
a prepayment of a LIBOR Loan may be made only on the last day of the 
Interest Period applicable thereto. Each such notice shall specify the 
proposed date of such prepayment and the aggregate principal amount, 
Currency and Type of the Loans to be prepaid (and, in the case of LIBOR 
Loans, the Interest Period of the Borrowing pursuant to which made), and 
shall be irrevocable and shall bind the applicable Borrower to make such 
prepayment on the terms specified therein. Revolving Loans and Swingline 
Loans prepaid pursuant to this Section 2.7(a) may be re-borrowed, subject 
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. In the event the 
Administrative Agent receives a notice of prepayment under this Section 
2.7(a), the Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to the 
Lenders; provided that if such notice has also been furnished to the 
Lenders, the Administrative Agent shall have no obligation to notify the 
Lenders with respect thereto.

(b) Each prepayment of the Loans made pursuant to Section 2.7(a) shall be 
applied ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans being prepaid, in 
proportion to the principal amount held by each; provided that if any 
Lender is a Defaulting Lender at the time of any such
 
51

------------------------------------------------------------------------
prepayment, any voluntary prepayment of the Loans shall, if the 
Administrative Agent so directs at the time of making such voluntary 
prepayment, be applied to the Loans of other Lenders as if such Defaulting 
Lender had no Loans outstanding and the outstanding Loans of such 
Defaulting Lender were zero.


2.8 Interest.

(a) Subject to Section 2.8(b), each Borrower will pay interest in respect 
of the unpaid principal amount of each Loan made to it, from the date of 
Borrowing thereof until such principal amount shall be paid in full, (i) at 
the Adjusted Base Rate, as in effect from time to time during such periods 
as such Loan is a Base Rate Loan, and (ii) at the Adjusted LIBOR Rate, as 
in effect from time to time during such periods as such Loan is a LIBOR 
Loan.

(b) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default 
under Sections 9.1(a), 9.1(f) or 9.1(g) and (at the election of the 
Required Lenders) upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any 
other Event of Default, all outstanding principal amounts of the Loans and, 
to the greatest extent permitted by law, all interest accrued on the Loans 
and all other past due accrued and outstanding fees and other amounts 
hereunder or under any other Credit Document, shall bear interest at a rate 
per annum equal to the interest rate applicable from time to time 
thereafter to such Loans (whether the Adjusted Base Rate or the Adjusted 
LIBOR Rate) plus 2% (or, in the case of interest, fees and other amounts 
for which no rate is provided hereunder, at the Adjusted Base Rate plus 
2%), and, in each case, such default interest shall be payable on demand by 
the Administrative Agent. To the greatest extent permitted by law, interest 
shall continue to accrue after the filing by or against the applicable 
Borrower of any petition seeking any relief under any Debtor Relief Law.

(c) Accrued (and theretofore unpaid) interest shall be payable as follows:

(i) in respect of each Base Rate Loan (including any Base Rate Loan or 
portion thereof paid or prepaid pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.6, 
except as provided hereinbelow), in arrears on the last Business Day of 
each calendar quarter, beginning with the first such day to occur after the 
Closing Date; provided that if all Loans are repaid or prepaid in full and 
the Commitments have been terminated, then accrued interest in respect of 
all Base Rate Loans shall be payable together with such repayment or 
prepayment on the date thereof;

(ii) in respect of each LIBOR Loan (including any LIBOR Loan or portion 
thereof paid or prepaid pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.6, except 
as provided hereinbelow), in arrears (y) on the last Business Day of the 
Interest Period applicable thereto (subject to the provisions of Section 
2.10(iv)) and (z) in addition, in the case of a LIBOR Loan with an Interest 
Period having a duration of six months, on each date on which interest 
would have been payable under clause (y) above had successive Interest 
Periods of three months duration been applicable to such LIBOR Loan; 
provided that if all LIBOR Loans made pursuant to a single Borrowing are 
repaid or prepaid in full, then accrued interest in respect of such LIBOR 
Loans shall be payable together with such repayment or prepayment on the 
date thereof; and
 
52

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(iii) in respect of any Loan, at maturity (whether pursuant to acceleration 
or otherwise) and, after maturity, on demand.

(d) (i) Nothing contained in this Agreement or in any other Credit Document 
shall be deemed to establish or require the payment of interest to the 
Administrative Agent or any Lender at a rate in excess of the maximum rate 
permitted by applicable law or, with respect to payments by the Canadian 
Borrower, at a rate that would result in a receipt by the Administrative 
Agent or any Lender of interest at a criminal rate (as such terms are 
construed under the Criminal Code (Canada)). If the amount of interest 
payable for the account of any Lender on any interest payment date would 
exceed the maximum amount permitted by applicable law to be charged by such 
Lender, the amount of interest payable for its account on such interest 
payment date shall be automatically reduced to such maximum permissible 
amount. In the event of any such reduction affecting any Lender, if from 
time to time thereafter the amount of interest payable for the account of 
such Lender on any interest payment date would be less than the maximum 
amount permitted by applicable law to be charged by such Lender, then the 
amount of interest payable for its account on such subsequent interest 
payment date shall be automatically increased to such maximum permissible 
amount; provided that at no time shall the aggregate amount by which 
interest paid for the account of any Lender has been increased pursuant to 
this sentence exceed the aggregate amount by which interest paid for its 
account has theretofore been reduced pursuant to the previous sentence.

(ii) If any provision of this Agreement or of any of the other Credit 
Document would obligate the Canadian Borrower to make any payment of 
interest or other amount payable to the Administrative Agent or any Lender 
in an amount or calculated at a rate which would result in a receipt by the 
Administrative Agent or such Lender of interest at a criminal rate (as such 
terms are construed under the Criminal Code (Canada)) then, notwithstanding 
such provisions, such amount or rate shall be deemed to have been adjusted 
with retroactive effect to the maximum amount or rate of interest, as the 
case may be, as would not be so prohibited or so result in a receipt by the 
Administrative Agent or such Lender of interest at a criminal rate, such 
adjustment to be effected, to the extent necessary, as follows: (1) 
firstly, by reducing the amount or rate of interest required to be paid to 
the Administrative Agent or such Lender under Section 2.8, and (2) 
thereafter, by reducing any fees, commissions, premiums and other amounts 
required to be paid to the Administrative Agent or such Lender which would 
constitute interest for purposes of Section 347 of the Criminal Code 
(Canada). Notwithstanding the foregoing, and after giving effect to all 
adjustments contemplated thereby, if the Administrative Agent or any Lender 
shall have received an amount in excess of the maximum permitted by that 
section of the Criminal Code (Canada), then the Canadian Borrower shall be 
entitled, by notice in writing to the Administrative Agent or such Lender, 
to obtain reimbursement from the Administrative Agent or such Lender in an 
amount equal to such excess and, pending such reimbursement, such amount 
shall be deemed to be an amount payable by the Administrative Agent or such 
Lender to the Canadian Borrower. Any amount or rate of interest referred to 
in the two immediately preceding sentences shall be determined in 
accordance with GAAP as an effective annual rate of interest over the term 
that the applicable Loan remains outstanding on the assumption that any 
charges, fees or expenses that fall within the meaning of interest
 
53

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(as defined in the Criminal Code (Canada)) shall, if they relate to a 
specific period of time, be pro-rated over that period of time and 
otherwise be pro-rated over the period from the Closing Date to the 
Termination Date.

(e) The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the applicable Borrower 
and the Lenders upon determining the interest rate for each Borrowing of 
LIBOR Loans after its receipt of the relevant Notice of Borrowing or Notice 
of Conversion/Continuation, and upon each change in the Base Rate; 
provided, however, that the failure of the Administrative Agent to provide 
any Borrower or the Lenders with any such notice shall neither affect any 
obligations of such Borrower or the Lenders hereunder nor result in any 
liability on the part of the Administrative Agent to such Borrower or any 
Lender. Each such determination (including each determination of the 
Reserve Requirement) shall, absent manifest error, be conclusive and 
binding on all parties hereto.

(f) In the event that any financial statement or Compliance Certificate 
delivered pursuant to Section 5.11, 6.1 or 6.2 is shown to be inaccurate 
(regardless of whether this Agreement or the Commitments are in effect when 
such inaccuracy is discovered), and such inaccuracy, if corrected, would 
have led to the application of a higher Applicable Rate for any period (an 
Applicable Period) than the Applicable Rate applied for such Applicable 
Period, then the applicable Borrower shall immediately (i) deliver to the 
Administrative Agent a correct Compliance Certificate for such Applicable 
Period, (ii) determine the Applicable Rate for such Applicable Period based 
upon the corrected Compliance Certificate and (iii) pay to the 
Administrative Agent the accrued additional interest and commitment fees 
owing as a result of such increased Applicable Rate for such Applicable 
Period, which payment shall be promptly applied by the Administrative Agent 
in accordance with Section 2.12(e). This Section 2.8(f) is in addition to 
the rights of the Administrative Agent and Lenders with respect to 
Sections 2.8(b) and 9.1 and other respective rights under this Agreement.

(g) For purposes of disclosure pursuant to the Interest Act (Canada), the 
annual rates of interest or fees to which the rates of interest or fees 
provided in this Agreement and the other Credit Documents (and stated 
herein or therein, as applicable, to be computed on the basis of a 360 day 
year or any other period of time less than a calendar year) are equivalent 
are the rates so determined multiplied by the actual number of days in the 
applicable calendar year and divided by 360 or the actual number of days in 
such other period of time, respectively.


2.9 Fees.

(a) Crawford agrees to pay:

(i) to the Arrangers and Wells Fargo, for their own respective accounts and 
the accounts of the Lenders (as applicable), on the Closing Date, the fees 
required under each Fee Letter to be paid to them on the Closing Date, in 
the amounts due and payable on the Closing Date as required by the terms 
thereof;

(ii) to the Administrative Agent, for the account of each Lender, a 
commitment fee for each calendar quarter (or portion thereof) for the 
period from the Closing Date to the Termination Date, at a per annum rate 
equal to the Applicable Rate in
 
54

------------------------------------------------------------------------
effect for such fee from time to time during such quarter on such Lenders 
Applicable Percentage of the average daily aggregate Unutilized Commitments 
(excluding clause (iii) of the definition thereof for purposes of this 
Section 2.9(a)(ii) only), payable in arrears (A) on the last Business Day 
of each calendar quarter, beginning with the first such day to occur after 
the Closing Date, and (B) on the Termination Date; provided, however, that 
no commitment fee shall accrue on the Unutilized Commitment of a Defaulting 
Lender during any period that such Lender shall be a Defaulting Lender; and

(iii) to the Administrative Agent, for its own account, the annual 
administrative fee described in the Fee Letter, on the terms, in the amount 
and at the times set forth therein.

(b) Each Borrower agrees to pay:

(i) to the Administrative Agent, for the account of each Lender, a letter 
of credit fee for each calendar quarter (or portion thereof) in respect of 
all Letters of Credit issued for the account of such Borrower outstanding 
during such quarter, at a per annum rate equal to the Applicable Rate in 
effect from time to time during such quarter for LIBOR Loans, on such 
Lenders Applicable Percentage of the Dollar Amount of the daily average 
aggregate Stated Amount of such Letters of Credit, payable in arrears (i) 
on the last Business Day of each calendar quarter, beginning with the first 
such day to occur after the Closing Date, and (ii) on the later of the 
Termination Date and the date of termination of the last outstanding Letter 
of Credit; provided, however, that any letter of credit fees otherwise 
payable for the account of a Defaulting Lender with respect to any Letter 
of Credit as to which such Defaulting Lender has not provided Cash 
Collateral satisfactory to the applicable Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 
3.1(a) shall be payable, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, 
to the other Lenders in accordance with the upward adjustments in their 
respective Applicable Percentages allocable to such Letter of Credit 
pursuant to Section 2.20(a)(iv), with the balance of such fee, if any, 
payable to the applicable Issuing Bank for its own account;

(ii) to each Issuing Bank, for its own account, any fronting fee required 
under any Fee Letter between such Borrower and such Issuing Bank, to be 
paid to such Issuing Bank with respect to each Letter of Credit issued for 
the account of such Borrower by such Issuing Bank, in the amounts due and 
at the times due as required by the terms thereof; and

(iii) to each Issuing Bank, for its own account, such transfer fees and 
other fees and charges incurred in connection with the issuance and 
administration of each Letter of Credit issued for the account of such 
Borrower by such Issuing Bank as are customarily charged from time to time 
by such Issuing Bank for the performance of such services in connection 
with similar letters of credit, or as may be otherwise agreed to by such 
Issuing Bank, but without duplication of amounts payable under Section 
2.9(b)(ii).

2.10 Interest Periods. Concurrently with the giving of a Notice of 
Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation in respect of any Borrowing 
comprising Base Rate Loans to be converted into, or LIBOR Loans to be 
continued as, LIBOR Loans, the applicable Borrower
 
55

------------------------------------------------------------------------
shall have the right to elect, pursuant to such notice, the interest period 
(each, an Interest Period) to be applicable to such LIBOR Loans, which 
Interest Period shall, at the option of such Borrower, be a one, two, three 
or six-month period; provided, however, that:

(i) all LIBOR Loans comprising a single Borrowing shall at all times have 
the same Interest Period;

(ii) the initial Interest Period for any LIBOR Loan shall commence on the 
date of the Borrowing of such LIBOR Loan (including the date of any 
continuation of, or conversion into, such LIBOR Loan), and each successive 
Interest Period applicable to such LIBOR Loan shall commence on the day on 
which the next preceding Interest Period applicable thereto expires;

(iii) LIBOR Loans may not be outstanding under more than 20 separate 
Interest Periods at any one time (for which purpose Interest Periods of 
different durations shall be deemed to be separate even if they are 
coterminous);

(iv) if any Interest Period otherwise would expire on a day that is not a 
Business Day, such Interest Period shall expire on the next succeeding 
Business Day unless such next succeeding Business Day falls in another 
calendar month, in which case such Interest Period shall expire on the next 
preceding Business Day;

(v) a Borrower may not select any Interest Period that expires after the 
Maturity Date;

(vi) if any Interest Period begins on a day for which there is no 
numerically corresponding day in the calendar month during which such 
Interest Period would otherwise expire, such Interest Period shall expire 
on the last Business Day of such calendar month; and

(vii) a Borrower may not select any Interest Period (and consequently, no 
LIBOR Loans shall be made) if a Default or Event of Default shall have 
occurred and be continuing at the time of such Notice of Borrowing or 
Notice of Conversion/Continuation with respect to any Borrowing.


2.11 Conversions and Continuations.

(a) Any Borrower shall have the right, on any Business Day occurring on or 
after the Closing Date, to elect (i) to convert all or a portion of the 
outstanding principal amount of any of its Base Rate Loans into LIBOR 
Loans, or to convert any of its LIBOR Loans the Interest Periods for which 
end on the same day into Base Rate Loans, or (ii) upon the expiration of 
any Interest Period, to continue all or a portion of the outstanding 
principal amount of any of its LIBOR Loans the Interest Periods for which 
end on the same day for an additional Interest Period; provided that, in 
each case, (u) a Borrowing denominated in one Currency may not be continued 
as, or converted into, a Borrowing denominated in a different Currency; (v) 
a Borrowing of LIBOR Loans denominated in a Foreign Currency may not be 
converted into a Borrowing of a different Type; (w) (1) any conversion of 
LIBOR Loans into Base Rate Loans shall involve an aggregate principal 
amount of not less than $1,000,000 and, if greater, an
 
56

------------------------------------------------------------------------
integral multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof, (2) any conversion of Base 
Rate Loans into, or continuation of, LIBOR Loans shall involve an aggregate 
principal amount of not less than $1,000,000 and, if greater, an integral 
multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof; and (3) no partial conversion of 
LIBOR Loans made pursuant to a single Borrowing shall reduce the 
outstanding principal amount of LIBOR Loans made pursuant to such Borrowing 
to less than $1,000,000 or to any greater amount not an integral multiple 
of $500,000 in excess thereof; (x) except as otherwise provided in Section 
2.16(f), LIBOR Loans may be converted into Base Rate Loans only on the last 
day of the Interest Period applicable thereto (and, in any event, if a 
LIBOR Loan is converted into a Base Rate Loan on any day other than the 
last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, the applicable Borrower 
shall pay, upon such conversion, all amounts required under Section 2.18 
to be paid as a consequence thereof); (y) no conversion or continuation 
shall be permitted with regard to Swingline Loans; and (z) no conversion of 
Base Rate Loans into LIBOR Loans or continuation of LIBOR Loans shall be 
permitted during the continuance of a Default or Event of Default.

(b) A Borrower shall make each such election by giving the Administrative 
Agent written notice not later than 12:00 p.m., Charlotte time, (i) three 
Business Days prior to the intended effective date of any conversion of 
Base Rate Loans into LIBOR Loans or continuation of LIBOR Loans denominated 
in Dollars, (ii) four Business Days prior to the intended effective date of 
any continuation of LIBOR Loans denominated in a Foreign Currency, or (iii) 
two Business Days prior to the intended effective date of any conversion of 
LIBOR Loans into Base Rate Loans. Each such notice (each, a Notice of 
Conversion/Continuation) shall be irrevocable, shall be given in the form 
of Exhibit B-3 and shall specify (x) the date of such conversion or 
continuation (which shall be a Business Day), (y) in the case of a 
conversion into, or a continuation of, LIBOR Loans, the Interest Period to 
be applicable thereto, and (z) the aggregate amount, Currency and Type of 
the Loans being converted or continued. Upon the receipt of a Notice of 
Conversion/Continuation, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify 
each applicable Lender of the proposed conversion or continuation. If any 
Borrower shall fail to deliver a timely Notice of Conversion/Continuation 
as provided herein (1) with respect to any of its outstanding LIBOR Loans 
denominated in Dollars, then such LIBOR Loans shall automatically be 
converted to Base Rate Loans upon the expiration of the then current 
Interest Period applicable thereto (unless repaid pursuant to the terms 
hereof) or (2) with respect to any of its outstanding LIBOR Loans 
denominated in a Foreign Currency, then such LIBOR Loans shall be 
automatically continued as LIBOR Loans denominated in such Foreign Currency 
with an Interest Period of one month upon the expiration of the then 
current Interest Period applicable thereto. If a Borrower shall have failed 
to select in a Notice of Conversion/Continuation the duration of the 
Interest Period to be applicable to any conversion into, or continuation 
of, LIBOR Loans, then such Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an 
Interest Period with a duration of one month.


2.12 Method of Payments; Computations; Apportionment of Payments.

(a) Unless the applicable Borrower expressly specifies otherwise, all 
payments and reimbursements made by such Borrower shall be made for the 
account of such Borrower. All payments and reimbursements by a Borrower 
hereunder shall be made without setoff, counterclaim or other defense, in 
the applicable Currency and in immediately available funds to the 
Administrative Agent, for the account of the Lenders or Issuing Banks 
entitled to such
 
57

------------------------------------------------------------------------
payment or the Administrative Agent or the Swingline Lender, as the case 
may be (except as otherwise expressly provided herein as to payments 
required to be made directly to an Issuing Bank or the Lenders) in 
accordance with the applicable Payment Instructions prior to (i) (A) with 
respect to a payment denominated in Japanese Yen, 9:00 a.m., Tokyo time, 
(B) with respect to a payment denominated in Australian Dollars, 9:00 a.m., 
Sydney time, or (C) with respect to a payment denominated in any other 
Forward Foreign Currency, 9:00 a.m., local time for the central bank of the 
issuing jurisdiction of such Forward Foreign Currency, (ii) with respect to 
a payment denominated in any other Foreign Currency, 1:00 p.m., London 
time, or (iii) with respect to a payment denominated in Dollars, 2:00 p.m., 
Charlotte time. Any payment made as required hereinabove, but after the 
applicable time specified above, shall be deemed to have been made on the 
next succeeding Business Day. If any payment falls due on a day that is not 
a Business Day, then such due date shall be extended to the next succeeding 
Business Day (except in the case of LIBOR Loans to which the provisions of 
Section 2.10(iv) are applicable), and such extension of time shall then be 
included in the computation of payment of interest, fees or other 
applicable amounts.

(b) The Administrative Agent will distribute to the Lenders like amounts 
relating to payments made to the Administrative Agent for the account of 
the Lenders as follows: (i) if the payment is received by (A) (1) with 
respect to a payment denominated in Japanese Yen, 9:00 a.m., Tokyo time, 
(2) with respect to a payment denominated in Australian Dollars, 9:00 a.m., 
Sydney time, or (3) with respect to a payment denominated in any other 
Forward Foreign Currency, 9:00 a.m., local time for the central bank of the 
issuing jurisdiction of such Forward Foreign Currency, (B) with respect to 
a payment denominated in any other Foreign Currency, 1:00 p.m., London 
time, or (C) with respect to a payment denominated in Dollars, 2:00 p.m., 
Charlotte time, in immediately available funds, then the Administrative 
Agent shall make available to each relevant Lender on the same date, by 
wire transfer of immediately available funds, such Lenders ratable share 
of such payment (based on the percentage that the amount of the relevant 
payment owing to such Lender bears to the total amount of such payment 
owing to all of the relevant Lenders); and (ii) if such payment is received 
after the applicable time specified in clause (i), or in other than 
immediately available funds, then the Administrative Agent shall make 
available to each relevant Lender its ratable share of such payment by wire 
transfer of immediately available funds on the next succeeding Business Day 
(or in the case of uncollected funds, as soon as practicable after 
collected). Notwithstanding the foregoing or any contrary provision hereof, 
if any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it 
hereunder to the Administrative Agent, an Issuing Bank or the Swingline 
Lender, then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion, apply any 
amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of 
such Lender to satisfy such Lenders obligations to the Administrative 
Agent, such Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, as the case may be, until 
all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid. If the Administrative 
Agent shall not have made a required distribution to the appropriate 
Lenders as required hereinabove after receiving a payment for the account 
of such Lenders, the Administrative Agent shall pay to each such Lender, on 
demand, its ratable share of such payment with interest thereon at the 
Federal Funds Rate for each day from the date such amount was required to 
be disbursed by the Administrative Agent until the date repaid to such 
Lender. The Administrative Agent shall distribute to each Issuing Bank like 
amounts relating to payments made to the Administrative Agent for the 
account of such Issuing Bank in the same manner, and subject to the same 
terms and conditions, as set forth hereinabove with respect to 
distributions of amounts to the Lenders.
 
58

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(c) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the 
applicable Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the 
Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or an Issuing Bank 
hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative 
Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment on such date in 
accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute 
to the Lenders or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due. In 
such event, if the applicable Borrower has not in fact made such payment, 
then each of the Lenders or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, 
severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand 
the amount so distributed to such Lender or such Issuing Bank, with 
interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is 
distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the 
Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate 
determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry 
rules on interbank compensation.

(d) All computations of interest and fees hereunder (including computations 
of the Reserve Requirement) shall be made on the basis of a year consisting 
of (i) in the case of interest on Base Rate Loans based on the prime 
commercial lending rate of the Administrative Agent or on LIBOR Loans 
denominated in Sterling, Australian Dollars or Canadian Dollars, 365/366 
days, as the case may be, or (ii) in all other instances, 360 days; and in 
each case under clause (i) or (ii) above, with regard to the actual number 
of days (including the first day, but excluding the last day) elapsed.

(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or any other 
Credit Document to the contrary, all amounts collected or received by the 
Administrative Agent or any Lender (or any Security Trustee pursuant to any 
Foreign Pledge Document, but subject to any rights of the Security Trustee 
under such Foreign Pledge Document) from Crawford, any U.S. Subsidiary or 
any Disregarded Foreign Subsidiary after acceleration of the Loans pursuant 
to Section 9.2 or in respect of any sale of, collection from or other 
realization upon all or any part of the Collateral (other than the Foreign 
Collateral, but subject to Section 2.12(g)) pursuant to the exercise by the 
Administrative Agent or any Security Trustee of its remedies shall be 
applied by the Administrative Agent as follows:

(i) first, to the payment of U.S. Obligations consisting of reasonable 
out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys and 
consultants fees irrespective of whether such fees are allowed as a claim 
after the occurrence of a Bankruptcy Event) of the Administrative Agent in 
connection with enforcing the rights of the Lenders under the Credit 
Documents and any protective advances made by the Administrative Agent with 
respect to the Collateral under or in accordance with the terms of the 
Security Documents;

(ii) second, to the payment of U.S. Obligations consisting of fees owed to 
the Administrative Agent hereunder or under any other Credit Document;

(iii) third, to the payment of all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket 
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys and consultants fees 
irrespective of whether such fees are allowed as a claim after the 
occurrence of a Bankruptcy Event) of each of the Lenders in connection with

Disregarded Foreign Subsidiary under the Credit Documents or otherwise with 
respect to the U.S. Obligations owing to such Lender;

(iv) fourth, to the payment of all of the U.S. Obligations consisting of 
accrued fees and interest (including fees incurred and interest accruing at 
the then applicable rate after the occurrence of a Bankruptcy Event 
irrespective of whether a claim for such fees incurred and interest 
accruing is allowed in such proceeding);

(v) fifth, to the payment of the outstanding principal amount of the U.S. 
Obligations (including the payment of any outstanding Reimbursement 
Obligations and the obligation to Cash Collateralize L/C Exposure, in each 
case, to the extent constituting U.S. Obligations), and including U.S. 
Obligations under (A) any Hedge Agreement between Crawford, any U.S. 
Subsidiary or any Disregarded Foreign Subsidiary and any Hedge Party (to 
the extent such Hedge Agreement is required or permitted hereunder) and (B) 
any Cash Management Agreement between Crawford, any U.S. Subsidiary or any 
Disregarded Foreign Subsidiary and any Cash Management Bank;

(vi) sixth, to the payment of Foreign Subsidiary Obligations remaining

In carrying out the foregoing, (x) all amounts shall be apportioned ratably 
among the Lenders (and Hedge Parties and Cash Management Banks, as 
applicable) in proportion to the amounts of such principal, interest, fees 
or other U.S. Obligations owed to them respectively pursuant to clauses 
(iii) through (vii) above; and (y) to the extent that any amounts available 
for distribution pursuant to clause (v) above are attributable to the 
issued but undrawn amount of outstanding Letters of Credit, such amounts 
shall be held by the Administrative Agent to Cash Collateralize L/C 
Exposure pursuant to Section 3.8. Notwithstanding the foregoing, 
Obligations arising under Cash Management Agreements and Hedge Agreements 
shall be excluded from the application described above if the 
Administrative Agent has not received written notice thereof, together with 
such reasonable supporting documentation as the Administrative Agent may 
reasonably request, from the applicable Cash Management Bank or Hedge 
Party, as the case may be. Each Cash Management Bank or Hedge Party not a 
party to this Agreement that has given the notice contemplated by the 
preceding sentence shall, by such notice, be deemed to have acknowledged 
and accepted the appointment of the Administrative Agent pursuant to the 
terms of Article X for itself and its Affiliates as if a Lender party 
hereto.

(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or any other 
Credit Document to the contrary, all amounts collected or received by the 
Administrative Agent or any Lender (or any Security Trustee pursuant to any 
Foreign Pledge Document, but subject to any rights of the Security Trustee 
under such Foreign Pledge Document) from any Foreign

Subsidiary (other than a Disregarded Foreign Subsidiary) after acceleration 
of the Loans pursuant to Section 9.2 or in respect of any sale of, 
collection from or other realization upon all or any part of the Foreign 
Collateral (subject to Section 2.12(g)) pursuant to the exercise by the 
Administrative Agent or any Security Trustee of its remedies shall be 
applied by the Administrative Agent as follows:

(i) first, to the payment of Foreign Subsidiary Obligations consisting of 
reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable 
attorneys and consultants fees irrespective of whether such fees are 
allowed as a claim after the occurrence of a Bankruptcy Event) of the 
Administrative Agent in connection with enforcing the rights of the Lenders 
under the Credit Documents and any protective advances made by the

accordance with the terms of the Security Documents;

(ii) second, to the payment of Foreign Subsidiary Obligations consisting of 
fees owed to the Administrative Agent hereunder or under any other Credit

enforcing its rights against the Foreign Subsidiaries (other than the 
Disregarded Foreign Subsidiaries) under the Credit Documents or otherwise 
with respect to the Foreign Subsidiary Obligations owing to such Lender;

(iv) fourth, to the payment of all of the Foreign Subsidiary Obligations

interest accruing is allowed in such proceeding);

(v) fifth, to the payment of the outstanding principal amount of the 
Foreign Subsidiary Obligations (including the payment of any outstanding 
Reimbursement Obligations and the obligation to Cash Collateralize L/C 
Exposure, in each case, to the extent constituting Foreign Subsidiary 
Obligations), and including Obligations under (A) any Hedge Agreement 
between any Foreign Subsidiary (other than a Disregarded Foreign 
Subsidiary) and any Hedge Party (to the extent such Hedge Agreement is

Subsidiary) and any Cash Management Bank;

(vi) sixth, to the payment of all other Foreign Subsidiary Obligations and 
other obligations of a Foreign Subsidiary that shall have become due and

lawfully entitled to receive such surplus (subject to Section 2.12(g)).
 
61

------------------------------------------------------------------------
In carrying out the foregoing, (x) all amounts shall be apportioned ratably 
among the Lenders (and Hedge Parties and Cash Management Banks, as 
applicable) in proportion to the amounts of such principal, interest, fees 
or other Foreign Subsidiary Obligations owed to them respectively pursuant 
to clauses (iii) through (vi) above; and (y) to the extent that any amounts 
available for distribution pursuant to clause (v) above are attributable to 
the issued but undrawn amount of outstanding Letters of Credit, such 
amounts shall be held by the Administrative Agent to Cash Collateralize L/C 
Exposure pursuant to Section 3.8. Notwithstanding the foregoing, 
Obligations arising under Cash Management Agreements and Hedge Agreements 
shall be excluded from the application described above if the 
Administrative Agent has not received written notice thereof, together with 
such reasonable supporting documentation as the Administrative Agent may 
reasonably request, from the applicable Cash Management Bank or Hedge 
Party, as the case may be. Each Cash Management Bank or Hedge Party not a 
party to this Agreement that has given the notice contemplated by the 
preceding sentence shall, by such notice, be deemed to have acknowledged 
and accepted the appointment of the Administrative Agent pursuant to the 
terms of Article X for itself and its Affiliates as if a Lender party 
hereto.

(g) Proceeds from any sale of, collection from or other realization of any 
Foreign Collateral pursuant to the exercise by the Administrative Agent or 
any Security Trustee of its remedies shall be applied only to the Foreign 
Subsidiary Obligations in accordance with Section 2.12(f); provided, 
however, that if, prior to the commencement of any rights or remedies with 
respect to the voting Capital Stock issued by any Foreign Subsidiary or 
Foreign Subsidiary Holding Company constituting Foreign Collateral, the 
Administrative Agent and any applicable Security Trustee shall have 
released their respective Liens on a sufficient amount of voting Capital 
Stock of such Foreign Subsidiary or such Foreign Subsidiary Holding 
Company, as applicable, so that, at the time of the initial exercise of any 
right or remedy against the voting Capital Stock of such Foreign Subsidiary 
or such Foreign Subsidiary Holding Company, as applicable, and after giving 
effect thereto, neither the Administrative Agent nor any Security Trustee 
shall have a Lien on more than 65% of the voting Capital Stock issued by 
such Foreign Subsidiary or such Foreign Subsidiary Holding Company, as 
applicable, then the Administrative Agent or applicable Security Trustee 
may apply such proceeds of such voting Capital Stock to U.S. Obligations in 
accordance with Section 2.12(e). In addition, notwithstanding any provision 
set forth in this Agreement or any Credit Document to the contrary, to the 
extent that the Administrative Agent or any Security Trustee is not 
permitted to apply the proceeds of any Foreign Collateral in accordance 
with Section 2.12(e) pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence and 
there are surplus proceeds required to be paid to the pledgor of such 
Foreign Collateral pursuant to Section 2.12(f)(vii), (i) no payment to the 
pledgor of such Foreign Collateral of any surplus proceeds shall be made to 
a deposit account in which the Administrative Agent, any Security Trustee 
or any Lender has any Lien or right of setoff and (ii) such pledgor shall 
not have any obligation to maintain any such surplus proceeds in any 
deposit account in which the Administrative Agent or any Security Trustee 
shall have a Lien. The Administrative Agent may, with the consent of the 
Required Lenders, or shall, at the direction of the Required Lenders, 
release, and direct each Security Trustee to release, such Liens as are 
contemplated to be released by this Section 2.12(g) to permit application 
of proceeds in accordance Section 2.12(e).

(h) All monies received by Wells Fargo, in its capacity as Administrative 
Agent or as any Security Trustee, except for monies received by any 
Security Trustee under or pursuant to any Foreign Pledge Document, shall be 
deemed received by Wells Fargo in its capacity as Administrative Agent.
 
62

------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.13 Recovery of Payments.

(a) Each Borrower agrees if such Borrower makes a payment or payments to or 
for the account of the Administrative Agent, the Swingline Lender, any 
Lender or any Issuing Bank, which payment or payments or any part thereof 
are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, 
set aside or required to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other 
party under any Debtor Relief Law, common law or equitable cause (whether 
as a result of any demand, settlement, litigation or otherwise), then, to 
the extent of such invalidation, declaration, setting aside or repayment, 
the Obligation intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in 
full force and effect as if such payment had not been received, and each 
Lender and each Issuing Bank severally agrees to pay to the Administrative 
Agent upon demand its applicable ratable share (without duplication) of any 
amount so recovered from or repaid by the Administrative Agent plus 
interest thereon at a per annum rate equal to the Federal Funds Rate from 
the date of such demand to the date such payment is made to the 
Administrative Agent.

(b) If any such amounts are recovered by the Administrative Agent from a 
Borrower, its representative or successor in interest or such other Person, 
the Administrative Agent shall redistribute such amounts to the Lenders or 
the applicable Issuing Bank on the same basis as such amounts were 
originally distributed.

2.14 Use of Proceeds. The proceeds of the Loans shall be used (i) to pay or 
reimburse permitted fees and expenses in connection with the transactions 
contemplated by the Credit Documents and (ii) to provide for working 
capital and general corporate purposes and in accordance with the terms and 
provisions of this Agreement (including to finance Capital Expenditures, 
Permitted Acquisitions, Investments and Restricted Payments to the extent 
permitted under, and in accordance with the terms and provisions of, this 
Agreement).


2.15 Pro Rata Treatment.

(a) Except in the case of Swingline Loans, all fundings, continuations and 
conversions of Loans shall be made by the Lenders pro rata on the basis of 
their Applicable Percentages (in the case of the funding of Loans pursuant 
to Section 2.2) or on the basis of their respective outstanding Loans (in 
the case of continuations and conversions of Loans pursuant to Section 2.11
, and additionally in all cases if the Commitments have expired or have 
been terminated). All payments on account of principal of or interest on 
any Loans, fees or any other Obligations owing to or for the account of any 
one or more Lenders shall be apportioned ratably among such Lenders in 
proportion to the amounts of such principal, interest, fees or other 
Obligations owed to them respectively.

(b) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim 
or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on 
any of its Loans or other Obligations hereunder (other than as a result of 
a right of setoff exercised by a Lender in the ordinary course of business 
in respect of any fees or expenses owed under any Cash Management 
Agreement) resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a proportion of 
the aggregate amount of its Loans
 
63

------------------------------------------------------------------------
to a Borrower and accrued interest thereon or other such Obligations owed 
by a Borrower greater than its pro rata share thereof as provided herein, 
then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (i) notify the 
Administrative Agent of such fact and (ii) purchase (for cash at face 
value) participations in the Loans to the applicable Borrower and such 
other Obligations owed by the applicable Borrower of the other Lenders, or 
make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of 
all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with 
the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their 
respective Loans and other amounts owing them by such Borrower; provided 
that (A) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of 
the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be 
rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, 
without interest, and (B) the provisions of this Section 2.15(b) shall not 
be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by any Borrower pursuant to 
and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (including the 
application of funds arising from the existence of a Defaulting Lender or a 
Disqualified Lender), (y) the application of Cash Collateral provided for 
in Section 3.8 or (z) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for 
the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or 
participations in Reimbursement Obligations or Swingline Loans to any 
assignee or Participant, other than to a Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof 
(as to which the provisions of this Section 2.15(b) shall apply). Each 
Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may 
effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a 
participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against 
such Borrower rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such 
participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such 
Borrower in the amount of such participation. If, under any applicable 
Debtor Relief Laws, any Lender receives a secured claim in lieu of a setoff 
to which this Section 2.15(b) applies, then such Lender shall, to the 
extent practicable, exercise its rights in respect of such secured claim in 
a manner consistent with the rights of the Lenders entitled under this 
Section 2.15(b) to share in the benefits of any recovery on such secured 
claim.


2.16 Increased Costs; Change in Circumstances; Illegality.

(a) If any Change in Law shall:

(i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, 
compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, 
deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in 
by, any Lender (except the Reserve Requirement reflected in the LIBOR Rate) 
or any Issuing Bank;

(ii) subject any Recipient to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, 
(B) Taxes described in clauses (ii) through (iv) of the definition of 
Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan 
principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its 
deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; or

(iii) impose on any Lender or Issuing Bank or the London interbank market 
any other condition, cost or expense (other than Taxes) affecting this 
Agreement or LIBOR Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or 
participation therein;
 
64

------------------------------------------------------------------------
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to 
such Lender or such other Recipient of making, converting to, continuing or 
maintaining any LIBOR Loan or of maintaining its obligation to make any 
such Loan, or to increase the cost to such Lender, such Issuing Bank or 
such other Recipient of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter 
of Credit (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue 
any Letter of Credit), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or 
receivable by such Lender, such Issuing Bank or such other Recipient 
hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount), then, upon 
request of such Lender, such Issuing Bank or such other Recipient, the 
applicable Borrower shall pay to such Lender, such Issuing Bank or such 
other Recipient, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as 
will compensate such Lender, such Issuing Bank or such other Recipient, as 
the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.

(b) If any Lender or Issuing Bank determines that any Change in Law 
affecting such Lender or Issuing Bank or any Lending Office of such Lender 
or Issuing Bank or such Lenders or Issuing Banks holding company, if any, 
regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of 
reducing the rate of return on such Lenders or Issuing Banks capital or 
on the capital of such Lenders or Issuing Banks holding company, if any, 
as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the 
Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit or Swingline Loans 
held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank, 
to a level below that which such Lender or Issuing Bank or such Lenders or 
Issuing Banks holding company could have achieved but for such Change in 
Law (taking into consideration such Lenders or Issuing Banks policies and 
the policies of such Lenders or Issuing Banks holding company with 
respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time Crawford shall pay to 
such Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or 
amounts as will compensate such Lender or Issuing Bank or such Lenders or 
Issuing Banks holding company for any such reduction suffered.

(c) A certificate of a Lender or any Issuing Bank setting forth the amount 
or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or Issuing Bank or its 
holding company, as the case may be, as specified in Section 2.16(a) or 
2.16(b) and delivered to the applicable Borrower shall be conclusive absent 
manifest error. The applicable Borrower shall pay such Lender or Issuing 
Bank, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate 
within ten days after receipt thereof.

(d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or Issuing Bank to demand 
compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.16 
shall not constitute a waiver of such Lenders or Issuing Banks right to 
demand such compensation; provided that the Borrowers shall not be required 
to compensate a Lender or any Issuing Bank pursuant to the foregoing 
provisions of this Section 2.16 for any increased costs incurred or 
reductions suffered more than 120 days prior to the date that such Lender 
or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, notifies the applicable Borrower of 
the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of 
such Lenders or Issuing Banks intention to claim compensation therefor 
(except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or 
reductions is retroactive, then the 120-day period referred to above shall 
be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).
 
65

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(e) If, on or prior to the first day of any Interest Period, (x) the 
Administrative Agent shall have determined that adequate and reasonable 
means do not exist for ascertaining the applicable LIBOR Rate for such 
Interest Period or (y) the Administrative Agent shall have received written 
notice from the Required Lenders of their determination that the rate of 
interest referred to in the definition of LIBOR Rate upon the basis of 
which the Adjusted LIBOR Rate for LIBOR Loans for such Interest Period is 
to be determined will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such 
Lenders of making or maintaining LIBOR Loans during such Interest Period, 
the Administrative Agent shall forthwith so notify the Borrowers and the 
Lenders. Upon such notice, (i) all outstanding LIBOR Loans shall 
automatically, on the expiration date of the respective Interest Periods 
applicable thereto (unless then repaid in full), be converted into Base 
Rate Loans; (ii) the obligation of the Lenders to make, to convert Base 
Rate Loans into, or to continue LIBOR Loans shall be suspended (including 
with respect to any Borrowing for which the Administrative Agent has 
received a Notice of Borrowing but for which the Borrowing Date has not 
arrived); and (iii) any Notice of Borrowing or Notice of 
Conversion/Continuation then pending or given at any time thereafter with 
respect to LIBOR Loans shall be deemed to be a request for Base Rate Loans; 
in each case until the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders, as the 
case may be, shall have determined that the circumstances giving rise to 
such suspension no longer exist (and the Required Lenders, if making such 
determination, shall have so notified the Administrative Agent), and the 
Administrative Agent shall have so notified the Borrowers and the Lenders.

(f) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, if, at any time 
after the Closing Date and from time to time, any Lender shall have 
determined in good faith that the introduction of or any change in any 
applicable law, rule or regulation or in the interpretation or 
administration thereof by any Governmental Authority charged with the 
interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance with any guideline 
or request from any such Governmental Authority (whether or not having the 
force of law), has or would have the effect of making it unlawful for such 
Lender to make or to continue to make or maintain LIBOR Loans, such Lender 
shall forthwith so notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers. Upon 
such notice, (i) each of such Lenders outstanding LIBOR Loans shall 
automatically, on the expiration date of the respective Interest Period 
applicable thereto (or, to the extent any such LIBOR Loan may not lawfully 
be maintained as a LIBOR Loan until such expiration date, upon such notice) 
and to the extent not sooner prepaid, be converted into a Base Rate Loan; 
(ii) the obligation of such Lender to make, to convert Base Rate Loans 
into, or to continue, LIBOR Loans shall be suspended (including with 
respect to any Borrowing for which the Administrative Agent has received a 
Notice of Borrowing but for which the Borrowing Date has not arrived); and 
(iii) any Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation then 
pending or given at any time thereafter with respect to LIBOR Loans shall, 
as to such Lender, be deemed to be a request for a Base Rate Loan; in each 
case until such Lender shall have determined that the circumstances giving 
rise to such suspension no longer exist and shall have so notified the 
Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent shall have so notified 
the Borrowers.


2.17 Taxes.

(a) For purposes of this Section 2.17, the term Lender includes any 
Issuing Bank.
 
66

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(b) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Credit 
Party under any Credit Document shall be made without deduction or 
withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable law. If any 
applicable law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable 
Withholding Agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from 
any such payment by a Withholding Agent, then the applicable Withholding 
Agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall 
timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant 
Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law and, if such Tax 
is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by such Borrower shall be 
increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been 
made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional 
sums payable under this Section 2.17) the applicable Recipient receives an 
amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or 
withholding been made.

(c) Each Borrower shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority 
in accordance with applicable law, or at the option of the Administrative 
Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, all Other Taxes.

(d) Subject to Sections 11.13 and 11.14, each Borrower shall indemnify each 
Recipient, within ten days after demand therefor, for the full amount of 
any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on 
or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 2.17) payable or paid 
by such Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to 
such Recipient and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with 
respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or 
legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A 
certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the 
applicable Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), 
or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, 
shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

(e) Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 
ten days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable 
to such Lender (but only to the extent that the applicable Borrower has not 
already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and 
without limiting the obligation of such Borrower to do so), (ii) any Taxes 
attributable to such Lenders failure to comply with the provisions of 
Section 11.6(e) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and 
(iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that 
are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any 
Credit Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with 
respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally 
imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate 
as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by 
the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each 
Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to off set and apply any 
and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Credit Document 
or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to the Lender from any 
other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this 
Section 2.17(e).

(f) With respect to each payment of Taxes by any Borrower to a Governmental 
Authority pursuant to this Section 2.17, such Borrower shall deliver to the 
Administrative Agent a copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental 
Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such 
payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the 
Administrative Agent, in each case as soon as practicable after receiving 
the same.
 
67

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(g) Status of Lenders.

(i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of 
withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Credit Document 
shall deliver to any Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or 
times reasonably requested by such Borrower or the Administrative Agent, 
such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by 
such Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to 
be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In 
addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by any Borrower or the 
Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by 
applicable law or reasonably requested by such Borrower or the 
Administrative Agent as will enable such Borrower or the Administrative 
Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup 
withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything 
to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution 
and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set 
forth in Sections 2.17(g)(ii)(A), 2.17(g)(ii)(B) and 2.17(g)(ii)(D)) shall 
not be required if in such Lenders reasonable judgment such completion, 
execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material 
unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or 
commercial position of such Lender.

(ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that a 
Borrower is a U.S. Person,

(A) any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to such Borrower and the 
Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a 
Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the 
reasonable request of such Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed 
originals of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. 
federal backup withholding tax;

(B) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do 
so, deliver to such Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number 
of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date 
on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and 
from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of such Borrower 
or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:

(1) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax 
treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments 
of interest under any Credit Document, executed originals of IRS Form 
W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, as applicable (or successor form), establishing an 
exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to 
the interest article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other 
applicable payments under any Credit Document, IRS Form W-8BEN
 
68

------------------------------------------------------------------------
or W-8BEN-E, as applicable (or successor form), establishing an exemption 
from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the 
business profits or other income article of such tax treaty;

(2) executed originals of IRS Form W-8ECI;

(3) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption 
for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate 
substantially in the form of Exhibit H-1 to the effect that such Foreign 
Lender is not a bank within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the 
Code, a 10 percent shareholder of such Borrower within the meaning of 
Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a controlled foreign corporation 
described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a U.S. Tax Compliance 
Certificate) and (y) executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, as 
applicable (or successor form); or

(4) to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed 
originals of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form 
W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, as applicable (or successor form), a U.S. Tax 
Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-2 or Exhibit 
H-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each 
beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a 
partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign 
Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender 
may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of 
Exhibit H-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner;

(C) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do 
so, deliver to such Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number 
of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date 
on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and 
from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of such Borrower 
or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of any other form 
prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a 
reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with 
such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to 
permit such Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the 
withholding or deduction required to be made; and

(D) if a payment made to a Lender under any Credit Document would be 
subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender 
were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA 
(including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as 
applicable), such Lender shall deliver to such Borrower and the 
Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such 
time or times reasonably requested by such Borrower or the Administrative 
Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as 
prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i)
 
69

------------------------------------------------------------------------
of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by such 
Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for such Borrower 
and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA 
and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lenders 
obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold 
from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (D), FATCA shall 
include any amendments made to FATCA after the Closing Date.

Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously 
delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it 
shall update such form or certification or promptly notify such Borrower 
and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.

(h) If any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good 
faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been 
indemnified pursuant to this Section 2.17 (including by the payment of 
additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.17) or obtained and retained 
a credit against, relief or remission of any such Indemnified Tax, it shall 
pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to 
the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section 2.17 with respect 
to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses 
(including Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other 
than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect 
to such refund). Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such 
indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid 
over pursuant to this Section 2.17(h) (plus any penalties, interest or 
other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event 
that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such 
Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this 
Section 2.17(h), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay 
any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this Section 2.17(h) the 
payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net 
after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the 
indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund 
had never been paid. This Section 2.17(h) shall not be construed to require 
any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other 
information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the 
indemnifying party or any other Person.

(i) Indirect Tax.

(i) All payments to be made by any Credit Party under or in connection with 
any Credit Document have been calculated without regard to Indirect Tax. If 
all or part of any such payment is the consideration for a taxable supply 
or chargeable with Indirect Tax and such payment is not expressly stated to 
include Indirect Tax, then, concurrently with when the Credit Party makes 
such payment:

(A) it shall pay to the applicable Recipient an additional amount equal to 
such payment (or part) multiplied by the appropriate rate of Indirect Tax; 
and

(B) the applicable Recipient will promptly provide to such Credit Party a 
tax invoice complying with the relevant law relating to such Indirect Tax.
 
70

------------------------------------------------------------------------
If the additional amount referred to in clause (i) differs from the amount 
of Indirect Tax payable by the applicable Recipient, the parties will 
adjust the additional amount accordingly and the Recipient will promptly 
provide to the Credit Party a tax invoice or adjustment note complying with 
the relevant law relating to that Indirect Tax.

(ii) If any Credit Document requires any Credit Party to reimburse any 
Recipient for any costs or expenses, such Credit Party shall, concurrently 
with such reimbursement, pay and indemnify such Recipient against all 
Indirect Tax incurred by such Recipient in respect of the costs or expenses 
to the extent that such Recipient is not entitled to repayment or credit in 
respect of such Indirect Tax.


(j) UK Relevant Entity Provisions.

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section 2.17
, any Credit Party who is a UK Relevant Entity is not required to pay 
additional amounts to a Lender (other than a new Lender pursuant to a 
request by a Borrower under Section 2.19) pursuant to this Section 2.17 in 
respect of any Tax that is required by the United Kingdom to be withheld 
from a payment if at the time the payment falls due (i) the relevant Lender 
is not a UK Qualifying Lender and such Tax would not have been required to 
be withheld had such Lender been a UK Qualifying Lender unless the reason 
that such Lender is not a UK Qualifying Lender is a change after the date 
on which it became a Lender under this Agreement in (or in the 
interpretation, administration or application of) any law or double 
taxation agreement or any published practice or published concession of any 
relevant taxing Governmental Authority; (ii) the relevant Lender is a UK 
Qualifying Lender solely by virtue of clause (ii) of the definition of UK 
Qualifying Lender and (A) an officer of HM Revenue & Customs has given 
(and not revoked) a direction (a Direction) under section 931 of the UK 
ITA that relates to the payment, (B) such Lender has received from such 
Credit Party making such payment a certified copy of such Direction and (C) 
such payment could have been made to such Lender without any withholding or 
deduction if such Direction had not been made; (iii) the relevant Lender is 
a UK Qualifying Lender solely by virtue of paragraph (ii) of the definition 
of UK Qualifying Lender and (A) the relevant Lender has not given a UK 
Tax Confirmation to such Credit Party and (B) the payment could have been 
made to such Lender without any withholding or deduction if such Lender had 
given a UK Tax Confirmation to such Credit Party, on the basis that the UK 
Tax Confirmation would have enabled such Credit Party to have formed a 
reasonable belief that the payment was an excepted payment for the 
purpose of section 930 of the UK ITA; or (iv) the relevant Lender is a UK 
Treaty Lender and such Credit Party is able to demonstrate that such Tax is 
required to be withheld as a result of the failure of the relevant Lender 
to comply with its obligations under this Section 2.17(j)(i). Any Lender 
that is a Lender in respect of a Loan to the UK Borrower and that is not, 
or ceases to be, a UK Qualifying Lender, for whatever reason, shall 
promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the UK Borrower.

(ii) In relation to all payments to be made to a UK Treaty Lender by any 
Credit Party who is a UK Relevant Entity, such Lender shall cooperate with 
such Credit Party in completing any procedural formalities necessary for 
such Credit Party to obtain authorization to make such a payment without a 
deduction or withholding for or on
 
71

------------------------------------------------------------------------
account of UK Taxes including, to the extent applicable, making and filing 
an appropriate application for relief under a double taxation agreement. 
Nothing in this Section 2.17(j)(ii) shall require a UK Treaty Lender to (x) 
register under the HMRC DT Treaty Passport scheme or (y) apply the HMRC DT 
Treaty Passport scheme to any Loan if it has so registered.

(iii) If a UK Treaty Lender wishes the HMRC DT Treaty Passport Scheme to 
apply to this Agreement, it shall include an indication to that effect by 
including its scheme reference number and jurisdiction of tax residence 
opposite its name on Schedule 1.1(a) and the UK Borrower shall file a duly 
completed DTTP2 in respect of such Lender with HM Revenue & Customs before 
the earlier of (i) 30 days before the first interest payment date after the 
Closing Date or (ii) 30 days after the Closing Date and shall promptly 
provide such UK Treaty Lender with a copy of such filing.

(iv) Any new Lender under an Assignment and Assumption that is a UK Treaty 
Lender that holds a passport under the HMRC DT Treaty Passport Scheme, and 
which then wishes the HMRC DT Treaty Passport Scheme to apply to this 
Agreement, shall include an indication to that effect (for the benefit of 
the Administrative Agent and without liability to the UK Borrower) in such 
Assignment and Assumption by including therein its scheme reference number 
and its jurisdiction of tax residence. The UK Borrower shall file a duly 
completed form DTTP2 in respect of each new Lender that complies with the 
previous sentence with HM Revenue & Customs within 30 days after the date 
of the applicable Assignment and Assumption and shall promptly provide such 
Lender with a copy of such filing.

(k) Australian Borrower Provisions. Notwithstanding anything to the 
contrary set forth in this Section 2.17, the Australian Borrower is not 
required to pay additional amounts to a Lender (other than a new Lender 
pursuant to a request by a Borrower under Section 2.19) pursuant to this 
Section 2.17 in respect of any Tax that is required by Australia to be 
withheld from a payment:

(i) If at the time the payment falls due:

(A) the relevant Lender is not an Australian Qualifying Lender and such Tax 
would not have been required to be withheld had such Lender been an 
Australian Qualifying Lender unless the reason that such Lender is not an 
Australian Qualifying Lender is a change after the date on which it became 
a Lender under this Agreement in (or in the interpretation, administration 
or application of) any law or double taxation agreement or any published 
practice or published concession of any relevant Governmental Authority; or

(B) the relevant Lender is an Australian Treaty Lender and the Australian 
Borrower is able to demonstrate that such Tax is required to be withheld as 
a result of the failure of the relevant Lender to comply with its 
obligations under this Section 2.17(k)(i).
 
72

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Any Lender that is a Lender in respect of a Loan to the Australian Borrower 
and that is not, or ceases to be, an Australian Qualifying Lender, for 
whatever reason, shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the 
Australian Borrower. In relation to all payments to be made to an 
Australian Treaty Lender by the Australian Borrower, such Lender shall 
cooperate, to the extent it is able to do so, with the Australian Borrower 
in completing any procedural formalities necessary for the Australian 
Borrower to obtain authorization to make such a payment without a deduction 
or withholding for or on account of Australian Taxes including, to the 
extent applicable, making and filing an appropriate application for relief 
under a double taxation agreement; or

(ii) to the extent that the relevant deduction or withholding would not 
have arisen if the Lender had provided the Australian Borrower with its tax 
file number, Australian Business Number or other exemption details.

(l) Each partys obligations under this Section 2.17 shall survive the 
resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of 
rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the 
Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations 
under any Credit Document.

(m) Solely for purposes of determining withholding Taxes imposed under 
FATCA, from and after the Closing Date, the Borrowers and the 
Administrative Agent shall treat (and the Lenders hereby authorize the 
Administrative Agent to treat) the Credit Agreement as not qualifying as a 
grandfathered obligation within the meaning of Treasury Regulation 
Section 1.1471-2(b)(2)(i).

2.18 Compensation. Each Borrower will compensate each Lender upon demand 
for all losses, expenses and liabilities (including any loss, expense or 
liability incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits 
or other funds required by such Lender to fund or maintain LIBOR Loans, but 
excluding any lost profits) that such Lender may incur or sustain (i) if 
for any reason (other than a default by such Lender) a Borrowing or 
continuation of, or conversion into, a LIBOR Loan to such Borrower does not 
occur on a date specified therefor in a Notice of Borrowing or Notice of 
Conversion/Continuation as a result of any action or inaction by a 
Borrower; (ii) if any repayment, prepayment or conversion of any LIBOR Loan 
to such Borrower occurs on a date other than the last day of an Interest 
Period applicable thereto (including as a consequence of any assignment 
made pursuant to Section 2.19(a) or any acceleration of the maturity of the 
Loans pursuant to Section 9.2); (iii) if any prepayment of any LIBOR Loan 
to such Borrower is not made on any date specified in a notice of 
prepayment given by such Borrower; or (iv) as a consequence of any other 
failure by such Borrower to make any payments with respect to any LIBOR 
Loan to such Borrower when due hereunder. Calculation of all amounts 
payable to a Lender under this Section 2.18 shall be made as though such 
Lender had actually funded its relevant LIBOR Loan through the purchase of 
a Eurodollar deposit bearing interest at the LIBOR Rate in an amount equal 
to the amount of such LIBOR Loan, having a maturity comparable to the 
relevant Interest Period; provided, however, that each Lender may fund its 
LIBOR Loans in any manner it sees fit and the foregoing assumption shall be 
utilized only for the calculation of amounts payable under this Section 
2.18. A certificate (which shall be in reasonable detail) showing the bases 
for the determinations set forth in this Section 2.18 by any Lender as to 
any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.18
 
73

------------------------------------------------------------------------
shall be submitted by such Lender to the applicable Borrower either 
directly or through the Administrative Agent. Determinations set forth in 
any such certificate made in good faith for purposes of this Section 2.18 
of any such losses, expenses or liabilities shall be conclusive absent 
manifest error.


2.19 Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.

(a) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.16, or requires any 
Borrower to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender 
or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to 
Section 2.17, then such Lender shall (at the request of such Borrower) use 
reasonable efforts to designate a different Lending Office for funding or 
booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations 
hereunder to another of its offices, branches or Affiliates, if, in the 
judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate 
or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.16 or 2.17, as the case may 
be, in the future, and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any 
unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to 
such Lender. Each Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and 
expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or 
assignment requested by it.

(b) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.16, or if any 
Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to 
any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender 
pursuant Section 2.17, and, in each case, such Lender has declined or is 
unable to designate a different Lending Office in accordance with Section 
2.19(a), or if any Lender is a Defaulting Lender or a Non-Consenting 
Lender, then Crawford may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to 
such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and 
delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the 
restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section 11.6), all of 
its interests, rights (other than its existing rights to payments pursuant 
to Section 2.16 or 2.17) and obligations under this Agreement and the other 
Credit Documents to an Eligible Assignee that shall assume such obligations 
(which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such 
assignment); provided that:

(i) Crawford shall have paid to the Administrative Agent the assignment fee 
(if any) specified in Section 11.6(b)(iv);

(ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the 
outstanding principal of its Loans and any funded participations in Letters 
of Credit and Swingline Loans not refinanced through a Borrowing of 
Revolving Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other 
amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Credit Documents 
(including any amounts under Section 2.18) from the assignee (to the extent 
of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the 
applicable Borrower (in the case of all other amounts);

(iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a request for 
compensation under Section 2.16 or payments required to be made pursuant to 
Section 2.17, such assignment will result in a reduction in such 
compensation or payments thereafter;
 
74

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(iv) such assignment does not conflict with applicable Requirements of Law; 
and

(v) in the case of any assignment resulting from a Lender becoming a Non- 
Consenting Lender, the applicable assignee shall have consented to the 
applicable amendment, waiver or consent.

A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation 
if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the 
circumstances entitling Crawford to require such assignment and delegation 
cease to apply. In the event any Lender fails to execute the assignment in 
connection with an assignment pursuant to this Section 2.19, the 
Administrative Agent may, but is not required to, upon two Business Days 
prior notice to such Lender, execute such assignment on behalf of such 
Lender (provided that such Lender has received all amounts to which it is 
entitled under this Section 2.19), and each Lender hereby grants to the 
Administrative Agent an irrevocable power of attorney (which shall be 
coupled with an interest) for such purpose.


2.20 Defaulting Lenders.
 
(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, 
if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as such 
Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by 
applicable law:

(i) Such Defaulting Lenders right to approve or disapprove any amendment, 
waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as set 
forth in the definition of Required Lenders and in Section 11.5.

(ii) Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by 
the Administrative Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender (whether 
voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Article IX or otherwise) 
or received by the Administrative Agent from such Defaulting Lender 
pursuant to Section 9.3 shall be applied at such time or times as may be 
determined by the Administrative Agent as follows:

(A) first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to 
the Administrative Agent hereunder;

(B) second, to the payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts owing by such 
Defaulting Lender to the Issuing Banks or the Swingline Lender hereunder;

(C) third, to Cash Collateralize the Fronting Exposure of the Issuing Banks 
and the Swingline Lender with respect to such Defaulting Lender;

(D) fourth, if so determined by the Administrative Agent or requested by 
any Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, but without duplication of the 
Cash Collateralization described in clause (C) above, to be held as Cash 
Collateral for future funding obligations of such Defaulting Lender in 
respect of any participation in any Letter of Credit or Swingline Loan;
 
75

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(E) fifth, as Crawford may request (so long as no Default exists), to the 
funding of any Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed 
to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by 
the Administrative Agent;

(F) sixth, if so determined by the Administrative Agent and Crawford, to be 
held in a non-interest bearing deposit account and released in order to 
satisfy obligations of such Defaulting Lender to fund Loans under this 
Agreement;

(G) seventh, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders, any 
Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender as a result of any judgment of a court 
of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender, any Issuing Bank or the 
Swingline Lender against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such 
Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under this Agreement;

(H) eighth, so long as no Default exists, to the payment of any amounts 
owing to any Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent 
jurisdiction obtained by such Borrower against such Defaulting Lender as a 
result of such Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under this 
Agreement; and

(I) ninth, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of 
competent jurisdiction;

provided that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of 
any Loans or any L/C Exposure in respect of which such Defaulting Lender 
has not fully funded its appropriate share, and (y) such Loans were made or 
the related Letters of Credit were issued at a time when the conditions set 
forth in Section 4.2 were satisfied or waived, then such payment shall be 
applied solely to pay the Loans of, and obligations in respect of Letters 
of Credit owed to, all non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to 
being applied to the payment of any Loans of, or obligations in respect of 
Letters of Credit owed to, such Defaulting Lender. Any payments, 
prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that 
are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post 
Cash Collateral pursuant to this Section 2.20(a)(ii) shall be deemed paid 
by the applicable Borrower to such Defaulting Lender for the applicable 
Obligations owing by such Borrower to such Defaulting Lender and redirected 
by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.


(iii) Certain Fees.

(A) No Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive any commitment fee 
pursuant to Section 2.9(a)(ii) for any period during which such Lender is a 
Defaulting Lender (and Crawford shall not be required to pay any such fee 
that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to such 
Defaulting Lender).
 
76

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(B) Each Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive the letter of 
credit fee pursuant to Section 2.9(b)(i) for any period during which such 
Lender is a Defaulting Lender only to the extent allocable to its ratable 
share of the Stated Amount of Letters of Credit for which it has provided 
Cash Collateral pursuant to Section 2.20(c).

(C) With respect to any letter of credit fee not required to be paid to any 
Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.20(a)(iii)(B), the applicable 
Borrower shall (x) pay to each Non-Defaulting Lender that portion of any 
such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender with respect to such 
Defaulting Lenders L/C Exposure that has been reallocated to such 
Non-Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.20(a)(iv), (y) pay to the 
applicable Issuing Bank the amount of any such fee otherwise payable to 
such Defaulting Lender to the extent allocable to such Issuing Banks 
Fronting Exposure to such Defaulting Lender and (z) not be required to pay 
the remaining amount of any such fee.

(iv) All or any part of such Defaulting Lenders L/C Exposure and Swingline 
Exposure shall automatically (effective on the day such Lender becomes a 
Defaulting Lender) be reallocated among the non-Defaulting Lenders in 
accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages (calculated without 
regard to such Defaulting Lenders Commitment) but only to the extent that 
such reallocation does not cause the Credit Exposure of any non-Defaulting 
Lender to exceed such non-Defaulting Lenders Commitment. Subject to 
Section 11.22, no reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or 
release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender 
arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any 
claim of a non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such non-Defaulting 
Lenders increased exposure following such reallocation.

(v) If the reallocation described in Section 2.20(a)(iv) cannot, or can 
only partially, be effected, the applicable Borrower shall, without 
prejudice to any right or remedy available to it hereunder or under law, 
within two Business Days following notice by the Administrative Agent, Cash 
Collateralize such Defaulting Lenders L/C Exposure and its Swingline 
Exposure (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to 
Section 2.20(a)(iv)) in accordance with the procedures set forth in 
Section 2.20(c).

(b) If each Borrower, the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Bank and the 
Swingline Lender agree in writing in their sole discretion that a 
Defaulting Lender should no longer be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender, the 
Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the 
effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set 
forth therein (which may include arrangements with respect to any Cash 
Collateral), such Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par 
that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take such other 
actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause 
the Revolving Loans and funded and unfunded participations in Letters of 
Credit and Swingline Loans to be held on a pro rata basis by the Lenders in 
accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages (without giving 
effect to Section 2.20(a)(iv)), whereupon such Lender will cease to be a 
Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively 
with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of any 
Borrower while such
 
77

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lender was a Defaulting Lender; provided further that, except to the extent 
otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder 
from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any 
claim of any party hereunder arising from such Lenders having been a 
Defaulting Lender.

(c) At any time that there shall exist a Defaulting Lender, within two 
Business Days upon the written request of the Administrative Agent, any 
Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, the applicable Borrower shall deliver 
to the Administrative Agent Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to 
cover all Fronting Exposure (after giving effect to Section 2.20(a)(iv) 
and any Cash Collateral provided by the Defaulting Lender, which such 
Defaulting Lender may provide in its discretion).

(i) All Cash Collateral (other than credit support not comprising funds 
subject to deposit) shall be maintained in blocked, non-interest bearing 
deposit accounts with the Administrative Agent. Each Borrower, and to the 
extent provided by any Lender, such Lender, hereby grants to (and subjects 
to the control of) the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the 
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders (including the 
Swingline Lender), and agrees to maintain, a first priority security 
interest in all such cash, deposit accounts and all balances therein, and 
all other property so provided as collateral pursuant hereto, and in all 
proceeds of the foregoing, all as security for the obligations to which 
such Cash Collateral may be applied pursuant to Section 2.20(c)(ii). If at 
any time the Administrative Agent determines that Cash Collateral is 
subject to any right or claim of any Person other than the Administrative 
Agent as herein provided, or that the total amount of such Cash Collateral 
is less than the applicable Fronting Exposure and other obligations secured 
thereby, the applicable Borrower or the relevant Defaulting Lender will, 
promptly upon demand by the Administrative Agent, pay or provide to the 
Administrative Agent additional Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to 
eliminate such deficiency.

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, 
Cash Collateral provided under this Section 2.20 in respect of Letters of 
Credit or Swingline Loans shall be held and applied to the satisfaction of 
the specific L/C Exposure or Swingline Loans, obligations to fund 
participations therein (including, as to Cash Collateral provided by a 
Defaulting Lender, any interest accrued on such obligation) and other 
obligations for which the Cash Collateral was so provided, prior to any 
other application of such property as may be provided for herein. Without 
limiting the foregoing, any Cash Collateral provided pursuant to this 
Section 2.20(c) by any Foreign Subsidiary Borrower shall only secure L/C 
Exposure related to Letters of Credit issued for the account of a Foreign 
Subsidiary and Swingline Loans made to a Foreign Subsidiary Borrower.

(iii) Cash Collateral (or the appropriate portion thereof) provided to 
reduce Fronting Exposure or other obligations shall be released promptly 
following (i) the elimination of the applicable Fronting Exposure or other 
obligations giving rise thereto (including by the termination of Defaulting 
Lender status of the applicable Lender (or, as appropriate, its assignee)) 
or (ii) the Administrative Agents good faith determination that there 
exists excess Cash Collateral; provided, however, that (x) Cash Collateral 
furnished
 
78

------------------------------------------------------------------------
by or on behalf of a Credit Party shall not be released during the 
continuance of a Default (and following application as provided in this 
Section 2.20 may be otherwise applied in accordance with Section 2.15) and 
(y) the Person providing Cash Collateral and the applicable Issuing Bank or 
Swingline Lender, as applicable, may agree that Cash Collateral shall not 
be released but instead held to support future anticipated Fronting 
Exposure or other obligations.

(d) So long as any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, (i) the Swingline Lender 
shall not be required to fund any Swingline Loans unless it is satisfied 
that it will have no Fronting Exposure after giving effect to such 
Swingline Loan and (ii) no Issuing Bank shall be required to issue, extend, 
renew or increase any Letter of Credit unless it is satisfied that it will 
have no Fronting Exposure after giving effect thereto.


2.21 Increase in Commitments.

(a) From time to time on and after the Closing Date and prior to the 
Termination Date, Crawford may, upon at least 30 days notice to the 
Administrative Agent (which shall promptly provide a copy of such notice to 
the Lenders), propose to increase the aggregate amount of the Commitments 
by an amount which (i) is not less than $25,000,000 and, if greater, an 
integral multiple of $5,000,000 in excess thereof, with respect to any such 
request and (ii) when aggregated with all prior and concurrent increases in 
the Commitments pursuant to this Section 2.21, is not in excess of 
$200,000,000. Crawford may increase the aggregate amount of the Commitments 
by (x) having another lender or lenders (each, an Additional Lender) 
become party to this Agreement (subject to the consent of the 
Administrative Agent and each Issuing Bank (such consent not to be 
unreasonably withheld or delayed)), (y) agreeing with any Lender (with the 
consent of such Lender in its sole discretion) to increase its Commitment 
hereunder (each, an Increasing Lender) or (z) a combination of the 
procedures described in clauses (x) and (y) above; provided that no Lender 
shall be obligated to increase its Commitment without its consent.

(b) Any increase in the Commitments pursuant to this Section 2.21 shall be 
subject to satisfaction of the following conditions:

(i) Each Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a certificate 
dated as of the applicable increase date duly executed by an Authorized 
Officer of such Borrower certifying and attaching the resolutions adopted 
by such Borrower approving or consenting to such increase;

(ii) Each of the representations and warranties contained in Article V 
qualified as to materiality shall be true and correct and those not so 
qualified shall be true and correct in all material respects, in each case 
on and as of the date of such increase with the same effect as if made on 
and as of such date, both immediately before and after giving effect to 
such increase (except to the extent any such representation or warranty is 
expressly stated to have been made as of a specific date, in which case 
such representation or warranty shall be true and correct as of such date);
 
79

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(iii) Immediately after giving effect to such increase and any Indebtedness 
to be incurred in connection therewith, Crawford shall be in compliance 
with the financial covenants set forth in Article VII (determined on a Pro 
Forma Basis for the Reference Period then most recently ended for which 
Crawford has delivered the financial statements required by Section 6.1 
(and a Compliance Certificate)); and

(iv) At the time of such increase, no Default or Event of Default shall 
have occurred and be continuing or would immediately result from such 
increase.

(c) Upon any increase in the amount of the Commitments pursuant to this 
Section 2.21 (each, an Additional Commitment):

(i) Each Additional Lender and Increasing Lender shall enter into a Joinder 
Agreement pursuant to which such Additional Lender or Increasing Lender 
shall, as of the effective date of such increase, undertake an Additional 
Commitment (or, in the case of an Increasing Lender, pursuant to which such 
Increasing Lenders Commitment shall be increased in the agreed amount on 
such date) and such Additional Lender shall thereupon become (or, if an 
Increasing Lender, continue to be) a Lender for all purposes hereof.

(ii) Each Borrower shall, as applicable, in coordination with the 
Administrative Agent, repay outstanding Loans and incur additional Loans 
from other Lenders, pursuant to a reallocation agreement or otherwise, so 
that the Lenders participate in each Borrowing pro rata on the basis of 
their respective Commitments (after giving effect to any increase in the 
Commitments pursuant to this Section 2.21). Amounts payable under Section 
2.18 as a result of the actions required to be taken under this Section 
2.21 shall be paid in full by the applicable Borrower or Borrowers.

(iii) If any such Additional Lender is a Foreign Lender, such Additional 
Lender shall deliver the forms required by Section 2.17.

(d) Each Additional Commitment shall be made on the same terms as the 
Commitments in existence immediately prior to the date of such Additional 
Commitment; provided, however, that (i) the interest rates, commitment fees 
and upfront fees payable (collectively, the Financing Terms) pursuant to 
an Additional Commitment may be different than those payable pursuant to 
the Commitments in existence immediately prior to the date of such 
Additional Commitment (such Commitments, the Existing Commitments); (ii) 
all Additional Commitments made in connection with a single request by 
Crawford in accordance with Section 2.21(a) shall be made on the same 
Financing Terms; and (iii) if any Additional Commitment is made on 
Financing Terms more favorable (to the applicable Lender) than are the 
Financing Terms of the Existing Commitments, then the Financing Terms of 
the Existing Commitments shall be automatically increased to the extent 
necessary to equal the Financing Terms of such Additional Commitment, and 
each Borrower agrees to execute any amendments and take any other actions 
that are reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent to document such 
increase; provided further that, in determining the Financing Terms of any 
Additional Commitment or the Existing Commitments, (x) upfront fees payable 
under the Existing Commitments or any Additional Commitment in the initial 
primary syndication thereof
 
80

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(with such upfront fees being equated to interest based on an assumed 
five-year life-to-maturity) and the effects of any and all interest rate 
floors shall be included; and (y) customary arrangement or commitment fees 
payable to the Arrangers or any of their respective Affiliates in 
connection with the Existing Commitments or to one or more arrangers or 
their respective Affiliates in connection with any Additional Commitment 
shall be excluded.

2.22 Amend and Extend Transactions. At any time after the Closing Date, the 
Borrowers and any Lender may agree, by notice to the Administrative Agent 
(each such notice, an Extension Notice), to extend the Maturity Date of 
such Lenders Commitment to the extended maturity date specified in such 
Extension Notice; provided that (i) the Borrowers shall have offered to all 
Lenders the opportunity to participate in such extension on a pro rata 
basis and on the same terms and conditions to each such Lender; (ii) no 
Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing prior to 
or immediately after giving effect to any such extension; (iii) except as 
to interest rates, fees and final maturity date, the extended Commitments 
shall have the same terms as the Commitments as of the date of such 
Extension Notice; (iv) after giving effect to any such extension, there 
shall be no more than two separate Maturity Dates in effect for all 
Commitments; and (v) all documentation in respect of such extension shall 
be consistent with the foregoing and in form and substance reasonably 
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers. In connection 
with any such extension, the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent, with 
the approval of the extending Lenders, may effect such amendments to this 
Agreement and the other Credit Documents as may be necessary or 
appropriate, in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent and 
Crawford, to establish new tranches or sub-tranches in respect of the 
Commitments so extended and such technical amendments as may be necessary 
or appropriate in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent and 
Crawford in connection with the establishment of such new tranches or 
sub-tranches (including to preserve the pro rata treatment of the extended 
and non-extended tranches), in each case on terms consistent with this 
Section 2.22. Any extension of the Commitments shall require the consent of 
each Issuing Bank and the Swingline Lender to the extent that such 
extension provides for the issuance of Letters of Credit or the borrowing 
of Swingline Loans at any time during such extended period.


ARTICLE III

LETTERS OF CREDIT

3.1 Issuance. Subject to and upon the terms and conditions herein set 
forth, so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is 
continuing, any Issuing Bank will, at any time and from time to time on and 
after the Closing Date and prior to the earlier of (i) the L/C Maturity 
Date and (ii) the Termination Date, and upon request by Crawford on behalf 
of a Borrower in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.2, issue for 
the account of such Borrower or its Subsidiaries one or more irrevocable 
standby or commercial letters of credit denominated in any Currency and in 
a form customarily used or otherwise approved by such Issuing Bank 
(together with all amendments, modifications and supplements thereto, 
substitutions therefor and renewals and restatements thereof, and together 
with the Existing Letters of Credit, collectively, the Letters of Credit
); provided that any Letter of Credit requested to be issued for the 
account of a Foreign Subsidiary must be requested by a Foreign Subsidiary 
Borrower (it being understood that such request may be made by Crawford on 
behalf
 
81

------------------------------------------------------------------------
of such Foreign Subsidiary Borrower). The Stated Amount of each Letter of 
Credit shall not be less than $100,000, or such lesser amount as may be 
acceptable to the applicable Issuing Bank. Notwithstanding the foregoing:

(a) No Letter of Credit shall be issued for the account of a Borrower or 
its Subsidiaries if, after giving effect to such issuance, (i) the Dollar 
Amount of the Stated Amount of such Letter of Credit, when added to the 
aggregate L/C Exposure of the Lenders at such time, would exceed the L/C 
Subcommitment; (ii) the Dollar Amount of the Stated Amount of such Letter 
of Credit, when added to the Aggregate Credit Exposure, would exceed the 
aggregate Commitments at such time; (iii) the Dollar Amount of the Stated 
Amount of such Letter of Credit, when added to the Credit Extended to such 
Borrower at such time, would exceed such Borrowers Sublimit; or (iv) any 
Lender is at that time a Defaulting Lender, unless the applicable Issuing 
Bank has entered into an arrangement, including the delivery of Cash 
Collateral, satisfactory to such Issuing Bank (in its sole discretion) with 
such Borrower or such Lender to eliminate such Issuing Banks actual or 
potential Fronting Exposure (after giving effect to Section 2.20(a)(iv)) 
with respect to such Defaulting Lender arising from either the Letter of 
Credit then proposed to be issued or such Letter of Credit and all other 
L/C Exposure as to which such Issuing Bank has actual or potential Fronting 
Exposure, as reasonably determined by such Issuing Bank;

(b) Notwithstanding that a Letter of Credit issued or outstanding hereunder 
is in support of any obligations of, or is for the account of, or otherwise 
will benefit, a Subsidiary of any Borrower, such Borrower shall be 
obligated to reimburse the applicable Issuing Bank hereunder for any and 
all drawings under such Letter of Credit (and each Borrower hereby 
acknowledges that the issuance of Letters of Credit for the benefit of its 
Subsidiaries inures to the benefit of such Borrower and that such 
Borrowers business derives substantial benefits from the businesses of 
such Subsidiaries);

(c) No Letter of Credit shall be issued that by its terms expires later 
than one year after the Maturity Date or, in any event, more than one year 
after its date of issuance; provided, however, that (i) a Letter of Credit 
may, if requested by a Borrower, provide by its terms, and on terms 
acceptable to the applicable Issuing Bank, for renewal for successive 
periods of one year or less (but not beyond the date that is one year after 
the Maturity Date), unless and until the applicable Issuing Bank shall have 
delivered a notice of nonrenewal to the beneficiary of such Letter of 
Credit (an Auto-Extension Letter of Credit), (ii) any Auto-Extension 
Letter of Credit must permit the applicable Issuing Bank to prevent any 
such extension at least once in each 12-month period (commencing with the 
date of issuance of such Letter of Credit) by giving prior notice to the 
beneficiary thereof not later than a day (the Non-Extension Notice Date) 
in each such 12-month period to be agreed upon at the time such Letter of 
Credit is issued, (iii) unless otherwise directed by the applicable Issuing 
Bank, Crawford or the applicable Borrower shall not be required to make a 
specific request to the applicable Issuing Bank for any such extension of 
an Auto-Extension Letter of Credit, and (iv) once an Auto-Extension Letter 
of Credit has been issued, the Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized 
(but may not require) the applicable Issuing Bank to permit the extension 
of such Letter of Credit at any time to an expiry date not later than the 
expiration date of such Letter of Credit, except that the applicable 
Issuing Bank shall not permit any such extension if (A) such Issuing Bank 
has determined that it would not be permitted, or would have no obligation 
at such time, to issue such Letter of Credit in its revised
 
82

------------------------------------------------------------------------
form (as extended) under the terms hereof, or (B) it has received notice 
(which may be by telephone or in writing) on or before the day that is 
seven Business Days before the Non-Extension Notice Date (1) from the 
Administrative Agent that the Required Lenders have elected not to permit 
such extension or (2) from the Administrative Agent, any Revolving Lender, 
Crawford or the applicable Borrower that one or more of the applicable 
conditions specified in Section 4.2 is not then satisfied, and in each such 
case directing the applicable Issuing Bank not to permit such extension; 
provided further that any Letter of Credit each Letter of Credit with an 
expiry date after the L/C Maturity Date shall be subject to Section 3.12;

(d) No Issuing Bank shall be under any obligation to issue any Letter of 
Credit if, at the time of such proposed issuance, (i) any order, judgment 
or decree of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator shall purport by its 
terms to enjoin or restrain such Issuing Bank from issuing such Letter of 
Credit, or any Requirement of Law applicable to such Issuing Bank or any 
request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any 
Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over such Issuing Bank shall 
prohibit, or request that such Issuing Bank refrain from, the issuance of 
letters of credit generally or such Letter of Credit in particular or shall 
impose upon such Issuing Bank with respect to such Letter of Credit any 
restriction or reserve or capital requirement (for which such Issuing Bank 
is not otherwise compensated) not in effect on the Closing Date, or any 
unreimbursed loss, cost or expense that was not applicable, in effect or 
known to such Issuing Bank as of the Closing Date and that such Issuing 
Bank in good faith deems material to it, or (ii) such Issuing Bank shall 
have actual knowledge, or shall have received notice from any Lender, prior 
to the issuance of such Letter of Credit that one or more of the conditions 
specified in Section 4.1 (if applicable) or 4.2 are not then satisfied (or 
have not been waived in writing as required herein) or that the issuance of 
such Letter of Credit would violate the provisions of Section 3.1(a); and

(e) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, all 
Letters of Credit issued under this Agreement shall be issued by Wells 
Fargo, Bank of America, N.A., or such other Lender as approved by the 
Administrative Agent and Crawford (in accordance with the definition of 
Issuing Bank hereunder).

3.2 Notices. Whenever any Borrower desires the issuance of a Letter of 
Credit, Crawford shall give any Issuing Bank written notice on behalf of 
such Borrower (and each Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally 
authorizes Crawford to give any such notice from time to time in any form 
or substance as permitted under this Section 3.2) with a copy to the 
Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m., Charlotte time, three 
Business Days (or such shorter period as is acceptable to such Issuing Bank 
in any given case) prior to the requested date of issuance thereof. Each 
such notice (each, a Letter of Credit Notice) shall be irrevocable, shall 
be given in the form of a Letter of Credit Application and shall specify 
(i) the requested date of issuance, which shall be a Business Day, (ii) the 
requested Stated Amount, Currency and expiry date of the Letter of Credit 
and (iii) the name and address of the requested beneficiary or 
beneficiaries of the Letter of Credit. The applicable Borrower shall also 
complete any application procedures and documents reasonably required by 
the applicable Issuing Bank in connection with the issuance of any Letter 
of Credit. Upon its issuance of any Letter of Credit, the applicable 
Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent of such 
issuance, and the Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to 
each Lender. The renewal or extension of any outstanding Letter of Credit 
shall, for purposes of this Article III, be treated in all respects as the 
issuance of a new Letter of Credit.
 
83

------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.3 Participations. Immediately upon the issuance of any Letter of Credit, 
the applicable Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have sold and transferred to 
each Lender, and each Lender shall be deemed irrevocably and 
unconditionally to have purchased and received from such Issuing Bank, 
without recourse or warranty (except for the absence of Liens thereon 
created, incurred or suffered to exist by, through or under such Issuing 
Bank), an undivided interest and participation, pro rata (based on its 
Applicable Percentage), in such Letter of Credit, each drawing made 
thereunder and the obligations of the applicable Borrower under this 
Agreement with respect thereto and any Collateral or other security 
therefor or guaranty pertaining thereto; provided, however, that the fee 
relating to Letters of Credit described in Section 2.9(b)(ii) shall be 
payable directly to such Issuing Bank as provided therein, and the other 
Lenders shall have no right to receive any portion thereof. In 
consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Lender hereby 
absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, 
for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank, on the Lender L/C 
Obligation Payment Date, such Lenders Applicable Percentage of each 
Reimbursement Obligation (plus interest thereon) not reimbursed by the 
applicable Borrower on the applicable Reimbursement Obligation Repayment 
Date as provided in Section 3.4 or through the Borrowing of Revolving Loans 
as provided in Section 3.5 (because the conditions set forth in Section 4.2 
cannot be satisfied, or for any other reason), or of any reimbursement 
payment required to be refunded to such Borrower for any reason. Upon any 
change in the Commitments of any of the Lenders pursuant to Section 2.21 
or 11.6(a), with respect to all outstanding Letters of Credit and 
Reimbursement Obligations there shall be an automatic adjustment to the 
participations pursuant to this Section 3.3 to reflect the new Applicable 
Percentages of the Lenders. Each Lenders obligation to make payment to an 
Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section 3.3 shall be absolute and 
unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, 
including the termination of the Commitments or the existence of any 
Default or Event of Default, and each such payment shall be made without 
any offset, abatement, reduction or withholding whatsoever.

3.4 Reimbursement. Each Borrower hereby agrees to reimburse the applicable 
Issuing Bank by making payment to the Administrative Agent, for the account 
of such Issuing Bank, in immediately available funds, for any payment made 
by such Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit (each such amount so paid 
until reimbursed, together with interest thereon payable as provided 
hereinbelow, a Reimbursement Obligation) on the Reimbursement Obligation 
Repayment Date (provided that any such Reimbursement Obligation shall be 
deemed timely satisfied (but nevertheless subject to the payment of 
interest thereon as provided hereinbelow) if satisfied pursuant to a 
Borrowing of Revolving Loans made on the date of such payment by such 
Issuing Bank, as set forth more completely in Section 3.5), together with 
interest on the amount so paid by such Issuing Bank, to the extent not 
reimbursed prior to 2:00 p.m., Charlotte time, on the date of such payment 
or disbursement, for the period from the date of the respective payment to 
the date the Reimbursement Obligation created thereby is satisfied, at the 
Adjusted Base Rate (or, if such Reimbursement Obligation is denominated in 
a Foreign Currency, the Adjusted LIBOR Rate applicable to such Currency for 
an Interest Period of one month) as in effect from time to time during such 
period, such interest also to be payable on demand. Each Issuing Bank shall 
provide the Administrative Agent and the applicable Borrower
 
84

------------------------------------------------------------------------
with prompt notice of any payment or disbursement made or to be made under 
any Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank, although the failure to 
give, or any delay in giving, any such notice shall not release, diminish 
or otherwise affect such Borrowers obligations under this Section 3.4 or 
any other provision of this Agreement. The Administrative Agent shall 
promptly pay to the applicable Issuing Bank any such amounts received by it 
under this Section 3.4.

3.5 Payment by Revolving Loans. In the event that any Issuing Bank makes 
any payment under any Letter of Credit and the applicable Borrower shall 
not have timely satisfied in full its Reimbursement Obligation to such 
Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 3.4, and to the extent that any amounts 
then held in the Cash Collateral Account established pursuant to Section 
3.8 shall be insufficient to satisfy in full such Reimbursement Obligation 
(plus any accrued interest thereon), such Issuing Bank shall promptly 
notify the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent shall 
promptly notify each Lender, of such failure. Each Lender shall make 
available to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the applicable 
Issuing Bank, its Applicable Percentage of such Reimbursement Obligation 
(plus interest thereon to the Lender L/C Obligation Payment Date) on or 
before the Lender L/C Obligation Payment Date. If and to the extent any 
Lender shall not have so made its Applicable Percentage of the amount of 
such payment available to the Administrative Agent, such Lender agrees to 
pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the applicable Issuing 
Bank, forthwith on demand such amount, together with interest thereon at 
the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the 
Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank 
compensation for each day from the Lender L/C Obligation Payment Date until 
the date such amount is paid to the Administrative Agent. The failure of 
any Lender to make available to the Administrative Agent its Applicable 
Percentage of any payment under any Letter of Credit shall not relieve any 
other Lender of its obligation hereunder to make available to the 
Administrative Agent its Applicable Percentage of any payment under any 
Letter of Credit on the date required, as specified above, but no Lender 
shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make available 
to the Administrative Agent such other Lenders Applicable Percentage of 
any such payment. Each such payment by a Lender under this Section 3.5 of 
its Applicable Percentage of an amount paid by an Issuing Bank shall 
constitute a Revolving Loan by such Lender (the applicable Borrower being 
deemed to have given a timely Notice of Borrowing therefor) and shall be 
treated as such for all purposes of this Agreement; provided that, for 
purposes of determining the aggregate Unutilized Commitments immediately 
prior to giving effect to the application of the proceeds of such Revolving 
Loans, the Reimbursement Obligation being satisfied thereby shall be deemed 
not to be outstanding at such time. Each Lenders obligation to make 
Revolving Loans pursuant to this Section 3.5 shall be absolute and 
unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, 
including the failure of the amount of such Borrowing of Revolving Loans to 
meet any minimum Borrowing amount specified in Section 2.2(b); provided, 
however, that each Lenders obligation to make Revolving Loans pursuant to 
this Section 3.5 is subject to the conditions set forth in Section 4.2 
(other than delivery by any Borrower of a Notice of Borrowing).

3.6 Payment to Lenders. Whenever any Issuing Bank receives a payment in 
respect of a Reimbursement Obligation as to which the Administrative Agent 
has received, for the account of such Issuing Bank, any payments from the 
Lenders pursuant to Section 3.3 or 3.5, such Issuing Bank shall promptly 
pay to the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent shall 
promptly pay to each Lender that has paid its Applicable Percentage 
thereof, in
 
85

------------------------------------------------------------------------
immediately available funds in the appropriate Currency, an amount equal to 
such Lenders ratable share (based on the proportionate amount funded by 
such Lender to the aggregate amount funded by all Lenders) of such 
Reimbursement Obligation.

3.7 Obligations Absolute. The Reimbursement Obligations of each Borrower 
shall be irrevocable, shall remain in effect until the applicable Issuing 
Bank shall have no further obligations to make any payments or 
disbursements under any circumstances with respect to any Letter of Credit, 
and shall be absolute and unconditional, shall not be subject to 
counterclaim, setoff or other defense or any other qualification or 
exception whatsoever and shall be made in accordance with the terms and 
conditions of this Agreement under all circumstances, including any of the 
following circumstances:

(a) Any lack of validity or enforceability of this Agreement, any of the 
other Credit Documents or any documents or instruments relating to any 
Letter of Credit;

(b) Any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other 
term of, all or any of the Obligations in respect of any Letter of Credit 
or any other amendment, modification or waiver of or any consent to 
departure from any Letter of Credit or any documents or instruments 
relating thereto, in each case whether or not the applicable Borrower has 
notice or knowledge thereof;

(c) The existence of any claim, setoff, defense or other right that the 
applicable Borrower may have at any time against a beneficiary named in a 
Letter of Credit, any transferee of any Letter of Credit (or any Person for 
whom any such transferee may be acting), the Administrative Agent, any 
Security Trustee, any Issuing Bank, any Lender, any other Borrower or any 
other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, any Letter of 
Credit, the transactions contemplated hereby or any unrelated transactions 
(including any underlying transaction between the applicable Borrower and 
the beneficiary named in any such Letter of Credit);

(d) Any draft, certificate or any other document presented under the Letter 
of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any 
respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect 
(provided that such draft, certificate or other document appears on its 
face to substantially comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit), any 
errors, omissions, interruptions or delays in transmission or delivery of 
any messages, by mail, facsimile or otherwise, or any errors in translation 
or in interpretation of technical terms;

(e) Any defense based upon the failure of any drawing under a Letter of 
Credit to conform to the terms of the Letter of Credit (provided that any 
draft, certificate or other document presented pursuant to such Letter of 
Credit appears on its face to substantially comply with the terms thereof), 
any nonapplication or misapplication by the beneficiary or any transferee 
of the proceeds of such drawing or any other act or omission of such 
beneficiary or transferee in connection with such Letter of Credit;

(f) The exchange, release, surrender or impairment of any Collateral or 
other security for the Obligations;

(g) The occurrence of any Default or Event of Default; or
 
86

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(h) Any other circumstance or event whatsoever, including any other 
circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a 
discharge of, any Borrower or Subsidiary Guarantor.

Any action taken or omitted to be taken by any Issuing Bank under or in 
connection with any Letter of Credit, if taken or omitted in the absence of 
gross negligence or willful misconduct, shall be binding upon each Borrower 
and Lender and shall not create or result in any liability of such Issuing 
Bank to any Borrower or Lender. It is expressly understood and agreed that, 
for purposes of determining whether a wrongful payment under a Letter of 
Credit resulted from an Issuing Banks gross negligence or willful 
misconduct, (i) such Issuing Banks acceptance of documents that appear on 
their face to substantially comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit, 
without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice 
or information to the contrary, (ii) such Issuing Banks exclusive reliance 
on the documents presented to it under such Letter of Credit as to any and 
all matters set forth therein, including the amount of any draft presented 
under such Letter of Credit, whether or not the amount due to the 
beneficiary thereunder equals the amount of such draft and whether or not 
any document presented pursuant to such Letter of Credit proves to be 
insufficient in any respect (so long as such document appears on its face 
to substantially comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit), and 
whether or not any other statement or any other document presented pursuant 
to such Letter of Credit proves to be forged or invalid or any statement 
therein proves to be inaccurate or untrue in any respect whatsoever, and 
(iii) any noncompliance in any immaterial respect of the documents 
presented under such Letter of Credit with the terms thereof shall, in each 
case, be deemed not to constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct of 
such Issuing Bank.

3.8 Cash Collateral Account. At any time and from time to time (i) after 
the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, the 
Administrative Agent may, and at the direction or with the consent of the 
Required Lenders shall, require (A) Crawford to deliver to the 
Administrative Agent such additional amount of cash, in the appropriate 
Currency or Currencies, as is equal to 105% of the aggregate Stated Amount 
of all Letters of Credit outstanding (whether or not any beneficiary under 
any Letter of Credit shall have drawn or be entitled at such time to draw 
thereunder) and (B) the Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers to deliver to the 
Administrative Agent such additional amount of cash, in the appropriate 
Currency or Currencies, as is equal to 105% of the aggregate Stated Amount 
of all Letters of Credit outstanding that were issued for the account of a 
Foreign Subsidiary (whether or not any beneficiary under any such Letter of 
Credit shall have drawn or be entitled at such time to draw thereunder) and 
(ii) in the event of a prepayment under Section 2.6(b) or 2.6(c), the 
Administrative Agent will retain such amount as may then be required to be 
retained, such amounts in each case under clauses (i) and (ii) above to be 
held by the Administrative Agent in one or more cash collateral accounts 
(the Cash Collateral Accounts). Each Borrower hereby grants to the 
Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Issuing Banks and the Lenders, 
a Lien upon and security interest in the Cash Collateral Accounts and all 
amounts held therein from time to time as security for such Borrowers L/C 
Obligations, and for application to such Borrowers Reimbursement 
Obligations as and when the same shall arise; provided that any Cash 
Collateral provided pursuant to this Section 3.8 by the Foreign Subsidiary 
Borrowers shall (x) be maintained in a separate and distinct Cash 
Collateral Account from the Cash Collateral Account in which Cash 
Collateral provided by Crawford is maintained and (y) secure only L/C 
Obligations related to Letters of Credit issued for the account of a 
Foreign Subsidiary. The

Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including 
the exclusive right of withdrawal, over the Cash Collateral Accounts. Other 
than any interest on the investment of such amounts in Cash Equivalents, 
which investments shall be made at the direction of Crawford (unless a 
Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, in which 
case the determination as to investments shall be made at the option and in 
the discretion of the Administrative Agent), amounts in the Cash Collateral 
Accounts shall not bear interest. Interest and profits, if any, on such 
investments shall accumulate in such accounts. In the event of a drawing, 
and subsequent payment by any Issuing Bank, under any Letter of Credit at 
any time during which any amounts are held in any Cash Collateral Account, 
the Administrative Agent will deliver to such Issuing Bank an amount from 
the appropriate Cash Collateral Account equal to the Reimbursement 
Obligation created as a result of such payment (or, if the amounts so held 
are less than such Reimbursement Obligation, all of such amounts) to 
reimburse such Issuing Bank therefor; provided that if the amounts so 
delivered by the Administrative Agent are denominated in a Currency 
different than that in which the corresponding Reimbursement Obligation is 
denominated, the Administrative Agent shall determine the amount to deliver 
by reference to the Spot Rate with respect to such Currencies at such time, 
and such determination shall be correct absent manifest error. Any amounts 
remaining in the Cash Collateral Account (including interest) after the 
expiration of all Letters of Credit and reimbursement in full of each 
Issuing Bank for all of its obligations thereunder shall be held by the 
Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Borrowers, to be applied 
against the Obligations in such order and manner as the Administrative 
Agent may direct; provided that no Cash Collateral (or applicable interest) 
provided by a Foreign Subsidiary Borrower may be applied to any U.S. 
Obligation. If any Borrower is required to provide Cash Collateral pursuant 
to Section 2.6(b), such amount (including interest), to the extent not 
applied as aforesaid, shall be returned to such Borrower on demand; 
provided that after giving effect to such return (i) the Aggregate Credit 
Exposure would not exceed the aggregate Commitments at such time and (ii) 
no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at 
such time. If any Borrower is required to provide Cash Collateral as a 
result of an Event of Default, such amount (to the extent not applied as 
aforesaid) shall be returned to such Borrower within three Business Days 
after all Events of Default have been cured or waived.

3.9 The Issuing Banks. Each Issuing Bank shall act on behalf of the Lenders 
with respect to any Letters of Credit issued by it and the documents 
associated therewith, and each Issuing Bank shall have all of the rights, 
benefits and immunities (i) provided to the Administrative Agent in 
Article X with respect to any acts taken or omissions suffered by it in 
connection with Letters of Credit issued by it or proposed to be issued by 
it and any documents pertaining to such Letters of Credit as fully as if 
the term Administrative Agent as used in Article X included the Issuing 
Banks with respect to such acts or omissions and (ii) as additionally 
provided herein with respect to the Issuing Banks.

3.10 Effectiveness. Notwithstanding any termination of the Commitments or 
repayment of the Loans, or both, the obligations of the Borrowers under 
this Article III shall remain in full force and effect until the Issuing 
Banks and Lenders shall have no further obligations to make any payments or 
disbursements under any circumstances with respect to any Letter of Credit.
 
88

------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.11 Reporting of Letter of Credit Information. At any time that there is 
an Issuing Bank that is not also the financial institution acting as 
Administrative Agent, then (i) on the date that is five Business Days prior 
to the end of each fiscal quarter and (ii) upon the request of the 
Administrative Agent, each such Issuing Bank (or, in the case of clause 
(ii) of this Section 3.11, the applicable Issuing Bank) shall deliver to 
the Administrative Agent a report setting forth in form and detail 
reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent information (including 
any reimbursement, Cash Collateral or termination in respect of Letters of 
Credit issued by such Issuing Bank) with respect to each Letter of Credit 
issued by such Issuing Bank that is outstanding hereunder. No failure on 
the part of any Issuing Bank to provide such information pursuant to this 
Section 3.11 shall limit the obligations of the Borrowers or any Lender 
hereunder with respect to its reimbursement and participation obligations 
hereunder.


3.12 Cash Collateral for Extended Letters of Credit.

(a) Cash Collateralization. Each applicable Borrower shall provide Cash 
Collateral to each applicable Issuing Bank with respect to each Letter of 
Credit with an expiry date after the L/C Maturity Date (each such Letter of 
Credit, an Extended Letter of Credit) issued by such Issuing Bank (in an 
amount equal to 105% of the Stated Amount of each Extended Letter of 
Credit) on or before the L/C Maturity Date by depositing such amount in 
immediately available funds, in the appropriate Currency or Currencies, 
into a cash collateral account maintained at the applicable Issuing Bank 
and shall enter into a cash collateral agreement in form and substance 
reasonably satisfactory to such Issuing Bank and such other documentation 
as such Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent may reasonably request; 
provided that if any Borrower fails to provide Cash Collateral with respect 
to any Extended Letter of Credit by such time, such event shall be treated 
as a drawing under such Extended Letter of Credit in an amount equal to 
105% of the Stated Amount of such Letter of Credit, which shall be 
reimbursed (or participations therein funded) in accordance with this 
Article III with the proceeds of Revolving Loans (or funded participations) 
being utilized to provide Cash Collateral for such Extended Letter of 
Credit (provided that, for purposes of determining the Unutilized 
Commitments, the portion of any Extended Letter of Credit that has been (or 
will concurrently be) Cash Collateralized with proceeds of Revolving Loans 
will not be deemed to be a utilization of the Commitments).

(b) Grant of Security Interest. Each of the Borrowers and, to the extent 
provided by any Lender, such Lenders hereby grants to the applicable 
Issuing Bank of each Extended Letter of Credit, and agrees to maintain, a 
first-priority security interest in, all Cash Collateral required to be 
provided by this Section 3.12 as security for such Issuing Banks 
obligation to fund draws under such Extended Letter of Credit, to be 
applied pursuant to Section 3.12(c). If at any time the applicable Issuing 
Bank determines that the Cash Collateral is subject to any right or claim 
of any Person other than such Issuing Bank as herein provided, or that the 
total amount of such Cash Collateral is less than the amount required 
pursuant to Section 3.12(a), then the applicable Borrower will, promptly 
upon demand by such Issuing Bank, pay or provide to such Issuing Bank 
additional Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to eliminate such 
deficiency.

(c) Application. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this 
Agreement or any other Credit Document, Cash Collateral provided under this 
Section 3.12 in respect of any Extended Letter of Credit shall be applied 
to reimburse the applicable Issuing Bank for all drawings made under such 
Extended Letter of Credit and any and all fees, expenses and charges 
incurred in connection therewith, prior to any other application of such 
property as may otherwise be provided for herein.
 
89

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(d) Cash Collateralized Letters of Credit. Subject to Section 3.12(e), if 
any Borrower has fully Cash Collateralized the applicable Issuing Bank with 
respect to any Extended Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank in 
accordance with Sections 3.12(a) through 3.12(c) and such Borrower and the 
applicable Issuing Bank have made arrangements between them with respect to 
the pricing and fees associated therewith (each such Extended Letter of 
Credit, a Cash Collateralized Letter of Credit), then, after the date of 
notice to the Administrative Agent thereof by the applicable Issuing Bank 
and for so long as such Cash Collateral remains in place, (i) such Cash 
Collateralized Letter of Credit shall cease to be a Letter of Credit 
hereunder, (ii) such Cash Collateralized Letter of Credit shall not 
constitute a utilization of the Commitments hereunder, (iii) no Lender 
shall have any further obligation to fund participations or Revolving Loans 
to reimburse any drawing under such Cash Collateralized Letter of Credit, 
(iv) no letter of credit fees under Section 2.9(b)(i) shall be due or 
payable to the Lenders, or any of them, hereunder with respect to such Cash 
Collateralized Letter of Credit and (v) any fronting fee, issuance fee or 
other fee with respect to such Cash Collateralized Letter of Credit shall 
be as agreed separately between the applicable Borrower and such Issuing 
Bank.

(e) Reinstatement. Each of the Borrowers and the Lenders agree that, if any 
payment or deposit made by any Borrower or any other Person applied to the 
Cash Collateral required under this Section 3.12 is at any time avoided, 
annulled, set aside, rescinded, invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or 
preferential or otherwise required to be refunded or repaid, or is repaid 
in whole or in part pursuant to a good faith settlement of a pending or 
threatened avoidance claim, or the proceeds of any such Cash Collateral are 
required to be refunded by the applicable Issuing Bank to any Borrower or 
any Lender or its respective estate, trustee, receiver or any other Person, 
under any applicable law or equitable cause, then, on and after the date 
thereof until such time as the applicable Extended Letter of Credit is Cash 
Collateralized as provided under this Section 3.12, to the extent of such 
payment or repayment, (i) the applicable Extended Letter of Credit, if such 
Extended Letter of Credit had been a Cash Collateralized Letter of Credit 
immediately prior thereto, shall automatically be a Letter of Credit 
hereunder in a face amount equal to such payment or repayment (each such 
Letter of Credit, a Reinstated Letter of Credit), (ii) such Reinstated 
Letter of Credit shall no longer be deemed to be Cash Collateralized 
hereunder and shall constitute a utilization of the Commitments, (iii) each 
Lender shall be obligated to fund participations or Revolving Loans to 
reimburse any drawing under such Reinstated Letter of Credit, (iv) letter 
of credit fees under Section 2.9(b)(i) shall accrue and be due and payable 
to the Lenders with respect to such Reinstated Letter of Credit and (v) 
such Borrowers and each Lenders liability hereunder (and any Guaranty, 
Lien or Cash Collateral guaranteeing or securing such liability) shall be 
and remain in full force and effect, as fully as if such payment or deposit 
had never been made, and, if prior thereto, this Agreement shall have been 
canceled, terminated, paid in full or otherwise extinguished (and if any 
Guaranty, Lien or Cash Collateral guaranteeing or securing such Borrowers 
or such Lenders) liability hereunder shall have been released or 
terminated by virtue of such cancellation, termination, payment or 
extinguishment), the provisions of this Article III and all other rights 
and duties of the applicable Issuing Bank, the Lenders and the Credit 
Parties with respect to such Reinstated Letter of Credit (and any Guaranty, 
Lien or Cash Collateral guaranteeing or securing such liability) shall be 
reinstated in full force and effect, and such prior cancellation, 
termination,
 
90

------------------------------------------------------------------------
payment or extinguishment shall not diminish, release, discharge, impair or 
otherwise affect the obligations of such Persons in respect of such 
Reinstated Letter of Credit (and any Guaranty, Lien or Cash Collateral 
guaranteeing or securing such obligation).

(f) Survival. With respect to any Extended Letter of Credit, each partys 
obligations under this Article III and all other rights and duties of the 
applicable Issuing Bank of such Extended Letter of Credit, the Lenders and 
the Credit Parties with respect to such Extended Letter of Credit shall 
survive the resignation or replacement of the applicable Issuing Bank or 
any assignment of rights by the applicable Issuing Bank, the termination of 
the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of the 
Obligations.

3.13 Conflict with Issuer Documents. In the event of any conflict between 
the terms here and the terms of any Issuer Document, the terms hereof shall 
control.

or other applicable formation or organizational documents, (ii) contravene 
any other Requirement of Law applicable to it, (iii) conflict with, result

bound or to which it is subject, or (iv) except for the Liens granted in 
favor of the Administrative Agent pursuant to the Security Documents, 
result in or require the creation or imposition of any Lien upon any of its 
properties, revenues or assets other than Permitted Liens; except, in the 
case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above, where such violations, conflicts, 
breaches or defaults, individually or in the aggregate, could not 
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

5.4 Governmental and Third-Party Authorization; Permits. No consent, 
approval, authorization or other action by, notice to, or registration or 
filing with, any Governmental Authority or other Person is or will be 
required as a condition to or otherwise in connection with the due

replacement authority (or any other regulator to which the relevant entity 
becomes subject)) pursuant to Part XII of the UK Financial Services and 
Markets Act 2000 (headed Control over Authorised Persons) and (v) 
consents and filings the failure to obtain or make which, individually or 
in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a Material 
Adverse Effect. Each Consolidated Entity has all governmental approvals, 
licenses, permits and authorizations necessary to conduct its business as 
presently conducted and to own or lease and operate its properties, except 
for those the failure to obtain which, individually or in the aggregate, 
could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

5.5 Litigation. There are no actions, investigations, suits or proceedings 
pending or, to the knowledge of any Borrower, threatened, at law, in equity 
or in arbitration, before any court, other Governmental Authority, 
arbitrator or other Person, (i) against or affecting any of the 
Consolidated Entities or any of their respective properties that could 
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or (ii) on the 
Closing Date, with respect to this Agreement, any of the other Credit 
Documents or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

5.6 Taxes. Each Consolidated Entity has timely filed all federal, national, 
state, provincial, local and foreign income tax returns and all other 
federal, national, state, provincial, local and foreign tax returns and 
reports required to be filed by it except (a) in the case of tax returns or 
reports that may be required to be filed in jurisdictions other than the 
United States or political subdivisions thereof, those foreign tax returns 
or reports that, in the aggregate, would not reflect an amount of taxes 
owing that would be material or (b) where the failure to timely file or 
cause to be timely filed such returns or reports would not reasonably be 
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. Such returns accurately 
reflect in all material respects all liability for taxes of the 
Consolidated Entities for the periods covered thereby. Each Consolidated 
Entity has paid all taxes and other amounts shown to be due and payable on 
such returns or reports or on any assessments made against it or its 
property and all other taxes, fees or other charges imposed on it or any of 
its property by any Governmental Authority, except (x) where the same are 
currently being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and for 
which such Consolidated Entity has set aside on its books adequate reserves 
or (y) to the extent the failure to pay such tax, amount, assessment, fee 
or other charge could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material 
Adverse Effect. As of the Closing Date, there is no ongoing audit or 
examination or, to the knowledge of such Borrower, other investigation by 
any Governmental Authority of the tax liability of any Consolidated Entity, 
and there is no material unresolved claim by any Governmental Authority 
concerning the tax liability of any Consolidated Entity for any period for 
which tax returns have been or were required to have been filed, other than 
(i) claims that are currently being contested in good faith by appropriate 
proceedings and for which such

Consolidated Entity has set aside on its books adequate reserves or (ii) 
audits, investigations and claims that, individually or in the aggregate,

requested to waive or extend the statute of limitations relating to the 
payment of any taxes.

as to each U.S. Subsidiary and Foreign Subsidiary Borrower, (x) the number 
of shares, units or other interests of each class of Capital Stock 
outstanding, and the number and effect, if exercised, of all outstanding 
options, warrants, rights of conversion or purchase and similar rights and 
(y) the direct holders of all such Capital Stock and the number of shares, 
units, interests, options, warrants or other purchase rights held by each,

or hereafter furnished in writing to the Administrative Agent, any Security 
Trustee, any Arranger, any Issuing Bank or any Lender by or on behalf of 
any Consolidated Entity for purposes of or in connection with this 
Agreement or the other Credit Documents is or will be true and accurate in 
all material respects on the date as of which such information is dated or 
certified (or, if such information has been updated, amended or 
supplemented, on the date as of which any such update, amendment or 
supplement is dated or certified) and not made incomplete by omitting to 
state a material fact necessary to make the statements contained herein and 
therein, in light of the circumstances under which such information was 
provided, not misleading in any material respect; provided that, with 
respect to projections, budgets and other estimates, except as specifically 
represented in Section 5.11(b), each Borrower represents only that such 
information was prepared in good faith based upon assumptions believed to 
be reasonable at the time. As of the Closing Date, there is no fact known 
to any Consolidated Entity that has, or could reasonably be expected to 
have, a Material Adverse Effect, which fact has not been set forth herein, 
in the financial statements of Crawford and its Subsidiaries furnished to 
the Administrative Agent and/or the Lenders, or in any certificate, opinion 
or other written statement made or furnished by any Borrower to the 
Administrative Agent and/or the Lenders.

5.9 Margin Regulations. No Consolidated Entity is engaged principally, or 
as one of its important activities, in the business of extending credit for 
the purpose of purchasing or carrying Margin Stock. No proceeds of the 
Loans will be used, directly or indirectly, to purchase or carry any Margin 
Stock, to extend credit for such purpose or for any other purpose, in each 
case that would violate or be inconsistent with Regulations T, U or X or 
any provision of the Exchange Act.

5.11 Financial Matters.

(a) Crawford has heretofore furnished to the Administrative Agent copies of 
(i) the audited consolidated balance sheets of Crawford and its 
Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, in each case with the 
related statements of income, cash flows and stockholders equity for the 
fiscal years then ended, together with the opinion of Ernst & Young LLP 
thereon, and (ii) the unaudited consolidated balance sheet of Crawford and 
its Subsidiaries as of June 30, 2017, and the related statements of income, 
cash flows and stockholders equity for the six-month period then ended. 
Such financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP 
(subject, with respect to the unaudited financial statements, to the 
absence of notes required by GAAP and to normal year-end adjustments) and 
present fairly in all material respects the financial condition of Crawford 
and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis as of the respective dates 
thereof and the results of operations of Crawford and its Subsidiaries on a 
consolidated basis for the respective periods then ended.

(b) Crawford has prepared, and has heretofore furnished to the 
Administrative Agent a copy of, projected consolidated balance sheets and 
statements of income and cash flows of the Consolidated Entities 
(consisting of balance sheets and statements of income and cash flows 
prepared by Crawford) through the end of fiscal year 2022, giving effect to 
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (the Projections
). The Projections have been prepared in good faith based upon assumptions 
believed by the management of each Borrower to be reasonable when made (it 
being understood that (i) such Projections are as to future events and are 
not to be viewed as facts or a guarantee of performance and are subject to 
significant uncertainties and contingencies many of which are beyond the 
Borrowers control and (ii) no assurance can be given that any particular 
Projections will be realized, and that actual results during the period or 
periods covered by any such Projections may differ significantly from the 
projected results, and such differences may be material).

(c) After giving effect to the consummation of the transactions 
contemplated hereby on the Closing Date, the Consolidated Entities, taken 
as a whole, are Solvent.

5.12 Ownership of Properties. Each Consolidated Entity that is not an 
Immaterial Subsidiary (i) has good and marketable title to all real 
property owned by it, (ii) holds interests as lessee under valid leases in 
full force and effect with respect to all material leased real and personal 
property necessary in connection with its business, and (iii) has good 
title to all of its other material properties and assets reflected in the 
most recent financial statements referred to in Section 5.11(a) that are 
necessary in connection with its business (except as sold or otherwise 
disposed of since the date thereof in the ordinary course of business), in 
each case free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens.
 
99

------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.13 ERISA; Non-U.S. Pension Plans.

(a) Each Consolidated Entity and its ERISA Affiliates is in compliance with 
the applicable provisions of ERISA, and each Plan is and has been 
administered in compliance with all applicable Requirements of Law, 
including the applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code, in each case 
except where the failure so to comply, individually or in the aggregate, 
could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. No 
ERISA Event that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse 
Effect (i) has occurred within the five-year period prior to the Closing 
Date, (ii) has occurred and is continuing, or (iii) to the knowledge of any 
Borrower, is reasonably expected to occur with respect to any Plan. Except 
as could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, no 
Plan has any Unfunded Pension Liability as of the most recent annual 
valuation date applicable thereto, and no Consolidated Entity or any of its 
ERISA Affiliates has engaged in a transaction that could be subject to 
Section 4069 or 4212(c) of ERISA.

(b) No Consolidated Entity or any of its ERISA Affiliates has any 
outstanding liability on account of a complete or partial withdrawal from 
any Multiemployer Plan, and no Consolidated Entity or any of its ERISA 
Affiliates would become subject to any liability under ERISA if any such 
Consolidated Entity or ERISA Affiliate were to withdraw completely from all 
Multiemployer Plans as of the most recent valuation date. No Multiemployer 
Plan is in reorganization or is insolvent within the meaning of such 
terms under ERISA.

(c) Each Non-U.S. Pension Plan is in compliance with all requirements of 
law applicable thereto and the respective requirements of the governing 
documents for such plan except to the extent such non-compliance would not 
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. With respect 
to each Non-U.S. Pension Plan, neither Crawford nor any of its Related 
Parties has engaged in a transaction, or other act or omission (including 
entering into this Agreement and any act done or to be done in connection 
with this Agreement), that has subjected, or could reasonably be expected 
to subject, any Consolidated Entity, directly or indirectly, to any penalty 
(including any tax or civil penalty), fine, claim or other liability 
(including any liability under a contribution notice issued by the UK 
Pensions Regulator under Section 38 or Section 47 of the United Kingdom 
Pensions Act 2004 (UK Contribution Notice) or a financial support 
direction issued by the UK Pensions Regulator under Section 43 of the 
United Kingdom Pensions Act 2004 (UK Financial Support Direction), or any 
liability or amount payable under section 75 or 75A of the United Kingdom 
Pensions Act 1995), that could reasonably be expected, individually or in 
the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect, and there are no facts or 
circumstances which are reasonably likely to give rise to any such penalty, 
fine, claim, or other liability. With respect to each Non-U.S. Pension 
Plan, reserves have been established in the financial statements furnished 
to Lenders in respect of any unfunded liabilities in accordance with 
applicable law or, where required, in accordance with ordinary accounting 
practices in the jurisdiction in which such Non-U.S. Pension Plan is 
maintained. There are no actions, suits or claims (other than routine 
claims for benefits) pending against or, to the knowledge of any Borrower, 
threatened against any Consolidated Entity with respect to any Non-U.S. 
Pension Plan that could reasonably be expected, individually or in the 
aggregate, to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(d) All employer and employee payments, contributions and premiums required 
to be remitted, paid to or in respect of each Canadian Pension Plan have 
been paid or remitted in accordance with its terms and all applicable laws.

(e) The Canada Pension Entities do not, and have not ever, sponsored, 
administered or participated in a retirement or pension arrangement that 
contains a defined benefit provision (as that term is defined in the Income 
Tax Act (Canada)) to employees or former employees of any Canada Pension 
Entity.

(f) Each Borrower represents and warrants as of the Closing Date that such 
Borrower is not and will not be (i) an employee benefit plan subject to 
Title I of ERISA, (ii) a plan or account subject to Section 4975 of the 
Code, (iii) an entity deemed to hold plan assets of any such plans or 
accounts for purposes of ERISA or the Code or (iv) a governmental plan

Subsidiary is engaged in any unfair labor practice within the meaning of 
the National Labor Relations Act of 1947 that would reasonably be expected 
to result in a Material Adverse Effect. As of the Closing Date, there is 
(i) no unfair labor practice complaint before the National Labor Relations 
Board, or grievance or arbitration proceeding arising out of or under any 
collective bargaining agreement, pending or, to the knowledge of any 
Borrower, threatened, against any Consolidated Entity, (ii) no strike, 
lock-out, slowdown, stoppage, walkout or other labor dispute pending or, to 
the knowledge of any Borrower, threatened, against any Consolidated Entity,

to any Consolidated Entity. As of the Closing Date, there are no collective 
bargaining agreements covering the employees of the Consolidated Entities.

released, treated, transported, disposed of or stored, currently or in the 
past, (i) by any Consolidated Entity or (ii) to the knowledge of any 
Borrower, by any other Person (including any predecessor in interest) or 
otherwise, in either case in, on, about or to or from any portion of any 
real property, leased, owned or operated by any Consolidated Entity, except

such real property or, to the knowledge of any Borrower, any other real 
property at any time leased, owned or operated by any Consolidated Entity 
is contaminated by any Hazardous Substance; and no portion of any real 
property leased, owned or operated by any Consolidated Entity is presently

Consolidated Entity has been used by any Consolidated Entity or, to the 
knowledge of any Borrower, by any other Person, as or for a mine, landfill, 
dump or other disposal facility, gasoline service station or bulk petroleum 
products storage facility; and no portion of such real property or any 
other real property currently or at any time in the past leased, owned or 
operated by any Consolidated

compliance with the requirements of all applicable Environmental Laws; each

Environmental Laws necessary to its respective operations, all such

and no Consolidated Entity is involved in any suit, action or proceeding, 
or has received any notice, complaint or other request for information from 
any Governmental Authority or other Person, with respect to any actual or 
alleged Environmental Claims, and to the knowledge of any Borrower, there 
are no threatened Environmental Claims, nor any basis therefor.

5.16 Compliance with Laws. Each Consolidated Entity has timely filed all 
material reports, documents and other materials required to be filed by it 
under all applicable Requirements of Law with any Governmental Authority, 
has retained all material records and documents required to be retained by 
it under all applicable Requirements of Law, and is otherwise in compliance 
with all applicable Requirements of Law in respect of the conduct of its 
business and the ownership and operation of its properties, except in each 
case to the extent that the failure to comply therewith, individually or in 
the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse 
Effect.

5.17 Intellectual Property. Except as, individually or in the aggregate, 
could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, each 
Consolidated Entity owns, or has the legal right to use, all Intellectual 
Property necessary for it to conduct its business as currently conducted. 
Schedule 5.17 lists, as of the Closing Date and after giving effect to the 
transactions contemplated hereby, all registered Intellectual Property 
owned by any U.S. Credit Party. No claim has been asserted or is pending by 
any Person challenging or questioning the use of any such Intellectual 
Property or the validity or effectiveness of any such Intellectual 
Property, nor does any Borrower know of any such claim, and to the 
knowledge of each Borrower, the use of such Intellectual Property by any 
Consolidated Entity does not infringe on the known rights of any Person, 
except for such claims and infringements that, individually or in the 
aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse 
Effect.

(other than Immaterial Subsidiaries) to, (i) maintain with financially 
sound and reputable insurance companies insurance with respect to its

Administrative Agent, deliver certificates of such insurance with respect 
to U.S. Credit Parties to the Administrative Agent with standard loss

tenants and subtenants obtain and comply in all material respects with and

that the failure to do so could not reasonably be expected to have a 
Material Adverse Effect, and (ii) conduct and complete all investigations, 
studies, sampling and testing, and all remedial, removal and other actions, 
required under Environmental Laws and promptly comply in all material 
respects with all lawful orders and directives of all Governmental 
Authorities regarding Environmental Laws, except to the extent that the

compliance with the requirements of any Governmental Authority having 
jurisdiction over it, and (ii) permit employees or agents of the 
Administrative Agent or any Lender to visit and inspect its properties and

copies and memoranda of them, and to discuss its affairs, finances and 
accounts with its officers and employees and, upon notice to the applicable 
Borrower, the independent public accountants of Crawford or such Borrower 
and their respective Subsidiaries (and by this provision each Borrower 
authorizes such accountants to discuss the finances and affairs of Crawford 
and such Borrower and their respective Subsidiaries; provided that an 
Authorized Officer of Crawford or such Borrower or Subsidiary shall have 
the right to participate in any such discussion and Crawford shall be given 
reasonable prior written notice (by electronic mail or otherwise) of any 
such discussion), all at such times and from time to time, upon reasonable 
notice and during business hours, as may be reasonably requested; provided
, however, that so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, the 
Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall make no more than one such 
inspection during any fiscal year of Crawford.

6.9 Material U.S. Subsidiaries. Crawford will take such action, and will 
cause each of its Subsidiaries to take such action, from time to time as 
shall be necessary to ensure that each Material U.S. Subsidiary is a 
Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder; provided that no Material U.S. Subsidiary 
that is a Disregarded Foreign Subsidiary shall be required to become a 
Subsidiary Guarantor or become party to any other Credit Document unless 
each parent company of such Disregarded Foreign Subsidiary that is also a 
Foreign Subsidiary is required to become a Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder. 
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that 
Crawford or one of its Subsidiaries from time to time creates or acquires 
new Material U.S.
 
110

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subsidiaries, or the financial statements delivered by Crawford pursuant to 
Section 6.1 demonstrate that a Subsidiary has become a Material U.S.

this Agreement and the other Credit Documents, and (B) a joinder to the 
Security Agreement, pursuant to which such new Material U.S. Subsidiary

inventory, equipment, general intangibles and other personal property as 
Collateral for its obligations under the Guaranty, subject only to 
Permitted Liens, and (ii) Crawford will, or will cause its Subsidiary that 
directly owns the Capital Stock of such new Material U.S. Subsidiary to, 
execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an amendment or supplement 
to the Security Agreement pursuant to which all of the Capital Stock of 
such new Material U.S. Subsidiary (or, with respect to a Material U.S. 
Subsidiary that is a Disregarded Foreign Subsidiary, only 65% of its 
Capital Stock) shall be pledged to the Administrative Agent, together with 
the certificates evidencing such Capital Stock and undated stock powers 
duly executed in blank (to the extent delivery thereof does not require any 
action in any non-U.S. jurisdiction or require the replacement and 
reissuance of such certificates with one or more certificates);


(b) Crawford will deliver to the Administrative Agent:

(i) if reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent, a written legal 
opinion of counsel to such Material U.S. Subsidiary addressed to the 
Administrative Agent and the Lenders, in form and substance reasonably 
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and its counsel, which shall cover

certificate of formation or other organizational document and all 
amendments thereto of such Material U.S. Subsidiary, certified as of a 
recent date by the Secretary of State (or comparable Governmental 
Authority) of its jurisdiction of organization (if available), and that the 
same has not been amended since the date of such certification, (ii) that 
attached thereto is a true and complete copy of the bylaws, constitutional 
documents, operating agreement or similar governing document of such 
Material U.S. Subsidiary, as then in effect and as in effect at all times 
from the date on which the resolutions referred to in clause (iii) below 
were adopted to and including the date of such certificate, and (iii) that 
attached thereto is a true and complete copy of resolutions adopted by the 
board of directors (or similar governing body) of such
 
111

Material U.S. Subsidiary, authorizing the execution, delivery and 
performance of the documents executed pursuant to Section 6.9(a), and (iv)

director of such Material U.S. Subsidiary executing any of the documents 
executed pursuant to Section 6.9(a), and attaching all such copies of the 
documents described above.

(c) As promptly as reasonably possible, Crawford will, and will cause its 
Subsidiaries to, deliver any such other documents, certificates and 
opinions, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the 
Administrative Agent, as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request in 
connection therewith and will take such other action as the Administrative 
Agent may reasonably request to create in favor of the Administrative 
Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders, a perfected security interest in the 
Collateral being pledged pursuant to the documents described above.

(d) With respect to the U.S. Subsidiaries and Disregarded Foreign 
Subsidiaries that are not Credit Parties, if any (each such Person, other 
than any Subsidiary of any Non-Disregarded Foreign Subsidiary, a 
Specified Person), if, as of the end of any fiscal quarter for which 
financial statements have been delivered pursuant to Section 6.1, it is 
determined that (i)(A) the consolidated revenue or Consolidated EBITDA of 
such Specified Persons, in the aggregate, for the Reference Period ending 
on such date exceeds 15% of the consolidated revenues or Consolidated 
EBITDA, as applicable, of Crawford, the U.S. Subsidiaries and the 
Disregarded Foreign Subsidiaries (without regard to any other Foreign 
Subsidiary), or (B) the total assets of such Specified Persons, in the 
aggregate, as of such date exceeds 15% of the total assets of Crawford, the

the foregoing, any Subsidiary of Crawford owns, directly or indirectly, 50% 
or more of the Capital Stock of such Specified Persons, then, in either 
case, the Borrowers shall, and shall cause their Subsidiaries to, cause 
such number of such Specified Persons and the applicable Persons described 
in clause (ii) to become Credit Parties in accordance with this Section 6.9 
as is necessary to cause the matters described in clause (i) to cease to be 
true after giving pro forma effect to any such Specified Persons becoming 
a Credit Party.

Administrative Agent in connection with the publication of certain

restrictive or add any new covenant or event of default unless the 
Administrative Agent shall have determined in its
 
126

------------------------------------------------------------------------
reasonable discretion that such covenants and events of default are no more 
restrictive than those contained herein (and, if so determined, the 
Administrative Agent shall provide written notice to the Borrowers 
acknowledging such determination), or (iii) to grant any security or

(including the Swingline Lender), and (y) such Defaulting Lender shall 
provide promptly to the Administrative Agent a statement describing in 
reasonable detail the obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender as to 
which it exercised such right of setoff. The rights of each Lender, each 
Issuing Bank and their respective Affiliates under this Section 9.3 are in 
addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff)

Administrative Agent promptly after any such setoff and application; 
provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity 
of such setoff and application.

Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other 
implied (or express) obligations under agency doctrine of any applicable 
law. Instead, such term is used as a matter of market custom, and is 
intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between 
contracting parties.

(b) The Administrative Agent shall also act as the collateral agent under 
the Credit Documents, and each of the Lenders (including in its capacity as 
a potential Hedge Party or Cash Management Bank) and the Issuing Banks 
hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent to act 
as the agent of such Lender and such Issuing Bank for purposes of 
acquiring, holding and enforcing any and all Liens on Collateral granted by 
any of the Credit Parties to secure any of the Obligations, together with 
such powers and discretion as are reasonably incidental thereto (including 
to enter into additional Credit Documents or supplements to existing Credit 
Documents on their behalf). In this connection, the Administrative Agent, 
as collateral agent and any co-agents, sub-agents and attorneys-in-fact 
appointed by the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Article X for 
purposes of holding or enforcing any Lien on the Collateral (or any portion 
thereof) granted under the Security Documents, or for exercising any rights 
and remedies thereunder at the direction of the Administrative Agent), 
shall be entitled to the benefits of all provisions of Articles X and XI 
(including Section 11.1, as though such co-agents, sub-agents and 
attorneys-in-fact were the collateral agent under the Credit Documents) 
as if set forth in full herein with respect thereto.

10.2 Rights as a Lender. The Person serving as the Administrative Agent 
hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender 
as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the 
Administrative Agent, and the term Lender or Lenders shall, unless 
otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, 
include the Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder in its 
individual capacity. Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits 
from, lend money to, own securities of, act as the financial advisor or in 
any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of 
business with Crawford or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if 
such Person were not the Administrative Agent hereunder and without any 
duty to account therefor to the Lenders. If a single Person serves in 
multiple roles hereunder (including as the Administrative Agent, any
 
134

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Security Trustee, any Issuing Bank, the Swingline Lender or any Lender), 
then no formal instructions or other communication is required with respect 
to any communication between those roles notwithstanding any requirement 
hereunder for notice, written or otherwise.


10.3 Exculpatory Provisions.

(a) The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations 
except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Credit Documents, 
and its duties hereunder shall be administrative in nature. Without 
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent:

(i) shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, 
regardless of whether a Default or Event of Default has occurred and is 
continuing;

(ii) shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise 
any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly 
contemplated hereby or by the other Credit Documents that the 
Administrative Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the 
Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as 
shall be expressly provided for herein or in the other Credit Documents); 
provided that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any 
action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the 
Administrative Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Credit 
Document or applicable law, including, for the avoidance of doubt, any 
action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any Debtor 
Relief Law or that may effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of 
property of a Defaulting Lender in violation of any Debtor Relief Law; and

(iii) shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other 
Credit Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for 
the failure to disclose, any information relating to Crawford or any of its 
Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as the 
Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.

(b) The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or 
not taken by it (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required 
Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be 
necessary, or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith shall 
be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Sections 11.5 and 9.2
), or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct 
as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and 
nonappealable judgment. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to 
have knowledge of any Default or Event of Default unless and until notice 
describing such Default or Event of Default is given to the Administrative 
Agent in writing by any Borrower or a Lender.

(c) The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty 
to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation 
made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Credit Document, 
(ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered 
hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the 
performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other 
terms or
 
135

------------------------------------------------------------------------
conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default or 
Event of Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or 
genuineness of this Agreement, any other Credit Document or any other 
agreement, instrument or document or (v) the satisfaction of any condition 
set forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt 
of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.

(d) The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible or have any liability 
for, or have any duty to ascertain, inquire into, monitor or enforce, 
compliance with the provisions hereof relating to Disqualified Lenders. 
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent 
shall not (x) be obligated to ascertain, monitor or inquire as to whether 
any Lender or Participant or prospective Lender or Participant is a 
Disqualified Lender or (y) have any liability with respect to or arising 
out of any assignment or participation of Loans, or disclosure of 
confidential information, to any Disqualified Lender.

10.4 Reliance by Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be 
entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, 
any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document 
or other writing (including any electronic message, internet or intranet 
website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to 
have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person. The 
Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or 
by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and 
shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining 
compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan, or the 
issuance, extension, renewal or increase of a Letter of Credit, that by its 
terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender or Issuing Bank, 
the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to 
such Lender or Issuing Bank unless the Administrative Agent shall have 
received notice to the contrary from such Lender or Issuing Bank prior to 
the making of such Loan or the issuance, extension, renewal or increase of 
such Letter of Credit. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal 
counsel (who may be counsel for a Borrower), independent accountants and 
other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken 
or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, 
accountants or experts.

10.5 Delegation of Duties. The Administrative Agent may perform any and all 
of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any 
other Credit Document by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by 
the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent 
may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by 
or through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of 
this Article shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties 
of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to 
their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the 
credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as 
Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for 
the negligence or misconduct of any sub-agent except to the extent that a 
court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and nonappealable 
judgment that the Administrative Agent acted with gross negligence or 
willful misconduct in the selection of such sub-agent.
 
136

------------------------------------------------------------------------
10.6 Resignation of Administrative Agent.

(a) The Administrative Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation 
to the Lenders and Crawford. Upon receipt of any such notice of 
resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation 
with Crawford, to appoint a successor, which shall be a bank with an office 
in the United States, or an Affiliate of any such bank with an office in 
the United States; provided, however, that in no event shall such successor 
Administrative Agent be a Defaulting Lender or a Disqualified Lender. If no 
such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and 
shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring 
Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation (or such earlier day 
as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders) (the Resignation Effective 
Date), then the retiring Administrative Agent may (but shall not be 
obligated to), on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative 
Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above. Regardless of whether a 
successor has been appointed or has accepted such appointment, such 
resignation shall become effective in accordance with such note on the 
Resignation Effective Date.

(b) With effect from the Resignation Effective Date, (i) the retiring 
Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations 
hereunder and under the other Credit Documents (except that in the case of 
any collateral security held by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the 
Lenders under any of the Credit Documents, the retiring Administrative 
Agent shall continue to hold such collateral security until such time as a 
successor Administrative Agent is appointed) and (ii) except for any 
indemnity payments owed to the retiring Administrative Agent, all payments, 
communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the 
Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender directly, 
until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor 
Administrative Agent as provided for in Section 10.6(a). Upon the 
acceptance of a successors appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, 
such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, 
powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent (other 
than any rights to indemnity payments owed to the retiring Administrative 
Agent), and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all 
of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Credit 
Documents. The fees payable by the Borrowers to a successor Administrative 
Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless 
otherwise agreed between Crawford and such successor. After the retiring 
Administrative Agents resignation hereunder and under the other Credit 
Documents, the provisions of this Article X and Section 11.1 shall continue 
in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its 
sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions 
taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring 
Administrative Agent was acting as Administrative Agent.

10.7 Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent and Other Lenders. Each Lender 
acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the 
Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties 
and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, 
made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. 
Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without 
reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their 
Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it shall 
from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in 
taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other 
Credit Document or any related agreement or any document furnished 
hereunder or thereunder.
 
137

------------------------------------------------------------------------
10.8 No Other Duties, etc. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, 
none of the Bookrunners, Arrangers, Syndication Agent, Documentation Agent 
or other agents listed on the cover page hereof shall have any powers, 
duties or responsibilities under this Agreement or any of the other Credit 
Documents, except in its capacity, as applicable, as the Administrative 
Agent or a Lender hereunder.

10.9 Administrative Agent May File Proofs of Claim. In case of the pendency 
of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or any other judicial 
proceeding relative to any Credit Party, the Administrative Agent 
(irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan or Reimbursement 
Obligation shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by 
declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Administrative 
Agent shall have made any demand on any Borrower) shall be entitled and 
empowered (but not obligated) by intervention in such proceeding or 
otherwise (i) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the 
principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans, 
Reimbursement Obligations and all other Obligations that are owing and 
unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary advisable in 
order to have the claims of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent 
(including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, 
disbursements and advances of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent and 
their respective agents, sub-agents and counsel and all other amounts due 
the Lenders and the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.9 and 11.1) 
allowed in such judicial proceeding and (ii) to collect and receive any 
monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to 
distribute the same. Any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, 
liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial 
proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender to make such payments to the 
Administrative Agent and, in the event that the Administrative Agent shall 
consent to the making of such payments to the Lenders, to pay to the 
Administrative any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, 
disbursements and advances of the Administrative Agent and its agents, 
sub-agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Administrative Agent 
under Section 2.9 or 11.1.


10.10 Collateral and Guaranty Matters.

(a) The Administrative Agent is hereby authorized on behalf of the Lenders, 
without the necessity of any notice to or further consent from the Lenders, 
from time to time (but without any obligation) to take any action with 
respect to the Collateral and the Security Documents that may be deemed by 
the Administrative Agent in its discretion to be necessary or advisable to 
perfect and maintain perfected the Liens upon the Collateral granted 
pursuant to the Security Documents. The Administrative Agent shall not be 
responsible for or have a duty to ascertain or inquire into the title of 
any Person to any Collateral, any representation or warranty regarding the 
existence, value or collectability of the Collateral, the existence, 
priority or perfection of the Administrative Agents Lien thereon, or any 
certificate prepared by any Credit Party in connection therewith, nor shall 
the Administrative Agent be responsible or liable to the Lenders for any 
failure to monitor or maintain any portion of the Collateral.
 
138

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(b) The Lenders hereby authorize the Administrative Agent, at its option 
and in its discretion, (i) to release any Lien on any property granted to 
or held by the Administrative Agent under any Credit Document (A) upon (w) 
termination of the Commitments, (x) payment in full of all of the 
Obligations (other than contingent and indemnification obligations not then 
due and payable and other than Obligations described in the following 
clause (y), except as expressly set forth therein), (y) termination of, and 
settlement of all obligations of all Consolidated Entities under, all Hedge 
Agreements required or permitted by this Agreement to which any Hedge Party 
is a party and all Cash Management Agreements to which any Cash Management 
Bank is a party to the extent the terms of such Hedge Agreements and Cash 
Management Agreements expressly require the termination thereof or 
settlement of the obligations of any Consolidated Entity thereunder as a 
result of the termination of the Credit Agreement and (z) expiration or 
termination of all Letters of Credit (other than Letters of Credit as to 
which other arrangements (including the posting of cash collateral) 
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Banks shall have 
been made), (B) that is sold or otherwise disposed of or to be sold or 
otherwise disposed of as part of or in connection with any sale or other 
disposition permitted under the Credit Documents or with respect to which 
such Lien is not required to be maintained pursuant to the terms of the 
Credit Documents or (C) subject to Section 11.5, if approved, authorized or 
ratified in writing by the Required Lenders; (ii) to subordinate any Lien 
on any property granted to or held by the Administrative Agent under any 
Credit Document to the holder of any Lien on such property that is 
permitted by Section 8.3(g); and (iii) to release any Subsidiary Guarantor 
from its obligations under the Guaranty if such Person ceases to be a 
Subsidiary as a result of a transaction permitted under the Credit 
Documents. Upon request by the Administrative Agent at any time, the 
Lenders will confirm in writing the Administrative Agents authority to 
release or subordinate its interest in particular types or items of 
property, or to release any Subsidiary Guarantor from its obligations under 
the Guaranty, pursuant to this Section 10.10(b).

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Credit 
Document, in no event shall any Cash Collateral provided with respect to 
any Extended Letter of Credit be released without the prior written consent 
of the applicable Issuing Bank of such Extended Letter of Credit.

10.11 Mutatis Mutandis. The provisions of this Article X shall apply to 
each Issuing Bank, the Swingline Lender and each Security Trustee mutatis 
mutandis to the same extent as such provisions apply to the Administrative 
Agent; provided that Section 10.12 shall apply only to the UK Security 
Trustee and Section 10.13 shall apply only to the Australian Security 
Trustee.


10.12 UK Security Trustee.

(a) Each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereby irrevocably 
appoints the UK Security Trustee on the terms and conditions set out in 
this Article X and any Security Document governed by English law to act as 
its trustee under and in relation to any such Security Document and to hold 
the assets subject to the security thereby created as trustee for the 
Administrative Agent and the Lenders on the trusts and other terms 
contained in this Article X and any such Security Document.

(b) The UK Successor Trustee shall have, subject to the provisions of any 
Security Document governed by English law, (i) all the powers of an 
absolute owner of the security constituted by such Security Document and 
(ii) all the rights, remedies and powers granted to it and be subject to 
all the obligations and duties owed by it under such Security Document or 
any of the Credit Documents.
 
139

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(c) Nothing in this Article X shall require the UK Security Trustee to act 
as a trustee at common law or to hold any property on trust in any 
jurisdiction outside the United Kingdom that may not operate under 
principles of trust or where such trust would not be recognized or its 
effects would not be enforceable.


10.13 Australian Security Trustee.

(a) Each of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders, the Hedge Parties and 
the Cash Management Banks appoint the Australian Security Trustee to act as 
security trustee under and in connection with the Secured Credit Documents 
(as defined in the Australian Security Trust Deed) and this Agreement. The 
Australian Security Trustee accepts this appointment.

(b) Each of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders, the Hedge Parties and 
the Cash Management Banks hereby irrevocably authorizes the Australian 
Security Trustee to exercise such rights, remedies, powers and discretions 
as are specifically delegated to it by the terms of any Secured Credit 
Document, together with all such rights, remedies, powers and discretions 
as are reasonably incidental hereto, and agrees to be bound by such action 
properly taken or properly not taken by the Australian Security Trustee. 
Any reference in this Agreement to Liens or other security interests stated 
to be in favor of the Administrative Agent shall be construed so as to 
include a reference to Liens or other security interests granted in favor 
of the Australian Security Trustee under any Security Document governed by 
Australian law.

(c) A successor to the Australian Security Trustee as provided for in this 
Article X shall have, subject to the provisions of any Security Document 
governed by Australian law, (i) all the powers of an absolute owner of the 
security constituted by such Security Document and (ii) all the rights, 
remedies and powers granted to it and be subject to all the obligations and 
duties owed by it under any of the Secured Credit Documents.

(d) Each of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders, the Hedge Parties and 
the Cash Management Banks agree that at any time that the beneficiary of 
the Liens under any Security Document governed by Australian law shall be a 
Person other than the Australian Security Trustee, such other Person shall 
have the rights, remedies, benefits and powers granted to the 
Administrative Agent in this Agreement and/or in any Security Document 
governed by Australian law. Nothing in this Article X shall require the 
Australian Security Trustee to act as a trustee at common law or to hold 
any property on trust in any jurisdiction outside of Australia that may not 
operate under principles of trust or where such trust would not be 
recognized or its effects would not be enforceable.


(e) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement:

(i) the Australian Security Trustee need not act (whether or not on 
instructions from one or more of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders, the 
Hedge Parties and Cash Management Banks) if it is impossible to act due to 
any cause beyond its control (including war, riot, natural disaster, labour 
dispute, or law taking effect after the date of this Agreement). The 
Australian Security Trustee agrees to notify the Administrative Agent, the 
Lenders, the Hedge Parties and Cash Management Banks and each Credit Party 
promptly after it determines it is unable to act; and
 
140

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(ii) the Australian Security Trustee has no responsibility or liability for 
any loss or expense suffered or incurred by any party as a result of its 
not acting for so long as the impossibility under this Section 10.13(e) 
continues. However, the Australian Security Trustee agrees to make 
reasonable efforts to avoid or remove the causes of non-performance and 
agrees to continue performance under this Agreement promptly when the 
causes are removed.

10.14 Hedge Agreements and Cash Management Agreements. No Cash Management 
Bank or Hedge Party that obtains the benefits of Section 2.12(e) or 
2.12(f) or any Collateral by virtue of the provisions hereof or of any 
Security Document shall have any right to notice of any action or to 
consent to, direct or object to any action hereunder or under any other 
Credit Document or otherwise in respect of the Collateral (including the 
release or impairment of any Collateral) other than in its capacity as a 
Lender and, in such case, only to the extent expressly provided in the 
Credit Documents. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article X to 
the contrary, the Administrative Agent shall not be required to verify the 
payment of, or that other satisfactory arrangements have been made with 
respect to, Cash Management Agreements and Hedge Agreements unless the 
Administrative Agent has received written notice of such Cash Management 
Agreements and Hedge Agreements, together with such reasonable supporting 
documentation as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request, from the 
applicable Cash Management Bank or Hedge Party, as the case may be.

Section 11.1(b) shall not apply with respect to Taxes other than any Taxes 
that represent losses, claims, damages or related liabilities or expenses 
arising from any non-Tax claim.

(c) To the extent that any Borrower for any reason fails to indefeasibly 
pay any amount required under Section 11.1(a) or 11.1(b) to be paid by it 
to the Administrative Agent (or any sub-agent thereof), any Issuing Bank, 
the Swingline Lender or any Related Party of any of the foregoing, each 
Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent (or any such 
sub-agent), such Issuing Bank, the Swingline Lender or such Related Party, 
as the case may be, such Lenders proportion (based on the percentages as 
used in determining the Required Lenders as of the time that the applicable 
unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount 
(including any such unpaid amount in respect of a claim asserted by such 
Lender); provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, 
damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by 
or asserted against the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent), 
against any Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender in their respective 
capacities as such, or against any Related Party of any of the foregoing 
acting for the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent), an Issuing

Agent, each Issuing Bank, each Swingline Lender, each other Lender, 
Crawford, each other Credit Party and each Related Party of any of the 
foregoing persons shall not assert, and each hereby waives, any claim on 
any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive 
damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in 
connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement, any other Credit 
Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the 
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, any Loan or Letter of Credit, 
or the use of the proceeds thereof, provided that the foregoing shall not 
in any way limit the Credit Parties or Lenders respective obligations 
under Section 11.1(b) or 11.1(c). No Indemnitee referred to in Section 
11.1(b) shall be liable for any damages arising from the use by unintended 
recipients of any information or other materials distributed by it through 
telecommunications, electronic or other information transmission systems 
(including the Platform, Intralinks, SyndTrak or similar systems) in 
connection with this Agreement or the other Credit Documents or the 
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

(e) All amounts due under this Section 11.1 shall be payable by Crawford or 
the applicable Borrower upon demand therefor.

(f) The provisions of this Section 11.1 shall apply to each Security 
Trustee mutatis mutandis to the same extent as such provisions apply to the 
Administrative Agent.

Process.

(a) This Agreement and the other Credit Documents and any claims, 
controversy, dispute or cause of action (whether in contract or tort or 
otherwise) based upon, arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any 
other Credit Document (except, as to any other Credit
 
143

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Document, except as expressly set forth therein) shall be governed by, and 
construed in accordance with, the law of the State of New York (including 
Sections 5-1401 and 5-1402 of the New York General Obligations Law, but 
excluding all other choice of law and conflicts of law rules); provided 
that (i) each standby Letter of Credit shall be governed by, and construed 
in accordance with, the laws or rules designated in such Letter of Credit 
or application therefor or, if no such laws or rules are designated, the 
International Standby Practices of the International Chamber of Commerce, 
as in effect from time to time (the ISP), and, as to matters not governed 
by the ISP, the laws of the State of New York (including Sections 5-1401 
and 5-1402 of the New York General Obligations Law, but excluding all other 
choice of law and conflicts of law rules) and (ii) the rules of the Uniform 
Customs and Practice for Documentary Credit, as most recently published by 
the International Chamber of Commerce at the time of issuance shall apply 
to each commercial Letter of Credit.

(b) Each Borrower irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that it will not 
commence any action, litigation or proceeding of any kind or description, 
whether in law or equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, 
against the Administrative Agent, any Lender, any Issuing Bank or any 
Related Party of any of the foregoing in any way relating to this Agreement 
or any other Credit Document or the transactions relating hereto or 
thereto, in any forum other than the courts of the State of New York 
sitting in New York County, and of the United States District Court of the 
Southern District of New York, and any appellate court from any thereof, 
and each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally submits to 
the jurisdiction of such courts and agrees that all claims in respect of 
any such action, litigation or proceeding may be heard and determined in 
such state court or, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in 
such federal court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment 
in any such action, litigation or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be 
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other 
manner provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement or in any other Credit 
Document shall affect any right that the Administrative Agent, any Lender 
or any Issuing Bank may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding 
relating to this Agreement or any other Credit Document against any Credit 
Party or its properties in the courts of any jurisdiction.

(c) Each Person party hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the 
fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any objection that it may now 
or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any action or proceeding 
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any other Credit Document 
in any court referred to in Section 11.2(b). Each of the parties hereto 
hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable 
law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action 
or proceeding in any such court.

(d) Each party hereto irrevocably consents to service of process by hand or 
overnight courier service or mailed by certified or registered mail, in 
each case to the address for notices pursuant to Section 11.4. Nothing in

in any other manner permitted by applicable law.

11.3 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO 
THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A 
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF 
OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER CREDIT DOCUMENT OR THE 
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR
 
144

------------------------------------------------------------------------
THEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY 
HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER 
PERSON HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PERSON 
WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER 
AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED 
TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER CREDIT DOCUMENTS BY, AMONG OTHER 
THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

permitted to be given by telephone (and except as provided in Section 
11.4(b)), all notices and other communications provided for herein shall be 
in writing and shall be delivered by hand or overnight courier service, 
mailed by certified or registered mail or sent by facsimile or, as provided 
in Section 11.4(b), email as follows:

or registered mail, shall be deemed to have been given when received; 
notices sent by facsimile shall be deemed to have been given when sent 
(except that, if not given during normal business hours for the recipient, 
shall be deemed to have been given at the opening of business on the next 
Business Day for the recipient). Notices delivered through electronic 
communications, to the extent provided in Section 11.4(b), shall be 
effective as provided in Section 11.4(b).

(b) Notices and other communications to the Administrative Agent, Lenders 
and any Issuing Bank hereunder may be delivered or furnished by electronic 
communication including email or by posting such notices or communications 
on internet or intranet websites such as SyndTrak or a substantially 
similar electronic transmission system (the Platform) pursuant to 
procedures approved by the Administrative Agent; provided that the 
foregoing shall not apply to notices to any Lender or Issuing Bank pursuant 
to Article II or III if such Lender or Issuing Bank, as applicable, has 
notified the Administrative Agent that it is incapable of receiving notices 
under such Article by electronic communication. Unless the Administrative 
Agent otherwise prescribes, (i) notices and other communications sent to an 
email address shall be deemed received upon the senders receipt of an 
acknowledgement from the intended recipient (such as by the return receipt 
requested function, as available, return email or other written 
acknowledgement), and (ii) notices or other communications posted to an 
internet or intranet website shall be deemed received upon the deemed 
receipt by the intended recipient at its email address as described in the 
foregoing clause (i) of notification that such notice or communication is 
available and identifying the website address therefor; provided that, for 
both clauses (i) and
 
145

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(ii) above, if such notice or other communication is not sent during the 
normal business hours of the recipient, such notice or communication shall 
be deemed to have been sent at the opening of business on the next business 
day for the recipient.

(c) THE PLATFORM IS PROVIDED AS IS AND AS AVAILABLE. The Agent Parties 
do not warrant the adequacy of the platform and expressly disclaim 
liability for errors or omissions in the communications effected thereby. 
No warranty of any kind, express, implied or statutory, including any 
warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, 
non-infringement of third-party rights or freedom from viruses or other 
code defects, is made by any Agent Party in connection with any such 
communications or the Platform. In no event shall the Administrative Agent 
or any of its Related Parties (collectively, the Agent Parties) have any 
liability to any Credit Party, any Lender or any other Person or entity for 
damages of any kind, including direct or indirect, special, incidental or 
consequential damages, losses or expenses (whether in tort, contract or 
otherwise), arising out of any Credit Partys or the Administrative Agents 
transmission of any notices or communications through the Platform, other 
than for direct or actual damages resulting from the gross negligence or 
willful misconduct of such Agent Party as determined by a final and 
nonappealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.

(d) Any party hereto may change its address or facsimile number for notices 
and other communications hereunder by notice to the other parties hereto 
(except that each Lender need not give notice of any such change to the 
other Lenders in their capacities as such).

11.5 Amendments, Waivers, etc. No amendment, modification, waiver or 
discharge or termination of, or consent to any departure by any Credit 
Party from, any provision of this Agreement or any other Credit Document 
shall be effective unless in a writing signed by the Required Lenders (or 
by the Administrative Agent at the direction or with the consent of the 
Required Lenders), and then the same shall be effective only in the 
specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given; provided, 
however, that no such amendment, modification, waiver, discharge, 
termination or consent shall:

(a) unless agreed to in writing by each Lender directly adversely affected 
thereby, (i) reduce or forgive the principal amount of any Loan or 
Reimbursement Obligation, reduce the rate of or forgive any interest 
thereon (provided that only the consent of the Required Lenders shall be 
required to waive the applicability of any post-default increase in 
interest rates), or reduce or forgive any fees hereunder (other than fees 
payable to the Administrative Agent, any Arranger or any Issuing Bank for 
its own account) (it being understood that an amendment to the definition 
of Total Leverage Ratio (or any defined terms used therein) shall not 
constitute a reduction of any interest rate or fees hereunder); (ii) extend 
the final scheduled maturity date or any other scheduled date for the 
payment of any principal of or interest on any Loan (including any 
scheduled date for the mandatory reduction or termination of any 
Commitments), extend the time of payment of any Reimbursement Obligation or 
any interest thereon, extend the expiry date of any Letter of Credit beyond 
the L/C Maturity Date, or extend the time of payment of any fees hereunder 
(other than fees payable to the Administrative Agent, any Arranger or any 
Issuing Bank for its own account), (iii) increase any Commitment of any 
such Lender over the amount thereof in effect or extend the maturity 
thereof (it being understood that a waiver of any condition precedent set 
forth in Section 4.2 or of any Default or Event of Default or mandatory
 
146

------------------------------------------------------------------------
reduction in the Commitments, if agreed to by the Required Lenders or all 
Lenders (as may be required hereunder with respect to such waiver), shall 
not constitute such an increase), or (iv) reduce the percentage of the 
aggregate Commitments or of the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the 
Loans, or the number or percentage of Lenders, that shall be required for 
the Lenders or any of them to take or approve, or direct the Administrative 
Agent to take, any action hereunder or under any other Credit Document 
(including as set forth in the definition of Required Lenders);

(b) unless agreed to in writing by all of the Lenders, (i) release all or 
substantially all of the Collateral (except as may be otherwise 
specifically provided in this Agreement (including pursuant to Section 
2.12(g)) or in any other Credit Document), (ii) release any Subsidiary 
Guarantor that is a Material U.S. Subsidiary or Foreign Credit Party from 
its obligations under the Guaranty (other than (A) as may be otherwise 
specifically provided in this Agreement or in any other Credit Document or 
(B) in connection with the sale or other disposition of all of the Capital 
Stock of such Subsidiary in a transaction expressly permitted under or 
pursuant to this Agreement), (iii) change any other provision of this 
Agreement or any of the other Credit Documents requiring, by its terms, the 
consent or approval of all the Lenders for such amendment, modification, 
waiver, discharge, termination or consent, or (iv) except as set forth in 
Section 2.22, change or waive any provision of Section 2.15, any other 
provision of this Agreement or any other Credit Document requiring pro rata 
treatment of any Lenders, or this Section 11.5;

(c) unless agreed to in writing by any Issuing Bank, the Swingline Lender, 
any Security Trustee or the Administrative Agent in addition to the Lenders 
required as provided hereinabove to take such action, affect the respective 
rights or obligations of such Issuing Bank, the Swingline Lender, such 
Security Trustee or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, hereunder or 
under any of the other Credit Documents; and

(d) unless agreed to in writing by each Hedge Party and Cash Management 
Bank that would be directly adversely affected thereby in its capacity as 
such relative to the Lenders, (i) amend the definition of Secured 
Obligations in any Security Document or the definition of Guaranteed 
Obligations in the Guaranty (or any similar defined term in any other 
Credit Document benefiting such Hedge Party), (ii) amend the definition of 
Secured Parties in any Security Document or Guaranteed Parties in the 
Guaranty (or any similar defined term in any other Credit Document 
benefiting such Hedge Party), (iii) amend any provision regarding priority 
of payments in this Agreement or any other Credit Document, (iv) release 
all or substantially all of the Collateral (except as may be otherwise 
specifically provided in this Agreement or in any other Credit Document), 
or (v) release any Subsidiary Guarantor that is a Material U.S. Subsidiary 
or Foreign Credit Party from its obligations under the Guaranty (other than 
(A) as may be otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement or in any 
other Credit Document or (B) in connection with the sale or other 
disposition of all of the Capital Stock of such Subsidiary Guarantor in a 
transaction expressly permitted under or pursuant to this Agreement).

Notwithstanding the fact that the consent of all Lenders is required in 
certain circumstances as set forth above, each Lender is entitled to vote 
as such Lender sees fit on any bankruptcy reorganization plan that affects 
the Loans, and each Lender acknowledges that the provisions of Section 
1126(c) of the Bankruptcy Code supersede the unanimous consent provisions 
set forth herein.
 
147

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) no Defaulting Lender 
shall have any right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or 
consent hereunder (and any amendment, waiver or consent which by its terms 
requires the consent of all Lenders or each affected Lender may be effected 
with the consent of the applicable Lenders other than Defaulting Lenders), 
except that (x) the Commitment of any Defaulting Lender may not be 
increased or extended without the consent of such Lender and (y) any 
waiver, amendment or modification requiring the consent of all Lenders or 
each affected Lender that by its terms treats any Defaulting Lender 
differently (in an adverse manner) than other affected Lenders shall 
require the consent of such Defaulting Lender, (ii) if the Administrative 
Agent and Crawford shall have jointly identified (each in its sole 
discretion) an obvious error or omission of a technical or immaterial 
nature, in each case, in any provision of the Credit Documents, then the 
Administrative Agent and the applicable Credit Parties shall be permitted 
to amend such provision and such amendment shall become effective without 
any further action or consent of any other party to any Credit Document if 
the same is not objected to in writing by the Required Lenders within five 
Business Days following the posting of such amendment to the Lenders and 
(iii) each cash collateral agreement or other document entered into in 
connection with an Extended Letter of Credit may be amended, or rights or 
privileges thereunder waived, in a writing executed only by the parties 
thereto.


11.6 Successors and Assigns.

(a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the 
benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns 
permitted hereby, except that no Borrower nor any other Credit Party may 
assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder 
without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent and each 
Lender and no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or 
obligations hereunder except (i) to an Eligible Assignee in accordance with 
the provisions of Section 11.6(b), (ii) by way of participation in 
accordance with the provisions of Section 11.6(e) or (iii) by way of pledge 
or assignment of a security interest subject to the restrictions of 
Section 11.6(f) (and any other attempted assignment or transfer by any 
party hereto shall be null and void). Nothing in this Agreement, expressed 
or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the 
parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, 
Participants to the extent provided in Section 11.6(e) and, to the extent 
expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the 
Administrative Agent and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy 
or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

(b) Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more Eligible Assignees all 
or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including 
all or a portion of its Commitments and the Loans (including for purposes 
of this Section 11.6(b), participations in Letters of Credit and in 
Swingline Loans) at the time owing to it); provided that any such 
assignment shall be subject to the following conditions:

(i) (A) in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the 
assigning Lenders Commitment and/or the Loans at the time owing to it or 
in the case of
 
148

------------------------------------------------------------------------
an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund, no 
minimum amount need be assigned, or (B) in any case not described in clause 
(A) above, the aggregate amount of the Commitment (which for this purpose 
includes Loans outstanding thereunder) or, if the applicable Commitment is 
not then in effect, the principal outstanding balance of the Loans of the 
assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date 
the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered 
to the Administrative Agent or, if Trade Date is specified in the 
Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade Date) shall not be less than (x) 
$5,000,000, in the case of any assignment in respect of a Commitment (which 
for this purpose includes Revolving Loans outstanding) or (y) the entire 
Swingline Commitment and the full amount of the outstanding Swingline 
Loans, in the case of Swingline Loans, in either case, treating 
contemporaneous assignments related Approved Funds under common management 
as one assignment for purposes of the minimum amounts, unless each of the 
Administrative Agent and, so long as no Default or Event of Default has 
occurred and is continuing, each Borrower otherwise consents (each such 
consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed);

(ii) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a 
proportionate part of all the assigning Lenders rights and obligations 
under this Agreement with respect to the Loan or the Commitment assigned, 
except that this Section 11.6(b)(ii) shall not apply to rights in respect 
of Swingline Loans;

(iii) no consent shall be required for any assignment except to the extent 
required by clause (B) of Section 11.6(b)(i) and, in addition:

(A) the consent of each Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably 
withheld or delayed) shall be required unless (y) an Event of Default has 
occurred and is continuing at the time of such assignment or (z) such 
assignment is to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund; 
provided that each Borrower shall be deemed to have consented to any such 
assignment unless it shall object thereto by written notice to the 
Administrative Agent within ten Business Days after having received notice 
thereof;

(B) the consent of the Administrative Agent (such consent not to be 
unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required for assignments in 
respect of a Commitment if such assignment is to a Person that is not a 
Lender, an Affiliate of such Lender or an Approved Fund with respect to 
such Lender;

(C) the consent of each Issuing Bank (such consent not to be unreasonably 
withheld or delayed) shall be required for any assignment that increases 
the obligation of the assignee to participate in exposure under one or more 
Letters of Credit (whether or not then outstanding); and

(D) the consent of the Swingline Lender (such consent not to be 
unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required for any assignment in 
respect of a Commitment;
 
149

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(iv) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the 
Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a 
processing and recordation fee of $3,500 for each assignment and the 
assignee, if it is not a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent 
an Administrative Questionnaire; provided that in the case of an assignment 
to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund no such fee shall 
be required;

(v) no such assignment shall be made to (A) Crawford or any of its 
Affiliates or Subsidiaries or (B) any Defaulting Lender or any of its 
Subsidiaries, or any Person who, upon becoming a Lender hereunder, would 
constitute any of the foregoing Persons described in this clause (B); and

(vi) no such assignment shall be made to a natural person (or a holding 
company, investment vehicle or trust for, or owned and operated for the 
primary benefit of, a natural person) or a Disqualified Lender.

Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent 
pursuant to Section 11.6(c), from and after the effective date specified in 
each Assignment and Assumption, the assignee thereunder shall be a party to 
this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such 
Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender 
under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the 
extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be 
released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an 
Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lenders rights and 
obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party 
hereto) but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 
2.16(a), 2.16(b), 2.17, 2.18 and 11.1 with respect to facts and 
circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment; 
provided that, except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the 
affected parties, no assignment by a Defaulting Lender will constitute a 
waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from such 
Lenders having been a Defaulting Lender. If requested by or on behalf of 
the assignee, each Borrower, at its own expense, will execute and deliver 
to the Administrative Agent a new Note or Notes to the order of the 
assignee (and, if the assigning Lender has retained any portion of its 
rights and obligations hereunder, to the order of the assigning Lender), 
prepared in accordance with the applicable provisions of Section 2.4 as 
necessary to reflect, after giving effect to the assignment, the 
Commitments and/or outstanding Loans, as the case may be, of the assignee 
and (to the extent of any retained interests) the assigning Lender, in 
substantially the form of Exhibits A-1 and A-2, as applicable. Any 
assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this 
Agreement that does not comply with this Section 11.6(b) shall be treated 
for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation 
in such rights and obligations in accordance with Section 11.6(e).

(c) In connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any 
Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective unless 
and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, 
the parties to the assignment shall make such additional payments to the 
Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution 
thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the 
assignee of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating 
actions, including funding, with the consent of each Borrower and the 
Administrative Agent, the applicable pro rata share of Loans
 
150

------------------------------------------------------------------------
previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting Lender, to each of 
which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to 
(x) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such 
Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder (and 
interest accrued thereon), and (y) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its 
full pro rata share of all Loans and participations in Letters of Credit 
and Swingline Loans in accordance with its Credit Exposure. Notwithstanding 
the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations 
of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective under applicable 
Law without compliance with the provisions of this paragraph, then the 
assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all 
purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs.

(d) The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of 
each Borrower, shall maintain at its address for notices referred to in 
Schedule 1.1(a) a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it 
and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the 
Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts (and stated 
interest) of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof 
from time to time (the Register). The entries in the Register shall be 
conclusive absent manifest error, and each Borrower, the Administrative 
Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the 
Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all 
purposes of this Agreement. In addition, the Administrative Agent shall 
maintain on the Register information regarding the designation, revocation 
of designation, of any Lender as a Defaulting Lender. The Register shall be 
available for inspection by each Borrower and Issuing Bank, at any 
reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. In 
addition, at any time that a request for a consent for a material or 
substantive change to the Credit Documents is pending, any Lender wishing 
to consult with other Lenders in connection therewith may request and 
receive from the Administrative Agent a copy of the Register.

(e) Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, any 
Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person 
(other than a natural person or any Borrower or any of the Borrowers 
respective Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a Participant) in all or a 
portion of such Lenders rights and/or obligations under this Agreement 
(including all or a portion of its Commitments and/or the Loans (including 
such Lenders participations in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans) 
owing to it); provided that (i) such Lenders obligations under this 
Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely 
responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such 
obligations and (iii) the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent, the Lenders, 
the Issuing Banks and the Swingline Lender shall continue to deal solely 
and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lenders rights and 
obligations under this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, each Lender 
shall be responsible for the indemnity under Section 11.1(c) with respect 
to any payments made by such Lender to its Participant(s). Any agreement or 
instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall 
provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this 
Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any 
provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may 
provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, 
agree to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in Section 
11.5(a) and clause (i) of Section 11.5(b) that adversely affects such 
Participant. Each Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled 
to the benefits of Sections 2.16(a), 2.16(b), 2.17 and 2.18 (subject to the 
requirements and limitations therein, including the
 
151

------------------------------------------------------------------------
requirements under Section 2.17(g); it being understood that the 
documentation required under Section 2.17(g) shall be delivered to the 
participating Lender) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had 
acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to Section 11.6(b); provided 
that such Participant (A) agrees to be subject to the provisions of 
Section 2.19 as if it were an assignee under Section 11.6(b) and (B) shall 
not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.16 or 2.17, 
with respect to any participation, than its participating Lender would have 
been entitled to receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive 
a greater payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the 
Participant acquired the applicable participation. Each Lender that sells a 
participation agrees, at any Borrowers request and expense, to use 
reasonable efforts to cooperate with such Borrower to effectuate the 
provisions of Section 2.19 with respect to any Participant. To the extent 
permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits 
of Section 9.3 as though it were a Lender; provided that such Participant 
agrees to be subject to Section 2.15(b) as though it were a Lender. Each 
Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as 
an agent of each Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name 
and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated 
interest) of each Participants interest in the Loans or other Obligations 
under the Credit Documents (the Participant Register); provided that no 
Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the 
Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any 
information relating to a Participants interest in any Commitments, Loans, 
Letters of Credit or its other obligations under any Credit Document) to 
any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to 
establish such Commitment, Loan, Letter of Credit or other obligation is in 
registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury 
Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive 
absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name 
is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation 
for all purposes of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the 
Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have 
no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.

(f) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all 
or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including under its 
Notes, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge 
or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided 
that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its 
obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such 
Lender as a party hereto.

(g) The words execution, signed, signature, and words of like import 
in any Assignment and Assumption shall be deemed to include electronic 
signatures or the keeping of records in electronic form, each of which 
shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability as a manually 
executed signature or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the 
case may be, to the extent and as provided for in any applicable law, 
including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce 
Act or any state laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act.

(h) Any Lender or Participant may, in connection with any assignment, 
participation, pledge or proposed assignment, participation or pledge 
pursuant to this Section 11.6, disclose to the assignee, Participant or 
pledgee or proposed assignee, Participant or pledgee any information 
relating to the Consolidated Entities furnished to it by or on behalf of 
any other party hereto;
 
152

------------------------------------------------------------------------
provided that such assignee, Participant or pledgee or proposed assignee, 
Participant or pledgee agrees in writing to keep such information 
confidential to the same extent required of the Lenders under Section 11.11
.

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if Wells 
Fargo assigns all of its Commitments and Revolving Loans in accordance with 
this Section 11.6, Wells Fargo may resign as an Issuing Bank upon written 
notice to the Borrowers and the Lenders. Upon any such notice of 
resignation, Crawford shall have the right to appoint from among the 
Lenders a successor Issuing Bank; provided that no failure by Crawford to 
make such appointment shall affect the resignation of Wells Fargo as an 
Issuing Bank. Wells Fargo shall retain all of the rights and obligations of 
an Issuing Bank hereunder with respect to all Letters of Credit issued by 
it and outstanding as of the effective date of its resignation and all 
obligations of the Borrowers and the Lenders with respect thereto 
(including the right to require the Lenders to make Revolving Loans or fund 
participation interests pursuant to Article III).


(j) Disqualified Lenders.

(i) No assignment or participation shall be made to any Person that was a 
Disqualified Lender as of the date (the Trade Date) on which the 
assigning Lender entered into a binding agreement to sell and assign or 
participate all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this 
Agreement to such Person (unless Crawford has consented to such assignment 
or participation in writing in its sole and absolute discretion, in which 
case such Person will not be considered a Disqualified Lender for the 
purpose of such assignment or participation). For the avoidance of doubt, 
with respect to any assignee that becomes a Disqualified Lender after the 
applicable Trade Date (including as a result of the delivery of a notice 
pursuant to, and/or the expiration of the notice period referred to in, the 
definition of Disqualified Lender), (x) such assignee shall not 
retroactively be disqualified from becoming a Lender and (y) the execution 
by Crawford of an Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignee 
will not by itself result in such assignee no longer being considered a 
Disqualified Lender. Any assignment in violation of this Section 11.6(j)(i) 
shall not be void, but the other provisions of this Section 11.6(j) shall 
apply.

(ii) If any assignment or participation is made to any Disqualified Lender 
without Crawfords prior written consent in violation of Section 11.6(j)(i)
, or if any Person becomes a Disqualified Lender after the applicable Trade 
Date, Crawford may, in addition to any rights and remedies it may have with 
respect to the assigning or participating Lenders breach of this 
Agreement, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to the applicable 
Disqualified Lender and the Administrative Agent, (A) terminate any 
Commitment of such Disqualified Lender and repay all obligations of the 
Borrowers owing to such Disqualified Lender in connection with such 
Commitment and/or (B) require such Disqualified Lender to assign, without 
recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in 
this Section 11.6(j)), all of its interest, rights and obligations under 
this Agreement to one or more Eligible Assignees at the lesser of (x) the 
principal amount thereof and (y) the amount that such Disqualified Lender 
paid to acquire such interests, rights and obligations, in each case plus 
accrued interest, accrued fees and all other amounts (other than principal 
amounts) payable to it hereunder.
 
153

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, 
Disqualified Lenders (A) will not (x) have the right to receive 
information, reports or other materials provided to any Lenders by any 
Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any other Lender, (y) attend or 
participate in meetings attended by the Lenders and the Administrative 
Agent or (z) access any electronic site established for the Lenders or 
confidential communications from counsel to or financial advisors of the 
Administrative Agent or the Lenders and (B) (x) for purposes of any consent 
to any amendment, waiver or modification of, or any action under, and for 
the purpose of any direction to the Administrative Agent or any Lender to 
undertake any action (or refrain from taking any action) under this 
Agreement or any other Credit Document, each Disqualified Lender will be 
deemed to have consented in the same proportion as the Lenders that are not 
Disqualified Lenders consented to such matter and (y) for purposes of 
voting on any plan of reorganization or plan of liquidation pursuant to any 
Debtor Relief Laws (each, a Plan), each Disqualified Lender party hereto 
hereby agrees (1) not to vote on such Plan, (2) if such Disqualified Lender 
does vote on such Plan notwithstanding the restriction in the foregoing 
clause (1), such vote will be deemed not to be in good faith and shall be 
designated pursuant to Section 1126(e) of the Bankruptcy Code (or any 
similar provision in any other Debtor Relief Laws), and such vote shall not 
be counted in determining whether the applicable class has accepted or 
rejected such Plan in accordance with Section 1126(c) of the Bankruptcy 
Code (or any similar provision in any other Debtor Relief Laws), and (3) 
not to contest any request by any party for a determination by the 
Bankruptcy Court (or other applicable court of competent jurisdiction) 
effectuating the foregoing clause (2).

(iv) The Administrative Agent shall have the right, and each Borrower 
hereby expressly authorizes the Administrative Agent, to provide the list 
of Disqualified Lenders provided by Crawford and any updates thereto from 
time to time (collectively, the DQ List) to each Lender.

11.7 No Waiver. The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the 
Security Trustees and the Lenders expressly set forth in this Agreement and 
the other Credit Documents are cumulative and in addition to, and not 
exclusive of, all other rights and remedies available at law, in equity or 
otherwise. No failure or delay on the part of the Administrative Agent, any 
Security Trustee or any Lender in exercising any right, power or privilege 
shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise 
of any such right, power or privilege preclude other or further exercise 
thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege or be 
construed to be a waiver of any Default or Event of Default. No course of 
dealing between any Credit Party, the Administrative Agent, the Security 
Trustees or the Lenders or their agents or employees shall be effective to 
amend, modify or discharge any provision of this Agreement or any other 
Credit Document or to constitute a waiver of any Default or Event of 
Default. No notice to or demand upon any Credit Party in any case shall 
entitle any Credit Party to any other or further notice or demand in 
similar or other circumstances or constitute a waiver of the right of the 
Administrative Agent, any Security Trustee or any Lender to exercise any 
right or remedy or take any other or further action in any circumstances 
without notice or demand.
 
154

------------------------------------------------------------------------
11.8 Survival. All representations, warranties and agreements made by or on 
behalf of any Credit Party in this Agreement and in the other Credit 
Documents shall survive the execution and delivery hereof or thereof, the 
making and repayment of the Loans and the issuance and repayment of the 
Letters of Credit. In addition, notwithstanding anything herein or under 
applicable law to the contrary, the provisions of Section 2.8(f) and the 
provisions of this Agreement and the other Credit Documents relating to 
indemnification or payment of costs and expenses, including the provisions 
of Sections 2.16(a), 2.16(b), 2.17, 2.18 and 11.1, shall survive the 
payment in full of all Loans and Letters of Credit, the termination of the 
Commitments and all Letters of Credit, and any termination of this 
Agreement or any of the other Credit Documents.

11.9 Severability. To the extent any provision of this Agreement is 
prohibited by or invalid under the applicable law of any jurisdiction, such 
provision shall be ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or 
invalidity and only in such jurisdiction, without prohibiting or 
invalidating such provision in any other jurisdiction or the remaining 
provisions of this Agreement in any jurisdiction. Without limiting the 
foregoing provisions of this Section 11.9, if and to the extent that the 
enforceability of any provisions in this Agreement relating to Defaulting 
Lenders shall be limited by Debtor Relief Laws, as determined in good faith 
by the Administrative Agent, any Security Trustee, any Issuing Bank or the 
Swingline Lender, as applicable, then such provisions shall be deemed to be 
in effect only to the extent not so limited.

11.10 Construction. The headings of the various articles, sections and 
subsections of this Agreement and the table of contents have been inserted 
for convenience only and shall not in any way affect the meaning or 
construction of any of the provisions hereof. Except as otherwise expressly 
provided herein and in the other Credit Documents, in the event of any 
inconsistency or conflict between any provision of this Agreement and any 
provision of any of the other Credit Documents, the provision of this 
Agreement shall control. Any Hedge Agreement between any Borrower and any 
Hedge Party is an independent agreement governed by the writing provisions 
of such Hedge Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect, 
unaffected by any repayment, prepayment, acceleration, reduction, increase 
or change in the terms applicable to the Loans under this Agreement, except 
as otherwise expressly provided in such Hedge Agreement, and any payoff 
statement from the Administrative Agent relating to this Agreement shall 
not apply to such Hedge Agreement except as expressly provided therein. Any 
Cash Management Agreement between any Borrower and any Cash Management Bank 
is an independent agreement governed by the written provisions of such Cash 
Management Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect, 
unaffected by any repayment, prepayment, acceleration, reduction, increase 
or change in the terms applicable to the Loans under this Agreement, except 
as otherwise expressly provided in such Cash Management Agreement, and any 
payoff statement from the Administrative Agent relating to this Agreement 
shall not apply to such Cash Management Agreement except as expressly 
provided therein.

11.11 Confidentiality. Each of the Administrative Agent, the Security 
Trustees, the Lenders and the Issuing Banks agrees to maintain the 
confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that 
Information may be disclosed (i) to its Affiliates and to its Related 
Parties (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is 
made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and 
instructed to keep such Information confidential); (ii) to the extent 
required or requested by any regulatory authority purporting to have 
jurisdiction over such Person or its Related Parties (including any 
self-regulatory authority, such as the National Association of Insurance 
Commissioners), except that no disclosure of any
 
155

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Information of the kind referred to in Section 275(1) of the PPSA is 
permitted unless Section 275(7) of the PPSA applies); (iii) to the extent 
required by applicable Requirements of Law or by any subpoena or similar 
legal process (in which case, such Persons agree, to the extent permitted 
by law, to inform Crawford promptly in advance thereof); (iv) to any other 
party hereto; (v) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder 
or under any other Credit Document or any Hedge Agreement or any Cash 
Management Agreement or any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement 
or any other Credit Document or any Hedge Agreement or any Cash Management 
Agreement or the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder; (vi) 
subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as 
those of this Section 11.11, to (A) any assignee of or Participant in, or 
any prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights and 
obligations under this Agreement or (B) any actual or prospective party (or 
its Related Parties) to any swap, derivative or other transaction under 
which payments are to be made by reference to any Borrower and its 
obligations, this Agreement or payments hereunder; (vii) on a confidential 
basis, to (A) any rating agency in connection with any Borrower or its 
Subsidiaries or the facilities created hereunder or (B) the CUSIP Service 
Bureau or any similar agency in connection with the issuance monitoring of 
CUSIP numbers with respect to the facilities created hereunder; (viii) with 
the consent of each Borrower; or (ix) to the extent such Information (A) 
becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this 
Section 11.11 or (B) becomes available to the Administrative Agent, any 
Security Trustee, any Lender, any Issuing Bank or any of their respective 
Affiliates on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than any 
Borrower.

For purposes of this Section 11.11, Information means all information 
received from the Consolidated Entities relating to any Consolidated Entity 
or any of their respective businesses, other than any such information that 
is available to the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank on 
a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by any Consolidated Entity, 
provided that, in the case of any received from any Consolidated Entity 
after the date hereof, such information is clearly identified at the time 
of delivery as confidential. Any Person required to maintain the 
confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section 11.11 shall be 
considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has 
exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such 
Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential 
information.

11.12 Judgment Currency. If for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any 
court it is necessary to convert a sum due from any Borrower hereunder in 
the currency expressed to be payable herein (the specified currency) into 
another currency, the parties hereto agree, to the fullest extent that they 
may effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used shall be that at 
which, in accordance with normal banking procedures, the Administrative 
Agent could purchase the specified currency with such other currency at the 
Administrative Agents main Charlotte, North Carolina, office on the 
Business Day preceding that on which final, non-appealable judgment is 
given. The obligations of each Borrower in respect of any sum due to any 
Lender, any Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent hereunder shall, 
notwithstanding any judgment in a currency other than the specified 
currency, be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day 
following receipt by such Lender, such Issuing Bank or the Administrative 
Agent (as the case may be) of any sum adjudged to be so due in such other 
currency such Lender, such Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent (as the 
case may be) may in accordance with normal, reasonable banking procedures 
purchase the specified currency with such other currency. If the
 
156

------------------------------------------------------------------------
amount of the specified currency so purchased is less than the sum 
originally due to such Lender, such Issuing Bank or the Administrative 
Agent, as the case may be, in the specified currency, each Borrower agrees, 
to the fullest extent that it may effectively do so, as a separate 
obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify such Lender, 
such Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, against 
such loss, and if the amount of the specified currency so purchased exceeds 
(i) the sum originally due to any Lender, any Issuing Bank or the 
Administrative Agent, as the case may be, in the specified currency and 
(ii) any amounts shared with other Lenders as a result of allocations of 
such excess as a disproportionate payment to such Lender under Section 
2.15(b), then such Lender, such Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent, 
as the case may be, agrees to remit such excess to such Borrower.

11.13 Obligations of Foreign Borrowers. Notwithstanding anything in this 
Agreement or any other Credit Document to the contrary, none of the Foreign 
Subsidiary Borrowers nor any other Foreign Subsidiary of Crawford (other 
than Disregarded Foreign Subsidiaries that are Credit Parties) shall be 
liable or in any manner responsible for, or be deemed to have guaranteed, 
directly or indirectly, whether as a primary obligor, guarantor, 
indemnitor, or otherwise, and none of their assets shall secure, directly 
or indirectly, any obligations (including principal, interest, fees, 
penalties, premiums, expenses, charges, reimbursements, indemnities or any 
other U.S. Obligations) in respect of any U.S. Credit Party or Disregard 
Foreign Subsidiary under this Agreement, any other Credit Document, any 
Hedge Agreement, any Cash Management Agreement or any other agreement 
executed and/or delivered in connection with any of the foregoing.


11.14 Joint and Several Liability for Foreign Subsidiary Obligations.

(a) The Borrowers are jointly and severally liable for the Foreign 
Subsidiary Obligations. The Obligations of the Borrowers are independent of 
each other, and a separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted 
against any Borrower to enforce this Agreement, irrespective of whether any 
action is brought against any other Borrower or whether any other Borrower 
is joined in any such action or actions.

(b) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein or in 
any other of the Credit Documents, to the extent the obligations of any 
Borrower to repay any Obligations incurred by any other Borrower shall be 
adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason (including 
because of any Debtor Relief Laws) then the obligations of such Borrower 
hereunder shall be limited to the maximum amount that is valid and 
enforceable under applicable law (whether federal, state or provincial and 
including Debtor Relief Laws).

(c) Each Borrower unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees the payment of 
any and all Foreign Subsidiary Obligations whether or not due or payable by 
the Borrowers upon the occurrence of any of the events specified in 
Section 9.1(f) or 9.1(g), and unconditionally promises to pay such Foreign 
Subsidiary Obligations to the Administrative Agent or the applicable 
Security Trustee for the account of the Lenders, on demand. Each Borrower 
further agrees that to the extent that any Borrower or Subsidiary Guarantor 
shall make a payment or a transfer of an interest in any property to the 
Administrative Agent, any Security Trustee or any Lender, which payment or 
transfer or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be 
fraudulent or preferential, or otherwise is avoided, and/or required to be 
repaid to such Borrower
 
157

------------------------------------------------------------------------
or Subsidiary Guarantor, the estate of such Borrower or Subsidiary 
Guarantor, a trustee, receiver or any other party under any bankruptcy law, 
state or federal law, common law or equitable cause, then to the extent of 
such avoidance or repayment, the obligation or part thereof intended to be 
satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if 
said payment had not been made.

(d) With respect to the Foreign Subsidiary Obligations, the liability of 
each Borrower hereunder is exclusive and independent of any security for or 
other guaranty of the indebtedness of the other Borrowers and such 
Borrowers liability hereunder shall not be affected or impaired by (i) any 
direction as to application of payment by any other Borrower or by any 
other party; (ii) any other continuing or other guaranty, undertaking or 
maximum liability of a guarantor or of any other party as to the 
indebtedness of any other Borrower; (iii) any payment on or in reduction of 
any such other guaranty or undertaking; (iv) any dissolution, termination 
or increase, decrease or change in personnel by any other Borrower; or (v) 
any payment made to the Administrative Agent, any Security Trustee or any 
Lender with respect to the Foreign Subsidiary Obligations that the 
Administrative Agent, such Security Trustee or such Lender subsequently 
repay to any other Borrower pursuant to court order in any proceeding under 
any Debtor Relief Law, and such Borrower waives any right to the deferral 
or modification of its obligations hereunder by reason of any such 
proceeding. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the 
aggregate liability of the Consolidated Entities under the Credit Documents 
shall not exceed the aggregate amount of the Obligations.

(e) With respect to the Foreign Subsidiary Obligations, each Borrower 
authorizes the Administrative Agent, each Security Trustee and each Lender 
without notice or demand (except as shall be required by applicable statute 
and cannot be waived), and without affecting or impairing its liability 
hereunder, from time to time to (i) renew, compromise, extend, increase, 
accelerate or otherwise change the time for payment of, or otherwise change 
the terms of the Foreign Subsidiary Obligations or any part thereof in 
accordance with this Agreement, including any increase or decrease of the 
rate of interest thereon; (ii) take and hold security from any guarantor or 
any other party for the payment of the Foreign Subsidiary Obligations and 
exchange, enforce, waive and release any such security; (iii) apply such 
security and direct the order or manner of sale thereof as the 
Administrative Agent, the Security Trustees and the Lenders in their 
discretion may determine; and (iv) release or substitute any one or more 
endorsers, guarantors, Borrowers or other obligors.

(f) With respect to the Foreign Subsidiary Obligations and to the fullest 
extent permitted under applicable law, each Borrower hereby waives any 
right to require the Administrative Agent, any Security Trustee or any 
Lender to (i) proceed against any Borrower, any other guarantor or any 
other party; (ii) proceed against or exhaust any collateral, Cash 
Collateral or other security held from any Borrower, any other guarantor, 
any Defaulting Lender or any other party, or (iii) pursue any other remedy 
in the Administrative Agents, any Security Trustees, or any Lenders 
power whatsoever. With respect to the Foreign Subsidiary Obligations, each 
Borrower waives any defense based on or arising out of any defense of any 
other Borrower, any other guarantor or any other party other than the 
satisfaction in full of the Termination Requirements, including any defense 
based on or arising out of the disability of any other Borrower, any other 
guarantor or any other party, or the unenforceability of the Foreign 
Subsidiary Obligations or any part thereof from any cause, or the cessation 
from any cause of the
 
158

------------------------------------------------------------------------
liability of any other Borrower other than the satisfaction in full of the 
Termination Requirements. The Administrative Agent, any Security Trustee or 
any Lender may, at its election, foreclose on any security held by the 
Administrative Agent, any Security Trustee or any Lender by one or more 
judicial or nonjudicial sales, whether or not every aspect of any such sale 
is commercially reasonable (to the extent such sale is permitted by 
applicable law), or exercise any other right or remedy the Administrative 
Agent, any Security Trustee or any Lender may have against any Borrower or 
any other party, or any security, without affecting or impairing in any way 
the liability of any Borrower hereunder except to the extent the Foreign 
Subsidiary Obligations have been paid. Each Borrower waives any defense 
arising out of any such election by the Administrative Agent, any Security 
Trustee or any Lender, even though such election operates to impair or 
extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or 
remedy of any Borrower against any other Borrower or any other party or any 
security.

(g) With respect to the Foreign Subsidiary Obligations, each Borrower 
waives all presentments, demands for performance, protests and notices, 
including notices of nonperformance, notices of protest, notices of 
dishonor, notices of acceptance, and notices of the existence, creation or 
incurring of new or additional indebtedness. Each Borrower assumes all 
responsibility for being and keeping itself informed of the Borrowers 
financial condition and assets, and of all other circumstances bearing upon 
the risk of nonpayment of the Foreign Subsidiary Obligations and the 
nature, scope and extent of the risks which each Borrower assumes and 
incurs hereunder, and agrees that neither the Administrative Agent, any 
Security Trustee nor any Lender shall have any duty to advise any Borrower 
of information known to it regarding such circumstances or risks.

(h) With respect to the Foreign Subsidiary Obligations, each Borrower 
hereby agrees it will not exercise any rights of subrogation which it may 
at any time otherwise have (whether contractual, under Section 509 of the 
Bankruptcy Code, or otherwise) to the claims of the Lenders against any 
other Borrower or any other guarantor of the Foreign Subsidiary Obligations 
of any Borrower owing to the Lenders and all contractual, statutory or 
common law rights of reimbursement, contribution or indemnity from any such 
party that it may at any time otherwise have until such time as (i) the 
Foreign Subsidiary Obligations hereunder have been paid (other than any 
indemnification obligations and obligations under Hedge Agreements, in each 
case not due and payable), (ii) the Commitments have been terminated and 
(iii) the termination and settlement of all obligations of all Borrowers 
under each Hedge Agreement to which any such Borrower and any Hedge Party 
are parties (collectively, the Termination Requirements). Each Borrower 
hereby further agrees not to exercise any right to enforce any other remedy 
which the Administrative Agent, the Security Trustees and the Lenders now 
have or may hereafter have against any party liable on any Foreign 
Subsidiary Obligations, any endorser or any other guarantor of all or any 
part of the Foreign Subsidiary Obligations of any Borrower and any benefit 
of, and any right to participate in, any security or collateral given to or 
for the benefit of the Lenders to secure payment of the Foreign Subsidiary 
Obligations of any Borrowers until such time as the Termination 
Requirements shall have been satisfied.

(i) Each Borrower agrees that all indebtedness and other obligations, 
whether now or hereafter existing, of any Credit Party to such Borrower, 
including any intercompany receivables, together with any interest thereon, 
shall be, and hereby are, subordinated and made junior in right of payment 
to the Obligations. Each Borrower further agrees that if any amount
 
159

------------------------------------------------------------------------
shall be paid to or any distribution received by it (i) on account of any 
such indebtedness at any time after the occurrence and during the 
continuance of an Event of Default, or (ii) on account of any such rights 
of subrogation, indemnity, contribution or reimbursement at any time prior 
to the satisfaction of the Termination Requirements, such amount or 
distribution shall be deemed to have been received and to be held in trust 
for the benefit of the Lenders, and shall forthwith be delivered to the 
Administrative Agent or the applicable Security Trustee (as applicable) in 
the form received (with any necessary endorsements in the case of written 
instruments), to be applied against the Obligations, whether or not 
matured, in accordance with the terms hereof or the applicable Credit 
Documents and without in any way discharging, limiting or otherwise 
affecting the liability of such Borrower under any other provision of this 
Agreement.

11.15 Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be 
executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto in different 
counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which 
when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement and 
the other Credit Documents constitute the entire contract among the parties 
relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous 
agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject 
matter hereof (except for the Fee Letter). Except as provided in Section 
4.1, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed 
by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have 
received counterparts hereof that, when taken together, bear the signatures 
of each of the other parties hereto. Delivery of an executed counterpart of 
a signature page of this Agreement by facsimile or in electronic format 
(e.g., pdf or tif file format) shall be effective as delivery of a 
manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

11.16 Disclosure of Information. Each Borrower agrees and consents to the 
Administrative Agents and the Arrangers disclosure of information 
relating to this transaction to Gold Sheets and other similar bank trade 
publications. Such information will consist of deal terms and other 
information customarily found in such publications.

11.17 Patriot Act Notice. Each Lender and the Administrative Agent (for 
itself and not on behalf of any Lender), in each case to the extent it is 
subject to the PATRIOT Act, hereby notifies each Borrower that pursuant to 
the requirements of the PATRIOT Act, it is required to obtain, verify and 
record information that identifies such Borrower, which information 
includes the name and address of such Borrower and other information that 
will allow such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, to 
identify such Borrower in accordance with the PATRIOT Act.

11.18 Australian Code of Banking Practice. Each of the parties hereto 
agrees that the Australian Code of Banking Practice does not apply to this 
Agreement or the transactions in connection with it.

11.19 Ontario Limitations Act. Each of the parties hereto agree that any 
and all limitation periods provided for in the Limitations Act, 2002 
(Ontario) shall be excluded from application to the Obligations and any 
undertaking, covenant, indemnity or other agreement of any Credit Party 
provided for in any Credit Document to which it is a party in respect 
thereof, in each case to fullest extent permitted by such Act.
 
160

------------------------------------------------------------------------
11.20 Amendment and Restatement; No Novation. This Agreement constitutes an 
amendment and restatement of the Existing Credit Agreement, effective from 
and after the Closing Date. The execution and delivery of this Agreement 
shall not constitute a novation of any indebtedness or other obligations 
owing to the Lenders or the Administrative Agent under the Existing Credit
