HGV LICENSE AGREEMENT

This HGV LICENSE AGREEMENT dated as of                      2016 (the 
Effective Date), by and between Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc., a Delaware 
corporation (Licensor and Hilton Grand Vacations Inc., a Delaware 
corporation (Licensee). Each of Licensor and Licensee is referred to 
herein as a Party and collectively, as the Parties.


W I T N E S S E T H:

WHEREAS, Licensor, Park Hotels & Resorts Inc., a Delaware corporation (
PHRI) and Licensee entered into that certain Distribution Agreement, dated 
as of                      (the Distribution Agreement), pursuant to 
which Licensor will be separated into three independent, publicly traded 
companies; and

WHEREAS, Licensor, directly or indirectly, owns the Licensed IP and 
possesses the Hilton Data (as defined herein) and Licensee wishes to use 
the Licensed IP and Hilton Data in its Vacation Ownership Business after 
the Effective Date, and Licensor is willing to grant Licensee such a 
license on the terms and conditions herein.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual agreements 
and covenants contained in this Agreement, the Parties hereby agree as 
follows:


ARTICLE I

LICENSES

Section 1.1. Trademark License.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions herein, during the Term, Licensor 
hereby grants to Licensee a license to use the Licensed Marks as Trademarks 
in the Territory in connection with the current and future operation of the 
Licensed Vacation Ownership Business. Such license shall be exclusive for 
the Term. For clarity, (i) the above license covers only the exact Licensed 
Marks, and Licensee may not use the term Hilton standing alone or, except 
as permitted by the Licensor Brand Identity Guidelines any variations, 
derivatives, abbreviations or stylizations of the Licensed Marks, in each 
case, without Licensors prior written consent, and (ii) the above 
exclusivity means that, during the Term, Licensor will not use (or allow 
others to use) the Licensed Marks in connection with the Licensed Vacation 
Ownership Business.

(b) Without the prior written consent of Licensor, Licensee shall not (i) 
bid for, purchase, register or use the term Hilton or any other Trademark 
owned by Licensor or its Subsidiaries as or as part of any key word, ad 
word, metatag or similar device designed to attract viewers or users in 
online, social, mobile or other media or (ii) link to or frame any website, 
online, social or mobile media property or venue of Licensor that Licensee 
is not already linking to or framing as of the Effective Date, regardless 
of whether the foregoing constitutes trademark use under applicable Laws.

(c) Licensee hereby grants to Licensor and its Subsidiaries a non-exclusive 
sublicense during the Term to (i) use the Licensed Marks and (ii) use and 
exercise the intellectual property rights in the Licensed Content, in each 
case, to the extent necessary to advertise and promote the Licensed 
Vacation Ownership Business on Licensees behalf during the Term. Licensee 
may further sublicense the above license in connection with the foregoing.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Section 1.2. Content License. Subject to the terms and conditions herein, 
during the Term, Licensor hereby grants to Licensee a license to use, 
reproduce, distribute, perform and display the Licensed Content in the 
Territory solely in connection with the current and future operation of the 
Licensed Vacation Ownership Business. Such license shall be exclusive for 
the Noncompetition Term and non-exclusive for the remainder of the Term. 
Licensee may modify Licensed Content for format or technical reasons, but 
may not make substantive or artistic changes thereto, without Licensors 
prior written consent.

Section 1.3. Software Licenses.

(a) Licensor hereby at its option (i) grants to Licensee a non-exclusive 
sublicense or (ii) agrees to cause an Affiliate to grant to Licensee a 
non-exclusive license, in each case, during the Term to use the Licensed 
Software in connection with the Licensed Vacation Ownership Business. 
Licensee shall comply with all terms and conditions of the applicable 
license or sublicense (which shall be equivalent in all material respects 
to the then-current version of the Hilton Information Technology System 
Agreement) in connection with such use.

(b) Licensor hereby grants to Licensee the non-exclusive right during the 
Term to access the Licensed System and provide the Licensed System with 
information as to the current inventory of vacant rooms at Licensed 
Vacation Ownership Properties.

Section 1.4. Data Access. Subject to the terms and conditions herein, 
Licensor hereby grants to Licensee the rights to use the Hilton Data as set 
forth in Section 14.2(b).

Section 1.5. Marketing Rights. Subject to the terms and conditions herein, 
during the Noncompetition Term, Licensor hereby grants to Licensee the 
right to market the Licensed Vacation Ownership Business at Licensors 
corporate-level advertising channels, including websites and social media 
properties (but not the channels of individual Hilton-branded properties). 
Such right is exclusive, meaning that during the Noncompetition Term, 
Licensor will not allow any other Person to market a Vacation Ownership 
Business through such channels.

Section 1.6. Brand Displays. Licensor acknowledges and agrees that during 
the Noncompetition Term, Licensor shall, wherever legally permissible, 
include (i) the Licensed Mark Hilton Grand Vacations on its brand bar, 
and similar displays where Licensor advertises all of the Hilton Marks for 
the Licensor Lodging Business and (ii) inventory of transient rentals for 
the Licensed Vacation Ownership Properties in all proprietary and 
third-party advertising venues that list such inventory for the Licensor 
Lodging Business, in each case, in the same manner and quality Licensor 
provided prior to the Effective Date of this Agreement.


ARTICLE II

EXCLUSIVITY AND RESERVED RIGHTS

Section 2.1. [Intentionally Omitted].

Section 2.2. Exclusivity.

(a) Until December 31, 2046 (the Initial Noncompetition Term), Licensor 
will not: (x) engage or license any Person to engage in the Vacation 
Ownership Business worldwide under any Trademark; (y) use or license any 
Person to use the Licensed IP or Hilton Data in connection with the 
Vacation Ownership Business; and/or (z) allow any Person engaged in the 
Vacation Ownership Business, other than Licensee, to participate in the 
Loyalty Program.
 
2

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(b) The Initial Noncompetition Term shall be extended for additional 
10-year terms (each 10-year term, a Renewal Noncompetition Term and 
together with the Initial Noncompetition Term, the Noncompetition Term), 
if Licensee satisfies the criteria in either clause (i) or (ii) below in 
calendar year 2046 (or the final calendar year of any Renewal 
Noncompetition Term) (each, a Measuring Year):

(i) Licensees Gross Revenues in a Measuring Year must be equal to or 
greater than 80% of $1,493,000,000 USD (Licensees 2016 projected Gross 
Revenues) as inflated to such Measuring Year dollars by the CPI Adjustment. 
For example, if Licensee had 2016 Gross Revenues of $100 USD, and that 
translated into $300 in projected Gross Revenues in 2046 due to CPI 
Adjustments, Licensees minimum 2046 revenue to renew the Noncompetition 
Term until December 31, 2056 would be $240; or

(ii) Licensee must generate the sum of the Gross Sales Price and Fee For 
Services Sales Price in a Measuring Year that rank first, second or third 
among Vacation Ownership Business worldwide, based on revenues disclosed in 
audited financial reports for such Measuring Year (or a comparable 
mutually-agreed metric, if such annual contract sales are no longer 
publicly reported).

(c) If Licensee does not satisfy clause (i) or (ii) during a Measuring 
Year, Licensee may retain the Noncompetition Term for one year terms by 
paying Licensor 5% of the shortfall between Licensees actual Gross 
Revenues for the Measuring Year and 100% of Licensees projected Gross 
Revenues for the Measuring Year as set forth in clause (i) (each, a 
Shortfall Payment). The Shortfall Payment shall be due within 30 days 
after the end of the Measuring Year. For example, if Licensee had 2016 
Gross Revenues of $100, and that translated into $300 in projected Gross 
Revenues in 2046 due to CPI Adjustments, and Licensees Gross Revenues were 
$220 in 2046, that would be a shortfall of $80, and Licensee would submit a 
Shortfall Payment of $80 times 5% for the Royalty, or $4.

(d) Licensee shall be allowed a maximum of five consecutive Shortfall 
Payments during any Renewal Noncompetition Term, with no carryover of 
unused Shortfall Payments into the next Renewal Noncompetition Term. If 
during any year of noncompetition afforded by a Shortfall Payment, Licensee 
satisfies clause (i) or (ii), the Noncompetition Term shall be extended by 
a 10-year Renewal Noncompetition Term beginning at the end of the prior 
Measuring Year. For example, if Licensees Gross Revenues are $220 in 2046, 
Licensee would make the above $4 Shortfall Payment for 2046, and if in 2047 
Licensees Gross Revenues meet the target, the Noncompetition Term would 
renew until December 31, 2056. If after five consecutive Shortfall 
Payments, Licensee fails to satisfy clauses (i) or (ii), the Noncompetition 
Term expires on December 31st in the year in which the last Shortfall 
Payment was made.

(e) If the Noncompetition Term terminates under Section 2.2(a) or Section 
2.6(a), Licensor shall notify Licensee of same in writing. Thereafter, 
Licensee will continue to be bound by its obligations in this Agreement 
including Article IX, but Licensor may (and may assist or allow other 
Persons to) engage in the Vacation Ownership Business in any form and under 
any Trademark (other than HGV and Hilton Grand Vacations) worldwide for 
the remainder of the Term.

Section 2.3. Licensors Reserved Rights. Licensor reserves all rights not 
expressly licensed to Licensee hereunder, including without limitation, the 
right to Operate any business or properties and/or use the Licensed IP and 
Hilton Data in any manner that does not violate Licensees exclusive rights 
herein. Licensor may sell, assign or license the Hilton Marks (other than 
the Licensed Marks) without Licensees consent, and any acquirer, assignee 
or licensee shall have no obligation to Licensee herein.
 
3

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Section 2.4. Licensees Reserved Rights. Licensee reserves the right to 
engage in any activity worldwide not expressly prohibited in this 
Agreement.

Section 2.5. Similar Lines of Business. Licensee may engage in the 
Fractional Vacation Club Business and the Whole Ownership Business, as a 
Separate Operation (or as part of the Licensed Vacation Ownership Business, 
subject to Licensors prior written consent), at any time during the Term. 
Licensor may engage in the Fractional Vacation Club Business and the Whole 
Ownership Business at any time during the Term.

Section 2.6. Licensor Transactions.

(a) Notwithstanding Section 2.2(a), if at any time during the 
Noncompetition Term, Licensor merges with or acquires direct or indirect 
Control of a Person that operates a Vacation Ownership Business as well as 
a Lodging Business (in either an equity or asset acquisition), Licensor 
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to allow Licensee to acquire or 
manage such acquired Vacation Ownership Business (the Acquired Vacation 
Business) as a Licensed Vacation Ownership Business herein. For the 
avoidance of doubt, Licensor has no obligation to include Licensee in any 
pre-closing discussions or negotiations with the third-party counter-party 
and may elect to present Licensee with the opportunity to acquire or manage 
the Acquired Vacation Business only after closing of the business 
transaction and, in either case, Licensor may proceed with the transaction 
whether or not Licensee acquires or manages the Acquired Vacation Business. 
For the avoidance of doubt, during the Noncompetition Term Licensor may not 
merge with or acquire direct or indirect Control of a Person that operates 
solely a Vacation Ownership Business.

(b) If Licensee does not acquire or manage the acquired Vacation Ownership 
Business: (i) Licensor shall have no further obligations to include 
Licensee in the ownership or management of the Acquired Vacation Business; 
(ii) Licensor may merge its Loyalty Program with the loyalty program of the 
Acquired Vacation Business and, notwithstanding the exclusivity and 
non-competition provisions herein, compete in the Vacation Ownership 
Business using the Hilton IP (but not the Licensed Marks), Hilton Data and 
the Loyalty Program in connection with such Acquired Vacation Business; and 
(iii) during the Noncompetition Term, Licensor shall use Reasonable Best 
Efforts to continue to provide Licensee the Licensed IP and Hilton Data on 
a basis comparable to Licensors past practice under this Agreement.

(c) If, on the closing date for the acquisition of the Acquired Vacation 
Business, 90% of all ownership interests, use rights, or other entitlements 
to use overnight accommodations in the Vacation Ownership Properties within

FEES

Section 3.1. Royalty Fees.

(a) (i) Licensee shall pay to Licensor a royalty (the Royalty) for the 
rights granted to Licensee under this Agreement in an amount equal to five 
percent (5%) of Gross Revenues.

(ii) Except for the limited exception for Non-Licensed Existing Projects 
below, if Licensee develops Vacation Ownership Properties or acquires 
Vacation Ownership Properties from a Person other than a Hilton Competitor 
and they are not operated as Separate Operations, the Royalty shall apply 
to such Vacation Ownership Properties as if they were Licensed Vacation 
Ownership Properties, even if such properties are not Licensed Vacation 
Ownership Properties. The Royalty shall also apply to all Transient Rental 
Revenue at any Vacation Ownership Properties that use the Licensed IP or 
Hilton Data. For clarity, Licensee shall not owe a Royalty arising out of 
its Vacation Ownership Properties that are operated as Separate Operations.

(iii) If Licensee permits Non-Licensed Existing Projects, or other 
non-licensed Vacation Ownership Properties with which Licensee has entered 
into a Marketing Agreement pursuant to Section 9.6(d), to be exchanged 
pursuant to an arrangement between the Licensed Exchange Program and a 
non-licensed Exchange Program whereby individual owners of the non-licensed 
Vacation Ownership Properties do not have full access to the Loyalty 
Program through the Licensed Exchange Program, then the Royalty shall be 
due only on the applicable Club Revenue portion of the Gross Revenue. If 
Hilton Data is used to market the sale of units at Non-Licensed Existing 
Projects, then the Royalty shall be due on Gross Sales Price, Club Revenue, 
and Marketing Package Revenues.

(b) A sale occurs for Royalty purposes with respect to the initial sale or 
re-sale of an interest in a Licensed Vacation Ownership Property when all 
of the following conditions have been satisfied, regardless of when, or 
whether, any part of the Gross Sales Price or Fee For Services Sales Price 
are actually paid to, or received by or on behalf of, Licensee.

(i) A written agreement (Purchase Contract) is executed by a purchaser 
and has been accepted by Licensee pursuant to which such purchaser 
contractually commits to acquire such interest;

(ii) With respect to purchase money financing provided by or through 
Licensee or its Affiliates, if any, such purchaser has duly executed all 
applicable sales and purchase money financing documents in respect of such 
Purchase Contract;

(iii) Such purchaser has duly tendered payment of the full purchase price 
in respect of such Purchase Contract (or full installments thereof in the 
case of purchase money financing, as applicable) by cash, by check which 
has cleared, or by credit card which has been duly processed) to either (x) 
Licensee or its Affiliates or (y) a fiduciary, escrow agent, trustee or 
other independent third-party designated by Licensee or its Affiliates, as 
may be required by applicable Laws;

(iv) All rescission periods applicable to such Purchase Contract have 
expired, without any such right of rescission having been exercised; and
 
5

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(v) All pre-conditions set forth in such Purchase Contract and any legal 
requirements under the applicable Laws in order to close the transaction 
which is the subject of the Purchase Contract as set forth in such Purchase 
Contract shall have been duly satisfied, without the purchaser having 
exercised any right of cancellation afforded such purchaser under the terms 
of such Purchase Contract or under the applicable Laws.

(vi) To the extent that the sale of a Licensed Vacation Ownership Property 
meets (i) through (v) above, but such Licensed Vacation Ownership Property 
has not achieved a Certificate of Occupancy granted by relevant 
municipalities that approve the use by a purchaser of the Licensed Vacation 
Ownership Property, the sale for Royalty purposes will be multiplied by the 
Percentage of Completion. The Percentage of Completion will be calculated 
and applied to such Licensed Vacation Ownership Property each reporting 
period until such time that the Licensed Vacation Ownership Property 
achieves its Certificate of Occupancy, at which time and for all periods 
thereafter, the Percentage of Completion will be 100%.

(c) The Gross Sales Price or Fee For Services Sales Price shall, for 
purposes of calculating the Royalty under Section 3.1(a), exclude the 
amount attributable to a gross up for imputed interest associated with a 
zero percent (0%) or below market interest rate program used in relation to 
financing a purchasers acquisition of interests in a Licensed Vacation 
Ownership Property, but only where the Gross Sales Price or Fee For 
Services Sales Price is offered at different amounts to the customers on a 
programmatic basis, depending on the financing or payment terms selected by 
the customer.

Section 3.2. Additional Fees. In addition to the Royalty, Licensee shall 
pay to Licensor:

(a) An annual transition fee for the first five years of the Term of $5 
million per year.

(b) The then-current Loyalty Program fee for eligible guest folios, subject 
to caps in place as of the Effective Date for a period of twenty (20) years 
from the Effective Date. At the end of such twenty (20) year period, the 
caps will be eliminated and Licensee will pay the same Loyalty Program fee 
that is in effect for Licensor Lodging Properties.

Section 3.3. Other Costs. Licensee shall pay Licensor fees covering 
Licensors proportionate costs for Licensees use of the Licensed Software. 
Licensee shall pay the non-refundable, up-front installation costs (if any)

Vacation Ownership Properties, which shall include sales centers that are 
not in existence as of the Effective Date.

Section 3.4. Reimbursement. Licensee shall reimburse Licensor for its costs 
(without profits) that would typically be covered by the Program Fee, 
including marketing campaigns in which Licensee participates under Section 
9.5 or Section 9.6 below or enhancements to the Licensed Software that are 
provided to all of Licensor Lodging Properties, provided that Licensee will 
pay such costs only for services that Licensee uses. Licensee shall also 
reimburse Licensor for all costs associated with Call transfer services, 
GBCS Services used by Licensee, central delivery used by Licensee, third 
party reservation charges, guest assistance services and the handling of 
guest complaints, whether such guests are Loyalty Program members or not.

Section 3.5. Licensee Forecasts. At least one month prior to the end of 
each of Licensors fiscal years during the Term, Licensee shall provide to 
Licensor a forecast of its projected Royalties and Gross Revenues 
(separated by the categories in the definition of Gross Revenues herein) 
for Licensors upcoming fiscal year, and then after each fiscal year 
quarter during the Term, Licensee shall provide to Licensor the actual 
Royalties and Gross Revenues for such prior quarter and an updated rolling 
forecast of outstanding quarterly royalties for the remainder of Licensors 
then current fiscal year.

this Article III shall be paid within thirty (30) days following the end of 
each calendar quarter. All other payments herein shall be made within 
thirty (30) days after receipt of an invoice from Licensor. Licensee shall 
pay via a wire transfer (or other method reasonably designated by Licensor) 
of immediately available funds, pursuant to Licensors commercially 
reasonable instructions. All amounts payable to Licensor shall be invoiced 
in U.S. dollars unless Licensor otherwise designates another currency. The

international reporting service. Licensee shall submit to Licensor, within 
eight (8) business days after the end of each month, a statement in the 
form reasonably required by Licensor that includes all Information required 
by Licensor to determine all due payments hereunder, and on a quarterly 
basis, such statement will also aggregate the amounts presented on the 
monthly statement itemizing the various revenue streams to Licensor that 
constitute the Royalty. Such Information is not Licensees Confidential 
Information and Licensor may use or disclose it for authorized business 
purposes.

Section 3.7. Interest on Late Payments. If a Party does not make any 
payment due under this Agreement within fourteen (14) days after its due 
date, such Party shall pay interest from the due date until the date of 
payment compounded monthly, at the interest rate of an annual rate equal to 
the lesser of (i) the prime rate (as published by the Wall Street Journal 
or, if no longer published, such other similar source as reasonably 
selected by Licensor) applicable on the date such payment is due and on 
each date thereafter that interest is compounded, plus eight (8) percentage 
points and (ii) the highest rate then permitted by applicable Laws.

Section 3.8. Currency and Taxes. Licensee shall bear and be responsible for 
all taxes, duties and deductions (including any sales, value added, use, 
excise, gross receipts, income, goods and service taxes, stamp or other 
duties, fees, deductions, withholdings or other payments, and including 
penalties and interest as a result of failure to comply) (collectively, 
Taxes) levied on, deducted or withheld from, or assessed or imposed on any 
payments made by Licensee hereunder. If Licensor or its designee pays any 
such amounts due, then Licensee must reimburse Licensor therefor. Licensee 
shall gross-up all payments herein so that Licensor receives the same 
amount that it would have received if no Taxes were applicable.

Section 5.2. New Projects.

(a) If Licensee notifies Licensor that it wishes to develop additional 
Vacation Ownership Properties that use Hilton Marks (other than the 
Licensed Marks) either alone or as co-branding with any Licensed Marks, it 
shall notify Licensor in writing by submitting to Licensor a written

additional Vacation Ownership Properties that would use the Licensed Marks 
or (ii) expand the scope or size of an existing Licensed Vacation Ownership 
Property (if such expansion was not included in the original proposal for 
the property approved by Licensor), it shall notify Licensor in writing by 
submitting to Licensor a written application that contains all material 
information with respect thereto. Licensor shall not unreasonably withhold 
its approval for such Vacation Ownership Properties to use the Licensed IP 
and Hilton Data (and upon such approval, such properties shall become 
Licensed Vacation Ownership Properties herein) if the proposed additional 
Vacation Ownership Property or proposed expansion to an existing Licensed 
Vacation Ownership Property (each, a New Property) and Licensees 
intended operation thereof complies with the then-current Standards and 
Agreements and:

(i) the development of the proposed New Property would not breach, or be 
reasonably likely to breach, any applicable Laws or agreement between 
Licensor or its Affiliates, including territorial restrictions or areas of 
protection;

(ii) the proposed New Property will not involve any co-investor that (a) is 
a Hilton Competitor, (b) is known in the community as being of bad moral 
character, (c) has been convicted in any court of a felony or other offense

Controlled by Persons who have been convicted in any court of felonies or 
such offenses), or (d) is (or has an Affiliate that is) a Blocked Person;

the Licensed IP, the Hilton Data or the goodwill associated therewith.

(c) Licensor shall provide the plans and specifications for each New 
Project to Licensor for review and inspection to ensure that they are in 
compliance with this Agreement and the Standards and Agreements. Licensee 
shall pay Licensor a fixed fee for such review. Notwithstanding such review 
and inspection, as between the Parties, Licensee is responsible for 
ensuring that all aspects of each New Project comply with all applicable 
Laws, this Agreement and the Standards and Agreements, and Licensor 
disclaims all liability for any of same.

or rights therein) to any Person other than a Hilton Competitor, Licensee 
will notify Licensor, and for thirty (30) days after such notice, the 
Parties shall negotiate in good faith towards a sale agreement. If no such 
agreement is executed in such time period, for 270 days thereafter, 
Licensee shall be free to execute such sale with such Person, so long as 
the sale price is at least 95% of the sale price proposed to Licensor. 
Licensee shall promptly provide Licensor with all information reasonably 
requested by Licensee to confirm Licensees compliance with this Section 
5.3(b).

(c) If Licensee wishes to sell an Undeveloped Parcel (or any part thereof 
or rights therein) to a Hilton Competitor, Licensee will notify Licensor, 
and Licensor shall have a right of first refusal on such purchase for 30 
days, on the same terms set forth in the offer from the Hilton Competitor. 
If the third party offer provides for payment of consideration other than 
cash, Licensor may offer commercially reasonable cash equivalent.

(d) Licensee agrees that any purported transaction in violation of 
Licensors rights in this Section 5.3 shall be deemed null and void at the 
outset and of no force or effect, and Licensor shall be entitled to 
equitable relief, including rescission, to effect such nullification.

Section 5.4. Projects at Third-Party Hotels. Licensee shall not participate 
in a New Property that is a mixed-use development project (whether or not

Hilton Competitors without Licensors prior written consent, except for 
those projects set forth on Exhibit K.

Section 5.5. Future Franchise and Management Agreements. Licensor will use 
commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that any third-party management,

provisions to ensure that third party hotel owners and franchisees do not 
(and do not allow other Persons to) operate, promote or sell interests in 
Vacation Ownership Properties other than Licensed Vacation Ownership 
Properties in connection with such Licensor Lodging Property; and (ii) if 
executed as of the Effective Date, retain the above-described provisions, 
if such retention can be achieved with no material concession or liability 
by Licensor. Licensor shall not be liable to Licensee for any failure to 
obtain the above provisions, if it exercises the above commercially 
reasonable efforts in this regard.

Section 5.6. Vacation Ownership Properties at Licensor Lodging Properties.

(a) If a third-party developer of a Licensor Lodging Property intends to 
develop a Vacation Ownership Property as a component thereof (the 
Co-Located Licensor Lodging Property), Licensor will notify Licensee and 
use commercially reasonable efforts to allow Licensee to negotiate with 
such developer to Operate the Vacation Ownership Property as a Licensed 
Vacation Ownership Property. If, despite such efforts, such counterparty 
does not offer Licensee such opportunity, Licensor shall have no further 
obligations to Licensee in this regard (but Licensors obligations during 
the Noncompetition Term shall still apply).

(b) If Licensor engages in a mixed-use project that includes a Vacation 
Ownership Property, Licensor will use commercially reasonable efforts to 
include Licensee in same, and if Licensee is not included, Licensor shall 
not allow the Hilton Data or the Loyalty Program to be used to conduct 
direct marketing activities with respect to the above Vacation Ownership 
Business component (but shall have no other restriction on the use of 
Hilton Data or Loyalty Program for such projects).

applicable to Licensor that relate to the Licensed Vacation Ownership 
Business and are in effect as of the Effective Date (or thereafter, subject 
to Licensees consent). Licensor will not agree to an extension of the 
duration, or a broadening of the scope, of any such restrictions without 
Licensees prior written consent (which shall be required only during the 
Noncompetition Term), except for extending or renewing such agreements in 
accordance with their terms. Licensee shall not enter into any agreement

to any Person, or use the Licensed IP for the direct or indirect benefit of 
any other Person, without Licensors prior written consent.

(c) Licensee may also sublicense the Licensed Marks to Licensed HOAs, 
solely to the extent necessary for their operation. Licensee shall ensure 
that all Licensed HOAs include all information and terms reasonably 
requested by Licensor (in a form approved by Licensor) in their sales 
offering documents, sale, deed and other agreements with potential buyers, 
including provisions that (i) Licensor is a third-party beneficiary with 
the right to enforce such terms directly against the Licensed HOA and buyer 
and (ii) the intended buyer is not acquiring any rights in or to use any 
Licensed IP or Hilton Data. Licensee shall obtain Licensors prior written 
consent before signing any agreement with respect to the creation, 
operation, title, deed or sales provisions of any Licensed HOA. Licensee

Section 5.9. Limited Lodging Operations by Licensee. Notwithstanding the 
prohibition on Licensee operating a Lodging Business in Section 9.1, 
Licensee may:

(a) On a limited basis, engage in the transient rental of inventory of 
Vacation Ownership Properties that are held for development and sale and 
owned by Licensee, its Affiliates, an HOA or a third party with which 
Licensee or its Affiliates has entered into a development agreement or 
management agreement (together, Licensee Parties) or that is controlled 
by Licensee, its Affiliates or an HOA as a result of a Vacation Ownership 
Property owner default pending foreclosure or cure in the ordinary course 
of business, in each case, solely to support Licensees Vacation Ownership 
Business. Licensee agrees that all Licensed Vacation Ownership Properties 
transient rental inventory shall be made available through the Licensed 
System and shall not be placed on any third party platforms or distribution 
channels.

(b) In the event Licensee acquires a hotel, resort or other transient or 
extended stay lodging facilities for the purpose of converting such 
facilities into a Vacation Ownership Property, Licensee may during such 
conversion process operate such facilities, or a significant portion 
thereof, as a hotel provided Licensee shall pursue such conversion in a 
commercially reasonable manner so as to limit Licensees competition with 
Licensor in the Lodging Business. The parties agree Licensees obligation 
in this regard shall be met if Licensee diligently pursues the conversion 
and has commenced bona fide sales of Vacation Ownership Property intervals 
within 24 months of Licensees obtaining ownership, control or management 
of such property. If the Licensee fails to commence bona fide sales of 
Vacation Ownership Property intervals within the 24-month period, Licensee

jeopardizes (or could reasonably be expected to materially harm or 
jeopardize) the value, validity, reputation or goodwill of the Licensed IP.

Section 7.2. Modified Standards.

(a) Licensor may modify or implement any existing or new Standards during 
the Term, effective upon notice to Licensee, provided that (i) Licensor may 
not require Licensee to comply with any Standards that, as a whole, place a 
disproportionate or discriminatory burden upon Licensee relative to 
practices for similarly situated Licensor Lodging Properties, but Licensee 
acknowledges that certain Standards may not apply to all of Licensors 
branded hotels and (ii) Licensee shall have a commercially reasonable time 
to transition to comply with the above new Standards (unless new or 
modified Standards reflect changes in applicable Laws, in which case, 
Licensee must adopt such changes sufficiently promptly to comply with such 
Laws).
 
11

Ownership Properties related to other Loyalty Program members.

Program Points for nightly stays at Licensed Vacation Ownership Properties.

loyalty program (or purchase and use loyalty program points) of a Hilton

at the beginning of each calendar year during such 20 year period. 
Thereafter, (i) Licensor shall cause HHonors LLC to sell Loyalty Program 
Points to Licensee at the market rate (which shall not be (x) less than 
cost or (y) more than the amount paid by any other Person participating in 
the Loyalty Program who buys the similar quantity of points on the same 
terms and is otherwise similarly situated to Licensee), provided that such 
market rate is no higher than the price per point paid by any strategic 
partner that purchases a comparable volume of points annually on comparable 
business terms from HHonors LLC. During the Term and in accordance with the 
restrictions in this Article VII, HHonors LLC shall be entitled to increase 
the price per point on an annual basis.

delegated or subcontracted in accordance with the Brand Standards. Licensee 
may subcontract or delegate both property-level and management functions to 
(i) a Subsidiary without notice to or consent of Licensor or (ii) any other 
Person, with Licensors prior written consent not to be unreasonably 
withheld. Licensor hereby consents to the subcontracting and delegation 
agreements set forth on Exhibit L.

(b) Licensee shall require all sublicensees (and all Persons referenced in 
Section 8.3(a)) to agree in writing to abide by all terms herein relating 
to the Standards and Agreements and protection of the Licensed IP, and 
Licensee is liable to Licensor hereunder for any act or omission by a 
sublicensee or a Person referenced in Section 8.3(a) that would breach this 
Agreement if committed by Licensee. A Party may not license or authorize 
any Person (including Subsidiaries) to take any action that such Party is 
prohibited from doing under this Agreement, and each Party is liable 
hereunder for any action by a Subsidiary that would breach this Agreement 
if committed by such Party.

Section 8.4. Quality Assurance.

(a) Subject to any pre-existing third-party agreements prohibiting same, 
Licensor and its representatives have the right (but not the obligation) to 
enter the Licensed Vacation Ownership Properties at any time without notice 
or additional permission from Licensee to verify that Licensee is complying 
with this Agreement and the Standards and Agreements. Licensee shall 
provide commercially reasonable assistance to facilitate such inspections 
and promptly (or immediately, for material deficiencies or issues involving 
health or safety) take all actions necessary to correct any deficiencies 
found during any inspection. If Licensor is required to conduct more than 
one (1) inspection in any twelve (12) month period because of Licensees 
failure to comply with the Standards and Agreements or this Agreement, 
Licensee shall reimburse Licensor for the commercially reasonable 
out-of-pocket costs of such additional inspections. The results of such 
inspection are Licensors Confidential Information, and Licensor may use 
and disclose them for authorized business purposes.

(b) Licensors representatives who travel to the Licensed Vacation 
Ownership Properties to perform design review, training, inspections, 
assistance or other services shall be permitted, subject to availability, 
to stay at the relevant Licensed Vacation Ownership Property and use its 
facilities (including commercially reasonable food and beverage 
consumption) without charge.

Section 8.5. Licensed HOAs Not Controlled By Licensee. If any Licensed HOA 
not Controlled by Licensee operates or maintains a Licensed Vacation 
Ownership Property in a manner that would constitute a Deflagging Event or 
an action set forth in Section 18.3 of this Agreement if committed by 
Licensee, Licensee shall promptly notify the Licensed HOA of such failure 
and request the same be cured within thirty (30) days. If such failure is 
not susceptible to being cured during such 30 day period, Licensee may 
extend such cure period for such additional periods as is reasonable under 
the circumstances if cure is being diligently pursued, and in no event will 
such period be more than one year from the date of the initial notice 
without Licensors prior written consent. If the Licensed HOA cannot effect 
cure within such time (or an extension thereof, which requires Licensors 
prior written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld), then Licensee 
shall immediately Deflag such Licensed Vacation Ownership Property, and the 
provisions of Section 18.1 shall apply.
 
14

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Section 8.6. Employee Discounts. Licensors employees may stay at the 
Licensed Vacation Ownership Properties (and Licensees employees may stay 
at the Licensor Lodging Properties) for other business or non-business 
purposes at reduced rates (such rates also covering food and beverage 
costs), subject to the terms and conditions contained in the Employee 
Matters Agreement dated as of the date hereof among the Parties, Park 
Hotels & Resorts Inc. and Hilton Domestic Operating Company Inc. (the 
Employee Matters Agreement). Licensees employees may enjoy discounts 
consistent with Licensors then-current discount offers to its own 
employees for in-room amenities, in accordance with the Standards and 
Agreements and the Employee Matters Agreement. If Licensor so requests in 
writing, Licensors employees may enjoy discounts consistent with 
Licensees then-current discount offers to Licensees own employees to 
purchase units in Licensed Vacation Ownership Properties.

Section 8.7. Managers. Each Party shall give the other Party notice of one 
representative to act as such Partys primary contact(s) with respect to 
the various performance areas and obligations in this Agreement. Each Party 
may change one or more of its primary contacts in accordance with the 
procedures set forth in Article XXIII. The Parties contacts shall fully 
cooperate to perform this Agreement and meet regularly or as needed.

or indirect Control of a business that is not a Vacation Ownership Business 
or Lodging Business (in either an equity or asset acquisition), and 
Licensee may (i) operate such new business as Separate Operations or (ii) 
use the Licensed IP in connection with such new business, subject to 
Licensors prior written consent.

(b) Without Licensors prior written consent, Licensee may acquire direct 
or indirect Control of Vacation Ownership Properties (in either an equity 
or asset acquisition) that have never been branded with any Hilton Marks, 
and Licensee may operate such Vacation Ownership Properties as (i) Separate 
Operations or (ii) new Licensed Vacation Ownership Properties, subject to 
all terms and conditions herein regarding same.
 
15

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Section 9.4. New Products and Services. Licensee may develop or acquire 
products or services that are not in the Vacation Ownership Business but 
are substantially similar to products and services being offered at the 
time by other Persons who operate a business described in clause (i) of the 
definition of Vacation Ownership Business of quality similar to Licensee: 
(i) as Separate Operations or (ii) subject to Licensors prior written 
consent, as part of the Licensed Vacation Ownership Business.

Section 9.5. Advertising.

(a) Licensee shall, at its cost and expense, advertise and promote the 
Licensed Vacation Ownership Business, in all venues and media, in a 
first-class, dignified manner, in compliance with all Standards and 
Agreements and this Agreement. Licensee shall ensure that all advertising 
and promotional materials used in connection with the Licensed Vacation 
Ownership Business, in any form or media (Marketing Content) comply with 
all applicable Laws and the Standards and Agreements. Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, Licensee may continue to use all Marketing Content that Licensee 
has used prior to the Effective Date, to the extent such Marketing Content 
is consistent with the Standards and Agreements, and will not violate any 
Standards and Agreements by such use. Licensor has the right to review (on 
a periodic basis), and Licensee shall respond to Licensors commercially 
reasonable requests to submit to Licensor any new Marketing Content that 
differs materially from that used by Licensee as of the Effective Date. 
Licensee shall promptly revise or cease using any Marketing Content after 
it becomes aware (whether from notice from Licensor or otherwise) that it 
does not comply with this Agreement, the Standards and Agreements (subject 
to this Section 9.5(a)) or applicable Laws.

(b) The Parties will cooperate to facilitate advertising the Licensed 
Vacation Ownership Properties in Licensors distribution channels, and 
develop and exploit new Marketing Content and channels to support the 
Licensed Vacation Ownership Business, provided that, in each case, Licensor 
has sole discretion as to any specific advertising activities.

(c) The Parties will coordinate all marketing activities provided under 
this Agreement, including online demand generation, Internet keyword 
purchasing and email marketing (and future successors and equivalents of 
the foregoing), so as to prevent current and prospective customers from 
declining to receive marketing for Licensor and/or the Loyalty Program.

Section 9.6. Sponsorships/Partnerships.

(a) The Parties shall meet quarterly during the Term to discuss future 
Marketing Content and any sponsorship, marketing, endorsement or similar 
agreements (Marketing Agreements) for the Licensed Vacation Ownership 
Business between the Parties and their advertisers.

(b) If Licensor wishes to enter into any Marketing Agreement on an 
exclusive basis, and such exclusivity would restrict the Licensed Vacation 
Ownership Business, Licensor shall notify Licensee (i) at the quarterly 
meeting or (ii) for time-sensitive matters, at least 30 days prior to 
executing same. In each case, Licensor shall consult with Licensee and in 
good faith consider Licensees comments with respect to such agreement; 
however, for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 9.6(b) shall 
give Licensee the right to block or delay any such exclusive marketing 
agreement. Licensor shall have the sole right to approve and execute any 
such exclusive Marketing Agreements that involve the Licensed Marks. 
However, should Licensor request Licensee participate in a marketing or 
similar agreement with respect to co-branded credit cards, and such 
arrangement includes a bounty fee or similar payment by the issuer for 
acquisitions at Licensees Vacation Ownership Properties, Licensee shall 
not be required to participate in such marketing activates unless Licensee 
receives a share of such payment.
 
16

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(c) Licensee shall ensure that all marketing activities, Marketing Content 
and Marketing Agreements entered into in connection with the Licensed 
Vacation Ownership Business comply with all applicable Laws and the 
Standards and Agreements and, absent the prior written consent of Licensor, 
do not involve a Hilton Competitor. Licensee shall not use any of the 
Licensed Marks or participate in a Marketing Agreement that may subject 
Licensor to public ridicule, criticism or controversy or that may 
substantially tarnish Licensors goodwill.

(d) Licensee may continue to perform under all Marketing Agreements that 
Licensee has entered into in writing and made available to Licensor for 
review prior to the Effective Date. Licensor acknowledges that Licensee has 
prior to the Effective Date entered into certain Marketing Agreements or 
other arrangements designed to support the Licensed Exchange Program with 
Hilton Competitors, a list of which is attached hereto as Exhibit M. Should 
Licensee desire to enter into a new Marketing Agreement or other 
arrangement with a Hilton Competitor, or materially expand the scope of 
such an existing arrangement, Licensee must first obtain Licensors prior 
written consent.

(e) Licensee may enter into new local Marketing Agreements and 
enterprise-wide Marketing Agreements at any time, subject to Licensors 
prior written approval for all enterprise-wide Marketing Agreements and any 
new local Marketing Agreement that differs materially from that used by 
Licensee as of the Effective Date. Licensee shall notify Licensor of all 
proposed new Marketing Agreements (i) at the quarterly meeting or (ii) for 
time-sensitive matters, at least 30 days prior to the signing date. 
Licensor shall not unreasonably withhold its approval for any Marketing 
Agreement that does not involve a Hilton Competitor. In each case, Licensee 
shall consult with Licensor and in good faith consider Licensors comments 
with respect to such agreement. Should Licensor determine, in its 
reasonable discretion, that a Marketing Agreement does not comply with this 
Agreement, the Standards and Agreements (subject to this Section 9.6(e)) or

shall terminate such Marketing Agreement. Licensee shall respond to 
Licensors reasonable requests to submit to Licensor any Marketing Content.

LICENSOR SERVICES

Section 11.1. Call Center Transfer Services. The Parties have executed the 
Marketing Services Agreement, effective as of the Effective Date (the 
Marketing Services Agreement), which shall govern the transfer of Calls 
from Licensor to Licensee. The Marketing Services Agreement shall at a 
minimum provide that:

(i) it shall terminate automatically, if the Noncompetition Term expires or 
terminates (either standing alone or if this Agreement terminates in its 
entirety);

(ii) Licensor shall have no service level obligations or required minimums 
for transferred Calls; however, for ten years after the Effective Date, 
Licensor shall use Reasonable Best Efforts to transfer Calls to Licensee at 
a level consistent with past practice prior the Effective Date as adjusted 
in good faith to reflect, among other facts and circumstances that could 
affect the overall value proposition of the Marketing Services Agreement, 
overall call volume, changes to the demographic mix of callers and changes 
in customers preference or willingness to be presented with Licensed 
Vacation Ownership offers;

(iii) For three years after the Effective Date, Licensors existing call 
center procedures shall not be changed in a way that negatively and 
materially affects the order in which Calls are forwarded by Licensor to 
third parties, including Licensee; and

(iv) Licensor shall provide the Call transfer services described therein at 
cost for the first 30 years and at market rates thereafter.

All other terms and conditions with respect to such Call transfers shall be 
set forth in the Marketing Services Agreement.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

Section 13.1. Ownership/New Marks.

(a) Licensor, together with its Affiliates, is the sole owner of all 
Licensed IP, and Licensee will not file to register, register, patent, 
maintain or renew any of same. Licensee will not directly or indirectly 
attack, contest or otherwise challenge the validity, enforceability or 
ownership of any Licensed IP or Hilton Data. Notwithstanding the foregoing, 
if Licensee is deemed to be the owner of any Licensed
 
18

------------------------------------------------------------------------
IP (or own any rights in any Hilton Data), Licensee hereby assigns and 
agrees to assign to Licensor all of such rights in same. Unless Licensee 
has notified Licensor that it no longer requires the use of any Licensed 
Marks, Licensor shall continue to maintain and renew all Licensed Marks 
(and file and use Reasonable Best Efforts to prosecute until registration 
all new Licensed Marks approved hereunder), so long as Licensee 
reimburses Licensor for all commercially reasonable out-of-pocket costs 
incurred.

(b) Without limiting Section 13.1(a), Licensor agrees that Licensee may (i) 
serve as the administrative and technical contact for all domain names and 
social or mobile media registrations included in the Licensed Marks, 
provided that Licensor shall be the registrant of any such domain names 
(and social or mobile media registrations, if and to the extent the 
trademark owner is intended to be the registrant) and (ii) file to register 
corporate, trade, d/b/a and similar names containing the Licensed Marks, so 
long as any such registration does not modify or compromise Licensors 
ownership rights in the Licensed Marks.

(c) If Licensee wishes to use a Licensed Mark in a country or jurisdiction 
for which it is not registered as of the Effective Date, it may notify 
Licensor of same. The Parties will cooperate to perform all necessary due 
diligence with respect to Licensees proposed use. Licensor shall not 
withhold its consent to any proposed new Trademark if the new Trademark, in 
Licensors good-faith judgment, would not reasonably be expected to harm or 
jeopardize the value, validity, reputation or goodwill of the Licensed 
Marks or subject Licensor to any risk of legal liability or an adverse 
Action anywhere in the world. Any new Trademark approved by Licensor 
hereunder shall be owned by Licensor and deemed to be a Licensed Mark 
hereunder.

Section 13.2. Licensees Use of Licensed IP.

(a) Licensee shall use all Licensed IP solely in compliance with applicable 
Laws and all Standards and Agreements. Licensee will use all notices and 
legends for the Licensed IP that are required by applicable Laws or 
reasonably requested by Licensor.

(b) Licensee acknowledges that Licensor may change the stylization, font or 
appearance of the Licensed Marks during the Term. Licensee must use the 
latest version of the Licensed Marks that Licensor has adopted for its own 
use, subject to a commercially reasonable transition period during which 
Licensee may engage in traditional phase out use of the prior version of 
the Licensed Marks.

(c) Licensee may use the Trademarks of third parties in connection with 
permitted marketing activities in the ordinary course of business in the 
Licensed Vacation Ownership Business, provided that, without Licensors 
prior written consent (whether provided in connection with the Parties 
marketing activities in Section 9.5 or Section 9.6 or otherwise), Licensee 
shall not use (i) the Licensed Marks with any other Trademark in such a 
manner so as to suggest (a) a co-branded, combined or composite Trademark 
or (b) that Licensor is affiliated with, endorses or sponsors the owner of 
such Trademark; or (ii) the Trademarks of any Hilton Competitor in the 
Licensed Vacation Ownership Business.

Section 13.3. Enforcement. If Licensee learns of any actual or threatened 
unauthorized use of the Licensed IP by any Person, Licensee shall promptly 
notify Licensor. Licensor, in its sole discretion, shall decide whether to 
commence an Action against such use. If Licensor elects not to bring an 
Action and such unauthorized use is materially impairing Licensees rights 
under this Agreement, Licensor shall not unreasonably refuse a request by 
Licensee to bring an Action in its own name. If Licensor refuses such a 
request, Licensee may not bring such an Action. If Licensor grants such a 
request, Licensor may participate in such Action with counsel of its own 
choice at its own expense. The Parties may also elect in their discretion 
to bring a joint Action. The Parties shall fully cooperate in any such 
Action brought in this Section 13.3. Absent a joint Action or later 
agreement to the contrary, the Party that brings any
 
19

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Action herein shall control its prosecution, pay all costs and expenses 
associated therewith and have the sole right to any and all damages, 
settlements and proceeds therefrom; provided that a Party shall not enter 
into any settlement or other agreement that would impose any liability or 
obligations or have any adverse effect upon on the other Party without its 
prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. 
Licensee hereby agrees that this Section 13.3 limits its rights under 
applicable Laws to commence an Action against any Persons unauthorized use 
of the Licensed IP, and hereby waives such rights, to the extent they 
conflict with this Section 13.3.

Section 13.4. Credit Cards.

(a) Licensee may not enter into any agreement with a financial institution 
or any other Person to create a co-branded credit card or any co-branded 
alternative payment technology (e.g., Google Wallet) without Licensors 
prior written consent. Should Licensee establish Separate Operations, 
Licensee may co-brand a credit card or other payment alternative provided 
such co-branding does not include any Hilton Marks and is only utilized in 
connection with the Separate Operations.

(b) Licensee shall use the then-current Loyalty Program credit card 
designated by Licensor as the exclusive instant credit card issued for down 
payments, renewals or other fees in connection with Licensed Vacation 
Ownership Properties and honor all nationally recognized credit cards and 
credit vouchers and enter into all necessary agreements with issuers 
therefor.


ARTICLE XIV

CONFIDENTIALITY

Section 14.1. Confidential Information.

(a) Absent the prior written consent of the disclosing Party (the 
Disclosing Party), each Party (the Receiving Party) shall not use any of 
the Disclosing Partys Confidential Information other than as required to 
perform this Agreement or exercise its rights hereunder, and shall not 
disclose any such Confidential Information to any Person, other than to its 
Subsidiaries (but not including Licensees Subsidiaries engaged in Separate 
Operations) and their respective employees and counsel (and Persons 
described in Section 8.3(a) who need to know it for such Party to perform 
under this Agreement (Recipients), subject to commercially reasonable 
confidentiality agreements or obligations of confidentiality (and the 
provisions of Section 14.2 for Hilton Data). Each Party shall protect the 
security of the other Partys Confidential Information with the same 
measures it uses to protect its own most sensitive information, and shall 
use at least a commercially reasonable standard of care in this regard. 
Each Party is liable for any unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential 
Information by its Recipients, and shall promptly notify the other Party 
about (and cooperate with the other Party to remediate) any instance of 
same.

(b) Confidential Information shall not include Information (other than 
Hilton Data, for which such exceptions do not apply) that: (i) was in the 
Receiving Partys possession on a non-confidential basis prior to the time 
of disclosure to such Party by or on behalf of the Disclosing Party; (ii) 
was or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of 
a disclosure by the Receiving Party or its Recipients; (iii) becomes 
available to such Party on a non-confidential basis from a source other 
than the Disclosing Party or its Recipients; (iv) was independently 
developed by the Receiving Party without the use of Confidential 
Information of the Disclosing Party; or (v) is required to be disclosed by 
applicable Laws, subpoena, legal process or document demand (or to enforce 
a Partys rights under this Agreement), provided that the Receiving Party 
shall promptly inform the Disclosing Party of any such requirement, 
disclose no more Information than as required and cooperate with any 
efforts by the Disclosing Party to obtain a protective order or similar 
treatment.

Section 14.2. Data and Data Security.

(a) As between Licensor and Licensee, (i) Licensor is the owner of all 
Hilton Data and (ii) Licensee is the owner of all Licensee Data. Unless 
otherwise specified, to the extent that any data may fall within the 
definitions of both Hilton Data and Licensee Data, the use by a Party of 
such data shall be in accordance with the rights and restrictions 
applicable to data owned by such Party, without regard to the restrictions 
applicable to the same data to the extent owned by the other Party.

(b) Subject to all terms and conditions herein, including this Section 
14.2(b), Licensor grants to Licensee during the Term a limited, 
non-transferable right to use the Hilton Data: (i) to engage in the

and analysis in furtherance of Licensees internal business purposes, in 
each case solely in connection with Licensees operation of the Licensed 
Vacation Ownership Business. Except as otherwise expressly set forth 
herein, Licensee shall not use the Hilton Data (including in aggregate 
form) for any purpose. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in 
no event shall Hilton Data (including in aggregate form) be disclosed, 
sold, assigned, leased or otherwise provided to third parties (including 
any non-Subsidiary Licensee Parties and Separate Operations) by Licensee 
except as otherwise expressly permitted herein or with Licensors prior 
written consent. Notwithstanding the above rights, Licensor is not required 
to provide any Hilton Data to Licensee to the extent such provision would 
result in Licensors violation of any applicable Laws, Privacy Policies or 
Data Security Policies.

(c) Licensees Systems and Licensees use of Hilton Data, whether acquired, 
obtained or developed prior to or after the Effective Date shall at all 
times comply with: (i) this Agreement, all applicable Laws, the Standards 
and Agreements and best practices in the industry; and (ii) Licensees own 
Privacy Policies and Data Security Policies. Licensee shall provide to 
Licensor all of its policies and procedures with respect to the Licensee 
Systems as of the Effective Date and will not materially change same 
without Licensors prior written consent. Licensee may not share or 
disclose Hilton Data to any third party vendor, or agent of Licensee 
without Licensors prior written consent. Licensee shall ensure that its 
third-party vendors that operate, host or otherwise have access to Licensee 
Systems or Hilton Data also comply with the above applicable Laws, the 
Standards and Agreements, best practices in the industry and Licensors 
Privacy Policies and Data Security Policies, and in all agreements with 
such vendors, shall expressly (i) require such compliance and (ii) 
designate Licensor as a third-party beneficiary with the right to enforce 
such agreement directly against such vendor with respect to all Hilton Data 
or Licensed IP. Other than as permitted under this Agreement, Licensee will 
not have, claim or assert any right against or to such Hilton Data.

(d) Licensee will notify Licensor immediately following discovery of any 
actual, attempted, suspected or threatened or reasonably foreseeable 
circumstance that compromises, or could reasonably be expected to 
compromise, either physical security (including security at any facility 
housing Licensee Systems or relating to transportation of Licensee Systems 
or the physical media containing Licensors Confidential Information) or 
Systems security (including security control measures of Systems of any 
variety) of any Licensee Systems used in connection with the Licensed 
Vacation Ownership Business (or Systems interacting with same) in any 
manner that either does or could reasonably be expected to permit 
unauthorized processing, use, disclosure or acquisition of or access to any 
Licensee Systems, Hilton Data, or other Confidential Information of 
Licensor, or otherwise harm the Licensed Vacation Ownership Business or the 
reputation or goodwill of Licensor (a Security Breach). Licensee shall 
remedy any such breach at its own expense, in compliance with all 
applicable Laws and the Standards and Agreements, and a remediation plan 
approved by Licensor, and the Parties shall cooperate fully in all such 
remedial actions. Unless otherwise required by applicable Laws, Licensee 
shall not make any notifications to customers, members or the general 
public of any such Security Breach without Licensors prior written 
consent.

underpayment is five (5%) or more for the period being audited, Licensee

Licensor, it shall be a Deflagging Event and Licensor may Deflag such 
Licensed Vacation Ownership Property, immediately upon notice to Licensee.

thirty (30) days, it shall be a Deflagging Event. If Licensee fails to cure 
or enter into a remediation arrangement with Licensor within sixty (60)

Ownership Property, immediately upon notice to Licensee.

Vacation Ownership Properties hereunder. Upon notice from Licensor of 
Deflagging, Licensee shall notify the Deflagged Property within 30 days, 
and starting from the date of Deflagging, Licensee will comply with the
