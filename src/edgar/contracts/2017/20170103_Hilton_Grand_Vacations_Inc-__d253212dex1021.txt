subsequent to the commencement of the period for which the Fixed Charge 
Coverage Ratio is being calculated but prior to or simultaneously with the 
event for which the calculation of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is made 
(the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Calculation Date), then the Fixed Charge 
Coverage Ratio shall be calculated giving pro forma effect to such 
incurrence, assumption, guarantee, redemption, repayment, retirement or 
extinguishment of Indebtedness, or such issuance or redemption of 
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, as if the same had occurred at the 
beginning of the applicable four-quarter period; provided, however, that

calculated giving pro forma effect thereto for such period as if such 
Investment, acquisition, disposition, merger, amalgamation, consolidation 
or discontinued operation had occurred at the beginning of the applicable 
four-quarter period.

For purposes of this definition, whenever pro forma effect is to be given

interest and is being given pro forma effect, the interest on such 
Indebtedness shall be calculated as if the rate in effect on the Fixed 
Charge Coverage Ratio Calculation Date had been the applicable rate for the 
entire period (taking into account any Hedging Obligations applicable to 
such Indebtedness). Interest on a Capitalized Lease Obligation shall be 
deemed to accrue at an interest rate reasonably determined by a responsible 
financial or accounting officer of the Issuer to be the rate of interest 
implicit in such Capitalized Lease Obligation in accordance with GAAP. For 
purposes of making the computation referred to above, interest on any 
Indebtedness under a revolving credit facility computed on a pro forma 
basis shall be computed based upon the average daily balance of such 
Indebtedness during the applicable period except as set forth in the first 
paragraph of this definition. Interest on Indebtedness that may optionally 
be determined at an interest rate based upon a factor of a prime or similar 
rate, a eurocurrency interbank offered rate, or other rate, shall be deemed 
to have been based upon the rate actually chosen, or, if none, then based 
upon such optional rate chosen as the Issuer may designate.

substantially similar tenor signed by such Holders in person or by an agent

any action taken, suffered or omitted by the Trustee or the Issuers in 
reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such action is made upon such 
Note.

(e) The Issuers may, in the circumstances permitted by the Trust Indenture

by vote or consent authorized or permitted to be given or taken by Holders. 
Unless otherwise specified, if not set by the Issuers prior to the first

or in the case of any such vote, prior to such vote, any such record date 
shall be the later of 10 days prior to the first solicitation of such 
consent or, if the Trustee is not then also the Registrar, the date of the

part.

(g) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, a Holder, including

by a proxy or proxies duly appointed in writing, any request, demand, 
authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided 
in this Indenture to be made, given or taken by Holders. If such a record 
date is fixed, the Holders on such record date or their duly appointed 
proxy or proxies, and only such Persons, shall be entitled to make, give or 
take such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, 
waiver or other action, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after 
such record date. No such request, demand, authorization, direction, 
notice, consent, waiver or other action shall be valid or effective if 
made, given or taken more than 120 days after such record date.

same force and effect as if made on such scheduled date and (provided such 
payment is made on such succeeding Business Day) no interest shall accrue 
on the amount of such payment from and after such scheduled date to the 
time of such payment on such next succeeding Business Day and the amount of 
any such payment that is an interest payment will reflect accrual only

co-issuer shall be jointly and severally liable for all obligations of the 
Issuer under or related to, or arising in connection with, this Indenture 
and the Notes, and any document to be executed by the Issuer hereunder 
during such time shall be executed by each such issuer and co-issuer.

Section 1.08. Financial Calculations for Limited Condition Acquisitions. 
For purposes of calculating the availability under any basket or ratio 
under this Indenture, in each case in connection with a Limited Condition 
Acquisition, the date of determination of any such basket or ratio under 
this Indenture and of any Default or Event of Default related thereto may, 
at the option of the Issuers, be the date the definitive agreements for 
such Limited Condition Acquisition are entered into, in which case such 
baskets or ratios shall be calculated with such pro forma adjustments as 
are appropriate and consistent with the pro forma adjustment provisions set 
forth in the definition of Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio in Section 1.01 
hereof after giving effect to such Limited Condition Acquisition and the 
other transactions to be entered into in connection therewith (including 
any incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) as if they 
occurred at the beginning of the applicable period for purposes of 
determining the ability to consummate any such Limited Condition 
Acquisition (and not for purposes of any subsequent availability of any 
basket or ratio). For the avoidance of doubt, (a) if any of such baskets or 
ratios are exceeded as a result of fluctuations in such basket or ratio 
(including due to fluctuations in EBITDA of the Issuers or the target 
company) subsequent to such date of determination and at or prior to the 
consummation of the relevant Limited Condition Acquisition, such baskets or 
ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded as a result of such 
fluctuations for purposes of determining whether the Limited Condition 
Acquisition and related transactions are permitted under this Indenture and 
(b) such baskets or ratios shall not be tested at the time of consummation 
of such Limited Condition Acquisition or related transactions solely for 
purposes of determining whether such Limited Condition Acquisition is 
permitted under this Indenture; provided, however, that if the Issuers 
elect to have such determinations occur at the time of entry into such 
definitive agreement, any such transactions (including any incurrence of 
Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) shall be deemed to have 
occurred on the date such definitive agreement is entered and shall be 
deemed to be outstanding thereafter for purposes of calculating any usage 
of baskets or ratios under this Indenture from and including the date of 
such definitive agreement and before the consummation of such Limited 
Condition Acquisition, unless and until such Limited Condition Acquisition 
has been abandoned or such definitive agreement has expired or been 
terminated prior to consummation thereof.

of any beneficial owners thereof who acquired an interest therein during 
the Restricted Period pursuant to another exemption from registration under 
the Securities Act and who shall take delivery of a beneficial ownership 
interest in a 144A Global Note bearing the Private Placement Legend, all as 
contemplated by Section 2.06(b) hereof) and (B) an Officers Certificate 
from the Issuers, the Trustee shall remove the Regulation S Temporary 
Global Note Legend from the Regulation S Temporary Global Note, following 
which temporary beneficial interests in the Regulation S Temporary Global 
Note shall automatically become beneficial interests in the Regulation S 
Permanent Global Note pursuant to the Applicable Procedures.

The aggregate principal amount of a Regulation S Temporary Global Note and 
a Regulation S Permanent Global Note may from time to time be increased or 
decreased by adjustments made on the records of the Trustee and the 
Depositary or its nominee, as the case may be, in connection with transfers 
of interest as hereinafter provided.

(d) Terms. The aggregate principal amount of Notes that may be 
authenticated and delivered under this Indenture is unlimited.

The terms and provisions contained in the Notes shall constitute, and are 
hereby expressly made, a part of this Indenture and the Issuers, the 
Guarantors from time to time party hereto and the Trustee, by their 
execution and delivery of this Indenture, expressly agree to such terms and 
provisions and to be bound thereby. However, to the extent any provision of 
any Note conflicts with the express provisions of this Indenture, the 
provisions of this Indenture shall govern and be controlling.

The Notes shall be subject to repurchase by the Issuers pursuant to an 
Asset Sale Offer as provided in Section 4.10 hereof or a Change of Control 
Offer as provided in Section 4.14 hereof. The Notes shall not be

redemption or otherwise as the Initial Notes, except that interest may 
accrue on the Additional Notes from their date of issuance (or such other 
date specified by the Issuers); provided that if any Additional Notes are 
not fungible with the Initial Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes, 
such Additional Notes will have a separate CUSIP number. Any Additional 
Notes may be issued with the benefit of an indenture supplemental to this 
Indenture.

(e) Euroclear and Clearstream Applicable Procedures. The provisions of the 
Operating Procedures of the Euroclear System and Terms and Conditions 
Governing Use of Euroclear and the General Terms and Conditions of 
Clearstream Banking and Customer Handbook of Clearstream shall be 
applicable to transfers of beneficial interests in the Regulation S 
Temporary Global Note and the Regulation S Permanent Global Notes that are 
held by Participants through Euroclear or Clearstream.

Section 2.02. Execution and Authentication. At least one Officer of each of 
the Issuer and the Co-Issuer shall execute the Notes on behalf of the 
Issuer and the Co-Issuer, as applicable, by manual, facsimile or electronic 
(including .pdf) signature.

If an Officer of the Issuer or the Co-Issuer whose signature is on a Note 
no longer holds that office at the time the Trustee authenticates the Note, 
the Note shall nevertheless be valid.

A Note shall not be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture or be 
valid or obligatory for any purpose until authenticated substantially in 
the form of Exhibit A-1 hereto, in the case of the PHRI Notes, or in the 
form of Exhibit A-2 hereto, in the case of any other Notes, by the manual 
signature of the Trustee. The signature shall be conclusive evidence that 
the Note has been duly authenticated and delivered under this Indenture.

On the Issue Date, the Trustee shall, upon receipt of an Issuers Order (an 
Authentication Order), authenticate and deliver the Initial Notes in the 
aggregate principal amount or amounts specified in such Authentication 
Order. In addition, at any time, from time to time, the Trustee shall, upon 
receipt of an Authentication Order, authenticate and deliver any Additional 
Notes or Exchange Notes for an aggregate principal amount specified in such 
Authentication Order for such Additional Notes or Exchange Notes issued or 
increased hereunder.

The Trustee may appoint an authenticating agent acceptable to the Issuers 
to authenticate Notes. An authenticating agent may authenticate Notes 
whenever the Trustee may do so. Each reference in this Indenture to 
authentication by the Trustee includes authentication by such agent. An 
authenticating agent has the same rights as an Agent to deal with Holders 
or an Affiliate of the Issuers.

Section 2.03. Registrar, Transfer Agent and Paying Agent. The Issuers shall 
maintain (i) an office or agency where Notes may be presented for 
registration (the Registrar), which shall be Wilmington Trust, National 
Association as of the date of this Indenture, (ii) an office or agency 
where the Notes may be presented for transfer or for exchange (the 
Transfer Agent), which shall be Wilmington Trust, National Association as 
of the date of this Indenture and (iii) an office or agency where Notes may 
be presented for payment (the Paying Agent), which shall be Wilmington 
Trust, National Association as of the date of this Indenture. The Registrar 
shall keep a register of the Notes (Note Register) and of their transfer 
and exchange. The registered Holder of a Note will be treated as the owner 
of such Note for all purposes and only registered Holders shall have rights 
under this Indenture and the Notes. The Issuers may appoint one or more 
co-registrars, one or more co-transfer agents and one or more additional 
paying agents. The term Registrar includes any co-registrar, the term 
Transfer Agent includes any co-transfer agent and the term Paying Agent 
includes any additional paying agents. The Issuers may change any Paying 
Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar without prior notice to any Holder. The 
Issuers shall notify the Trustee in writing of the name and address of any 
Agent not a party to this Indenture. If the Issuers fail to appoint or 
maintain another entity as Registrar, Transfer Agent or Paying Agent, the 
Trustee shall act as such. Either Issuer or any of its respective 
Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar upon 
written notice to the Trustee.

The Issuers initially appoint The Depository Trust Company, its nominees 
and successors (DTC) to act as Depositary with respect to any Global 
Notes.
 
-44-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Issuers initially appoint the Trustee to act as the Paying Agent, 
Transfer Agent and Registrar for the Notes and to act as Custodian with 
respect to the Notes and any Global Notes.

If any Notes are listed on an exchange and the rules of such exchange so 
require, the Issuers will satisfy any requirement of such exchange as to 
paying agents, registrars and transfer agents and will comply with any 
notice requirements required under such exchange in connection with any 
change of paying agent, registrar or transfer agent.

Section 2.04. Paying Agent to Hold Money in Trust. The Issuers shall 
require each Paying Agent other than the Trustee to agree in writing that 
the Paying Agent shall hold in trust for the benefit of Holders or the 
Trustee all money held by the Paying Agent for the payment of principal, 
premium, if any, interest or Additional Interest, if any, on the Notes, and 
will notify the Trustee in writing of any default by the Issuers in making 
any such payment. While any such default continues, the Trustee may require 
a Paying Agent (other than the Trustee) to pay all money held by it to the 
Trustee. The Issuers at any time may require a Paying Agent (other than the 
Trustee) to pay all money held by it to the Trustee. Upon payment over to 
the Trustee, the Paying Agent (if other than the Issuer or a Subsidiary or 
the Trustee) shall have no further liability for the money. If the Issuer 
or a Subsidiary acts as Paying Agent, it shall segregate and hold in a 
separate trust fund for the benefit of the Holders all money held by it as 
Paying Agent. Upon any bankruptcy or reorganization proceedings relating to 
the Issuer or the Co-Issuer, the Trustee shall serve as Paying Agent for 
the Notes.

Section 2.05. Holder Lists. The Trustee shall preserve in as current a form 
as is reasonably practicable the most recent list available to it of the 
names and addresses of all Holders and shall otherwise comply with Section

Issuers shall furnish to the Trustee at least two Business Days before each 
Interest Payment Date (other than the Initial Interest Payment Date) and at 
such other times as the Trustee may request in writing, a list in such form 
and as of such date as the Trustee may reasonably require of the names and 
addresses of the Holders and the Issuers shall otherwise comply with 
Section 312(a) of the Trust Indenture Act.

within 120 days, (ii) the Issuers, at their option, notify the Trustee in 
writing that they elect to cause the issuance of Definitive Notes (although 
Regulation S Temporary Global Notes may not be exchanged for Definitive

of the Depositary (in accordance with its customary procedures). Global 
Notes also may be exchanged or replaced, in whole or in part, as provided 
in Sections 2.07 and 2.10 hereof. Every Note authenticated and delivered in 
exchange for, or in lieu of, a Global Note or any portion thereof, pursuant 
to this Section 2.06 or Sections 2.07 or 2.10 hereof, shall be

except for Definitive Notes issued subsequent to any of the events 
described in clause (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) above and pursuant to Section 
2.06(c) hereof. A Global Note may not be exchanged for another Note other

obligations of the Issuers, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the 
same benefits under this Indenture, as the Global Notes or Definitive Notes 
surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.

(vi) Prior to due presentment for the registration of a transfer of any 
Note, the Trustee, any Agent and the Issuers shall deem and treat the 
Person in whose name any Note is registered as the absolute owner of such 
Note for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of (and premium, if

a Note, the Trustee shall be under a duty to receive and examine the same 
to determine whether on its face it conforms to the express terms of this 
Indenture and shall promptly notify the party delivering the same if such 
certificate does not comply with such terms.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Section 2.07. Replacement Notes. If either (x) any mutilated Note is 
surrendered to the Trustee, the Registrar or the Issuers, or (y) the 
Issuers and the Trustee receive evidence to their satisfaction of the 
ownership and destruction, loss or theft of any Note, then the Issuers 
shall issue and the Trustee, upon receipt of an Authentication Order and 
satisfaction of any other requirements of the Trustee, shall authenticate a 
replacement Note. If required by the Trustee or the Issuers, an indemnity 
bond must be supplied by the Holder that is sufficient in the judgment of 
both (i) the Trustee to protect the Trustee and (ii) the Issuers to protect 
the Issuers, the Trustee, any Agent and any authenticating agent from any 
loss that any of them may suffer if a Note is replaced. The Issuers and the 
Trustee may charge the Holder for their expenses in replacing a Note.

Every replacement Note is a contractual obligation of the Issuers and shall 
be entitled to all of the benefits of this Indenture equally and 
proportionately with all other Notes duly issued hereunder.

Section 2.08. Outstanding Notes. The Notes outstanding at any time are all 
the Notes authenticated by the Trustee except for those cancelled by it, 
those delivered to it for cancellation, those reductions in the interest in 
a Global Note effected by the Trustee in accordance with the provisions 
hereof and those described in this Section 2.08 as not outstanding. Except 
as set forth in Section 2.09 hereof, a Note does not cease to be 
outstanding because the Issuer, the Co-Issuer or a Guarantor or an 
Affiliate of the Issuer, the Co-Issuer or a Guarantor holds the Note.

If a Note is replaced pursuant to Section 2.07 hereof, it ceases to be 
outstanding unless the Trustee receives proof satisfactory to it that the 
replaced Note is held by a protected purchaser (as defined in Section 8-303 
of the Uniform Commercial Code).

Notes in exchange for or in lieu of which other Notes have been 
authenticated and delivered pursuant to this Indenture shall not be deemed 
to be outstanding for purposes hereof.

If the principal amount of any Note is considered paid under Section 4.01 
hereof, such Note shall cease to be outstanding and interest thereon shall 
cease to accrue.

If the Paying Agent (other than the Issuer, the Co-Issuer or a Guarantor or 
an Affiliate of the Issuer, the Co-Issuer or a Guarantor) holds, on a 
Redemption Date or maturity date, money sufficient to pay Notes (or 
portions thereof) payable on that date, then on and after that date such 
Notes (or portions thereof) shall be deemed to be no longer outstanding 
(including for accounting purposes) and shall cease to accrue interest on 
and after such date.

Section 2.09. Treasury Notes. In determining whether the Holders of the 
required principal amount of Notes have concurred in any direction, waiver 
or consent at any time from and including the Reset Date, Notes owned by 
the Issuer, the Co-Issuer or by any Affiliate of the Issuer or the 
Co-Issuer, shall be considered as though not outstanding, except that for 
the purposes of determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in 
relying on any such direction, waiver or consent, only Notes that a 
Responsible Officer of the Trustee actually knows are so owned shall be so 
disregarded. Notes so owned which have been pledged in good faith shall not 
be disregarded if the pledgee establishes to the satisfaction of the 
Trustee the pledgees right to deliver any such direction, waiver or 
consent with respect to such pledged Notes and that the pledgee is not the 
Issuer, the Co-Issuer or a Guarantor or any Affiliate of the Issuer, the 
Co-Issuer or a Guarantor.
 
-56-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Section 2.10. Temporary Notes. Until certificates representing Notes are 
ready for delivery, the Issuers may prepare and the Trustee, upon receipt 
of an Authentication Order, shall authenticate temporary Notes. Temporary 
Notes shall be substantially in the form of certificated Notes but may have 
variations that the Issuers consider appropriate for temporary Notes. 
Without unreasonable delay, the Issuers shall prepare and the Trustee shall 
authenticate definitive Notes in exchange for temporary Notes.

Holders and beneficial holders, as the case may be, of temporary Notes 
shall be entitled to all of the benefits accorded to Holders, or beneficial 
holders, respectively, of Notes under this Indenture.

Section 2.11. Cancellation. The Issuers at any time may deliver Notes to 
the Trustee for cancellation. The Registrar and Paying Agent shall forward 
to the Trustee any Notes surrendered to them for registration of transfer, 
exchange or payment. The Trustee or, at the direction of the Trustee, the 
Registrar or the Paying Agent and no one else shall cancel all Notes 
surrendered for registration of transfer, exchange, payment, replacement or 
cancellation and shall dispose of such cancelled Notes in its customary 
manner (subject to the record retention requirements of the Exchange Act). 
Certification of the cancellation of all cancelled Notes shall be delivered 
to the Issuers upon their written request therefor. The Issuers may not 
issue new Notes to replace Notes that they have paid or that have been 
delivered to the Trustee for cancellation.

Section 2.12. Defaulted Interest. If the Issuers default in a payment of 
interest on the Notes, they shall pay the defaulted interest in any lawful 
manner plus, to the extent lawful, interest payable on the defaulted 
interest to the Persons who are Holders on a subsequent special record 
date, in each case at the rate provided in the Notes and in Section 4.01 
hereof. The Issuers shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of 
defaulted interest proposed to be paid on each Note and the date of the 
proposed payment, and at the same time the Issuers shall deposit with the 
Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be 
paid in respect of such defaulted interest or shall make arrangements 
satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit prior to the date of the 
proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the 
benefit of the Persons entitled to such defaulted interest as provided in 
this Section 2.12. The Issuers shall fix or cause to be fixed any such 
special record date and payment date; provided that no such special record 
date shall be less than 10 days prior to the related payment date for such 
defaulted interest. The Issuers shall promptly notify the Trustee of any 
such special record date. At least 15 days before any such special record 
date, the Issuers (or, upon the written request of the Issuers, the Trustee 
in the name and at the expense of the Issuers) shall mail or cause to be 
mailed, first-class postage prepaid, or otherwise deliver in accordance 
with the Applicable Procedures, to each Holder, with a copy to the Trustee, 
a notice at his or her address as it appears in the Note Register that 
states the special record date, the related payment date and the amount of 
such interest to be paid.

Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.12 and for greater 
certainty, each Note delivered under this Indenture upon registration of 
transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Note shall carry the 
rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by 
such other Note.

Section 2.13. CUSIP Numbers; ISINs. The Issuers in issuing the Notes may 
use CUSIP numbers and ISINs (in each case, if then generally in use) and, 
if so, the Trustee shall use CUSIP numbers and ISINs in notices of 
redemption or exchange as a convenience to Holders; provided that any such 
notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of 
such numbers either as printed on the Notes or as contained in any notice 
of redemption or exchange and that reliance may be placed only on the other 
identification numbers printed on the Notes, and any such redemption shall 
not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Issuers 
will as promptly as practicable notify the Trustee in writing of any change 
in the CUSIP numbers and ISINs.

listing is known to the Trustee), in compliance with the requirements of 
such exchange on which such Notes are listed or (b) on a pro rata basis to 
the extent practicable, or, if the pro rata basis is not practicable for 
any reason, by lot or by such other method as the Trustee shall deem fair 
and appropriate and otherwise in accordance with the Applicable Procedures 
in minimum denominations of $2,000 and increments of $1,000 in excess 
thereof. In the event of partial redemption by lot, the particular Notes to 
be redeemed shall be selected, unless otherwise provided herein, not less

from the outstanding Notes not previously called for redemption.

minimum amount of $2,000) and no Notes of $2,000 or less can be redeemed in 
part, except that if all of the Notes of a Holder are to be redeemed, the 
entire outstanding amount of Notes held by such Holder shall be redeemed, 
even if not in a principal amount of at least $2,000. Except as provided in 
the preceding sentence, provisions of this Indenture that apply to Notes 
called for redemption also apply to portions of Notes called for 
redemption.

Section 3.03. Notice of Redemption. Subject to Section 3.08 hereof, the 
Issuers shall send electronically, mail or cause to be mailed by 
first-class mail, postage prepaid, notices of redemption at least 15 days 
but (except as set forth in Section 3.07(e)) not more than 60 days before 
the Redemption Date to each Holder of Notes to be redeemed at such Holders 
registered address stated in the Note Register or otherwise in accordance 
with the Applicable Procedures, except that redemption notices may be 
delivered or mailed more than 60 days prior to a Redemption Date if the 
notice is issued in connection with Article 8 or Article 11 hereof. Notices 
of redemption may, at the Issuers discretion, be conditional.

The notice shall identify the Notes to be redeemed and shall state:

(a) the Redemption Date;

(b) the redemption price;

(c) if any Definitive Note is to be redeemed in part only, the portion of 
the principal amount of that Note that is to be redeemed and that, after 
the Redemption Date upon surrender of such Note, a new Note or Notes in a 
principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the original Note 
representing the same indebtedness to the extent not redeemed will be 
issued in the name of the Holder upon cancellation of the original Note; 
provided that new Notes will only be issued in minimum denominations of 
$2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess of $2,000;

(d) the name and address of the Paying Agent;

(e) that Notes called for redemption must be surrendered to the Paying 
Agent to collect the redemption price;

(f) that, unless the Issuers default in making such redemption payment, 
interest on Notes called for redemption ceases to accrue on and after the 
Redemption Date;

(g) the paragraph or subparagraph of the Notes and/or Section of this 
Indenture pursuant to which the Notes called for redemption are being 
redeemed;
 
-58-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(h) the CUSIP number and ISIN, if any, printed on the Notes being redeemed 
and that no representation is made as to the correctness or accuracy of any 
such CUSIP number and ISIN that is listed in such notice or printed on the 
Notes; and

(i) any condition to such redemption.

In addition, any notice of redemption may include additional information, 
including any information pursuant to Section 3.07(e) hereof.

At the Issuers request, the Trustee shall give the notice of redemption in 
the Issuers name and at their expense; provided that the Issuers shall 
have delivered to the Trustee, at least two Business Days before notice of 
redemption is required to be delivered electronically, mailed or caused to 
be mailed to Holders pursuant to this Section 3.03 (unless a shorter notice 
shall be agreed to by the Trustee), an Officers Certificate requesting 
that the Trustee give such notice and setting forth the information to be 
stated in such notice as provided in the preceding paragraph.

If the Notes are listed on an exchange, for so long as the Notes are so 
listed and the rules of such exchange so require, the Issuers shall notify 
the exchange of any such redemption and, if applicable, of the principal 
amount of any Notes outstanding following any partial redemption of Notes.

Section 3.04. Effect of Notice of Redemption. A notice of redemption, if 
delivered electronically, mailed or caused to be mailed in a manner herein 
provided, shall be conclusively presumed to have been given, whether or not 
the Holder receives such notice. In any case, failure to deliver such 
notice or any defect in the notice to the Holder of any Note designated for 
redemption in whole or in part shall not affect the validity of the 
proceedings for the redemption of any other Note. Notes or portions of 
Notes called for redemption shall become due and payable on the Redemption 
Date, subject to satisfaction of any conditions specified in the notice. 
Subject to Section 3.05 hereof, on and after the Redemption Date, interest 
shall cease to accrue on Notes or portions of Notes called for redemption.

Section 3.05. Deposit of Redemption Price.

(a) Prior to 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the Redemption Date, the 
Issuers shall deposit with the Trustee or with the Paying Agent money 
sufficient to pay the redemption price of and accrued and unpaid interest 
on all Notes to be redeemed on that Redemption Date. The Trustee or the 
Paying Agent shall promptly return to the Issuers any money deposited with 
the Trustee or the Paying Agent by the Issuers in excess of the amounts 
necessary to pay the redemption price of, and accrued and unpaid interest 
on, all Notes to be redeemed.

(b) If the Issuers comply with the provisions of the preceding paragraph 
(a), on and after the Redemption Date, interest shall cease to accrue on 
the Notes or the portions of Notes called for redemption. If a Note is 
redeemed on or after an applicable Record Date but on or prior to the 
related Interest Payment Date, then any accrued and unpaid interest to the 
Redemption Date shall be paid to the Person in whose name such Note was 
registered at the close of business on such Record Date. If any Note called 
for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender for redemption because 
of the failure of the Issuers to comply with the preceding paragraph, 
interest shall be paid on the unpaid principal, from the Redemption Date 
until such principal is paid, and to the extent lawful on any interest 
accrued to the Redemption Date not paid on such unpaid principal, in each 
case at the rate provided in the Notes and in Section 4.01 hereof.

Section 3.06. Notes Redeemed in Part. Upon surrender of a Definitive Note 
that is redeemed in part, the Issuers shall issue and the Trustee shall 
authenticate for the Holder, at the expense of the Issuers, a new Note 
equal in principal amount to the unredeemed portion of the Note surrendered 
representing the same indebtedness to the extent not redeemed; provided 
that each new Note will be in a minimum principal amount of $2,000 and any 
integral multiple of $1,000 in excess of $2,000. It is understood that, 
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Indenture, only an 
Authentication Order and not an Opinion of Counsel or Officers Certificate 
is required for the Trustee to authenticate such new Note.

Section 3.07. Optional Redemption.

(a) Except as set forth in clauses (b) and (d) of this Section 3.07, the 
Notes will not be redeemable at the Issuers option prior to December 1, 
2021.

(b) At any time prior to December 1, 2021, the Issuers may, at their 
option, and on one or more occasions, redeem all or a part of the Notes, 
upon notice in accordance with Section 3.03 hereof, at a redemption price 
equal to the sum of (A) 100.0% of the principal amount of the Notes 
redeemed, plus (B) the Applicable Premium as of the Redemption Date, plus 
(C) accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Interest, if any, to, but 
excluding, the Redemption Date, subject to the right of Holders of record 
on the relevant Record Date to receive interest due on the relevant 
Interest Payment Date falling prior to or on the Redemption Date.

(c) On and after December 1, 2021, the Issuers may, at their option and on 
one or more occasions, redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, upon notice 
in accordance with Section 3.03 hereof, at the redemption prices (expressed 
as percentages of principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed) set forth 
below, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Interest, if any, 
thereon to, but excluding, the applicable Redemption Date, subject to the 
right of Holders of record on the relevant Record Date to receive interest 
due on the relevant Interest Payment Date falling prior to or on the 
Redemption Date, if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on 
December 1 of each of the years indicated below:
 
Year 	   	Percentage 	 
 2021
   	  	103.250 	% 
 2022
   	  	101.625 	% 
 2023 and thereafter
   	  	100.000 	% 

(d) In connection with any tender offer for the Notes, including without 
limitation any Change of Control Offer, if Holders of not less than 90% in 
aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do 
not withdraw such Notes in such tender offer and the Issuers, or any third 
party making such tender offer in lieu of the Issuers, purchase all of the 
Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuers or 
such third party will have the right upon not less than 15 nor more than 60 
days prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such purchase 
date, to redeem all Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase 
at a price equal to the price offered to each other Holder in such tender 
offer plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer payment, accrued 
and unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to, but excluding, the Redemption 
Date.

(e) Any redemption pursuant to this Section 3.07 shall be made pursuant to 
the provisions of Sections 3.01 through 3.06 hereof. Notice of any 
redemption may be given prior to the completion thereof, and any such 
redemption or notice may, at the Issuers discretion, be subject to one or 
more conditions precedent, including, but not limited to, completion of the 
related transaction. In addition, if such redemption is subject to 
satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice shall state 
that, in the Issuers discretion, the Redemption Date may be delayed until 
such time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied, or such 
redemption may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that 
any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied by the Redemption 
Date, or by the Redemption Date so delayed. For the avoidance of doubt, if 
any Redemption Date shall be delayed pursuant to this Section 3.07(e) and 
the terms of the applicable notice of redemption, such Redemption Date as 
so delayed may occur at any time after the original Redemption Date set 
forth in the applicable notice of redemption and after the satisfaction of 
any applicable conditions precedent, including, without limitation, on a 
date that is more than 60 days after the date of the applicable notice of 
redemption. In addition, the Issuers may provide in such notice that 
payment of the redemption price and performance of the Issuers obligations 
with respect to such redemption may be performed by another Person. The 
Issuers, the Investors and their respective Affiliates may acquire the 
Notes by means other than a redemption pursuant to this Section 3.07, 
whether by tender offer, open market purchases, negotiated transactions or 
otherwise.

(f) The Trustee shall have no duty to calculate or verify the calculation 
of the Applicable Premium.

Section 3.08. Offers to Repurchase by Application of Excess Proceeds.

(a) In the event that, pursuant to Section 4.10 hereof, the Issuers shall 
be required to commence an Asset Sale Offer, the Issuers shall follow the 
procedures specified below.

(b) The Asset Sale Offer shall remain open for a period of 20 Business Days 
following its commencement and no longer, except to the extent that a 
longer period is required by applicable law (the Offer Period). No later 
than five Business Days after the termination of the Offer Period (the 
Purchase Date), the Issuers shall apply all Excess Proceeds (the Offer 
Amount) to the purchase of Notes and, if required, Pari Passu Indebtedness 
(on a pro rata basis, if applicable, with adjustments as necessary so that 
no Notes or Pari Passu Indebtedness will be repurchased in part in an 
unauthorized denomination), or, if less than the Offer Amount has been 
tendered, all Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered in response to the 
Asset Sale Offer. Payment for any Notes so purchased shall be made in the 
same manner as interest payments are made.

related Interest Payment Date, any accrued and unpaid interest and 
Additional Interest, if any, up to but excluding the Purchase Date, shall 
be paid to the Person in whose name a Note is registered at the close of 
business on such Record Date, and no additional interest shall be payable 
to Holders who tender Notes pursuant to the Asset Sale Offer.

(d) Upon the commencement of an Asset Sale Offer, the Issuers shall send 
electronically or by first-class mail, a notice to each of the Holders, 
with a copy to the Trustee. The notice shall contain all instructions and 
materials necessary to enable such Holders to tender Notes pursuant to the 
Asset Sale Offer. The Asset Sale Offer shall be made to all Holders and 
holders of such Pari Passu Indebtedness. The notice, which shall govern the 
terms of the Asset Sale Offer, shall state:

(i) that the Asset Sale Offer is being made pursuant to this Section 3.08 
and Section 4.10 hereof and the length of time the Asset Sale Offer shall 
remain open;

transfer such Note by book-entry transfer, to the Issuers, the Depositary, 
if appointed by the Issuers, or a Paying Agent at the address specified in 
the notice at least two Business Days before the Purchase Date;

(vii) that Holders shall be entitled to withdraw their election if the 
Issuers, the Depositary or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, receives, 
not later than the close of business on the second Business Day prior to 
the expiration date of the Offer Period, a facsimile transmission or letter 
setting forth the name of the Holder, the principal amount of the Note the 
Holder delivered for purchase and a statement that such Holder is 
withdrawing his election to have such Note purchased;

(viii) that, if the aggregate principal amount of Notes or the Pari Passu 
Indebtedness, as the case may be, surrendered by the holders thereof 
exceeds the Offer Amount, the Issuers shall purchase such Notes and such 
Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, on a pro rata basis based on 
the accreted value or principal amount of the Notes or such Pari Passu 
Indebtedness, as the case may be, tendered (with such adjustments as may be 
deemed appropriate by the Issuers so that only Notes in an amount not less 
than $2,000 or integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof are 
purchased); and

(ix) that Holders whose certificated Notes were purchased only in part 
shall be issued new Notes equal in principal amount to the unpurchased 
portion of the Notes surrendered (or transferred by book-entry transfer) 
representing the same indebtedness to the extent not repurchased; provided 
that new Notes will only be issued in denominations of $2,000 and integral 
multiples of $1,000 in excess of $2,000.

a new Note, and the Trustee, upon receipt of an Authentication Order, shall 
authenticate and mail or deliver (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) 
such new Note to such Holder (it being understood that, notwithstanding

Officers Certificate is required for the Trustee to authenticate and mail 
or deliver such new Note) in a principal amount equal to any unpurchased 
portion of the Note surrendered representing the same indebtedness to the 
extent not repurchased; provided, that each such new Note shall be in a 
principal amount of $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess 
thereof. Any Note not so accepted shall be promptly mailed or delivered by 
the Issuers to the Holder thereof. The Issuers shall publicly announce the 
results of the Asset Sale Offer on or as soon as practicable after the

requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act or otherwise report 
on an annual and quarterly basis on forms provided for such annual and

SEC, the Issuer shall file with the SEC (with a copy to the Trustee unless

ending after the Reset Date), annual reports on Form 10-K, or any successor 
or comparable form (if the Issuer had been a reporting company under

information that would be required to be contained therein, or required in 
such successor or comparable form;

the Offering Memorandum); provided, however, that the Issuer shall not be 
so obligated to file such reports referred to in clauses (i), (ii) and 
(iii) above with the SEC if the SEC does not permit such filing, in which 
event the Issuer shall make available such information to the Trustee, the 
Holders and prospective purchasers of Notes, in each case within 15 days 
after the time the Issuer would be required to file such information with 
the SEC if it were subject to Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act. In 
addition, to the extent not satisfied by the foregoing, for so long as any

Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations presenting (in a 
manner consistent with the presentation of information included or 
incorporated by reference in the Offering Memorandum) selected financial 
measures of such Unrestricted Subsidiaries in the aggregate (separate from

To the extent any information is not provided within the time periods 
specified in this Section 4.03 and such information is subsequently 
provided, the Issuer will be deemed to have satisfied its obligations with 
respect thereto at such time and any Default with respect thereto shall be 
deemed to have been cured.

(a) The Issuer shall deliver to the Trustee, within 90 days after the end 
of each fiscal year ending after the Issue Date (or 120 days for the first 
fiscal year ending after the Issue Date), a certificate from its principal 
executive officer, principal financial officer or principal accounting 
officer stating that a review of the activities of the Issuer and its 
Restricted Subsidiaries during the preceding fiscal year has been made 
under the supervision of the signing Officer with a view to determining 
whether the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries have kept, observed, 
performed and fulfilled their respective obligations under this Indenture, 
and further stating, as to such Officer signing such certificate, that to 
the best of his or her knowledge, on behalf of the Issuer and its 
Restricted Subsidiaries have kept, observed, performed and fulfilled in all 
material respects each and every condition and covenant contained in this 
Indenture during such fiscal year and no Default has occurred and is 
continuing with respect to any of the terms, provisions, covenants and 
conditions of this Indenture (or, if a Default shall have occurred and is 
continuing, describing all such Defaults of which he or she may have 
knowledge and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take with 
respect thereto).

(b) When any Default has occurred and is continuing under this Indenture, 
or if the Trustee or the holder of any other evidence of Indebtedness of 
the Issuer or any Subsidiary gives any notice or takes any other action 
with respect to a claimed Default, the Issuer shall promptly (which shall 
be no more than 20 Business Days after becoming aware of such Default) 
deliver to the Trustee by registered or certified mail or by facsimile 
transmission an Officers Certificate specifying such event and what action 
the Issuer proposes to take with respect thereto.

Section 4.05. Taxes. The Issuer shall pay or discharge, and shall cause 
each of its Restricted Subsidiaries to pay or discharge, prior to 
delinquency, all material taxes, lawful assessments, and governmental 
levies except such as are contested in good faith and by appropriate 
actions or where the failure to effect such payment or discharge is not 
adverse in any material respect to the Holders.

Section 4.06. Stay, Extension and Usury Laws. The Issuer, the Co-Issuer and 
each of the Guarantors covenant (to the extent that they may lawfully do 
so) that they shall not at any time insist upon, plead, or in any manner 
whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay, extension 
or usury law wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, that 
may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture and the 
Notes; and the Issuer, the Co-Issuer and each of the Guarantors (to the 
extent that they may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waive all benefit or 
advantage of any such law, and (to the extent that they may lawfully do so) 
covenant that they shall not, by resort to any such law, hinder, delay or 
impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but shall 
suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law 
has been enacted.

Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly:

(i) declare or pay any dividend or make any payment or distribution on 
account of the Issuers or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries Equity 
Interests (in each case, solely to a holder of Equity Interests in such 
Persons capacity as a holder of such Equity Interests), including any 
dividend, payment or distribution payable in connection with any merger, 
amalgamation or consolidation, other than:

the case of any dividend, payment or distribution payable on or in respect 
of any class or series of securities issued by a Restricted Subsidiary

receives at least its pro rata share of such dividend, payment or 
distribution in accordance with its Equity Interests in such class or 
series of securities;

Stock or any other event which results in any such Restricted Subsidiary 
ceasing to be a Restricted Subsidiary or any other subsequent transfer of 
any such Indebtedness (except to the Issuer or another Restricted 
Subsidiary or any pledge of such Indebtedness constituting a Permitted

(ii) the Issuer shall be entitled to divide and classify an item of

Preferred Stock for purposes of this Section 4.09. Any Refinancing 
Indebtedness and any Indebtedness permitted to be incurred under this 
Indenture to refinance Indebtedness incurred pursuant to clauses (i) and

For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated 
restriction on the incurrence of Indebtedness, the U.S. Dollar Equivalent 
principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency shall be 
calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the 
date such Indebtedness was incurred, in the case of term debt, or first 
committed, in the case of revolving credit debt; provided that if such 
Indebtedness is incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a 
foreign currency, and such refinancing would cause the applicable U.S. 
dollar-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant 
currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such U.S. 
dollar-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so 
long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not 
exceed (A) the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced plus 
(B) the aggregate amount of fees, underwriting discounts, premiums 
(including tender premiums) and other costs and expenses (including 
original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) incurred in 
connection with such refinancing.
 
-79-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
The principal amount of any Indebtedness incurred to refinance other 
Indebtedness, if incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness 
being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate 
applicable to the currencies in which such respective Indebtedness is 
denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Issuer shall not, and shall 
not permit the Co-Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor to, directly or 
indirectly, incur any Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) that 
is contractually subordinated or junior in right of payment to any 
Indebtedness of the Issuer, the Co-Issuer or such Guarantor, as the case 
may be, unless such Indebtedness is expressly subordinated in right of 
payment to the Notes or such Guarantors Guarantee to the extent and in the 
same manner as such Indebtedness is subordinated to other Indebtedness of 
the Issuer, the Co-Issuer or such Guarantor, as the case may be.

This Indenture shall not treat (1) unsecured Indebtedness as subordinated 
or junior to Secured Indebtedness merely because it is unsecured or (2) 
Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to any other Indebtedness merely 
because it has a junior priority with respect to the same collateral or 
because it is guaranteed by other obligors.

Section 4.10. Asset Sales.

(a) The Issuer shall not, and shall not permit any of its Restricted 
Subsidiaries to, consummate an Asset Sale, unless:

(i) the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives 
consideration at the time of such Asset Sale at least equal to the fair 
market value (as determined in good faith by the Issuer at the time of 
contractually agreeing to such Asset Sale) of the assets sold or otherwise 
disposed of; and

(ii) except in the case of a Permitted Asset Swap, at least 75.0% of the 
consideration for such Asset Sale, together with all other Asset Sales 
since the Issue Date (on a cumulative basis), received by the Issuer or 
such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the form of Cash 
Equivalents; provided that the amount of:

(A) any liabilities (as shown on the Issuers or such Restricted 
Subsidiarys most recent balance sheet or in the footnotes thereto or, if 
incurred or increased subsequent to the date of such balance sheet, such 
liabilities that would have been shown on the Issuers or such Restricted 
Subsidiarys balance sheet or in the footnotes thereto if such incurrence 
or increase had taken place on or prior to the date of such balance sheet, 
as determined by the Issuer) of the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, 
other than liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the Notes, 
that are assumed by the transferee of any such assets pursuant to a written 
agreement which releases or indemnifies the Issuer or such Restricted 
Subsidiary from such liabilities;

(B) any securities, notes or other obligations or assets received by the 
Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are 
converted by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary into Cash Equivalents 
(to the extent of the Cash Equivalents received) within 180 days (365 days 
in the case of any securities, notes or other obligations or assets 
received in respect of any Asset Sale of the Specified Real Property 
Assets) following the closing of such Asset Sale; and

(C) any Designated Non-cash Consideration received by the Issuer or such 
Restricted Subsidiary in such Asset Sale having an aggregate fair market 
value, taken together with all other Designated Non-cash Consideration 
received pursuant to this clause (C) that is at that time outstanding, not 
to exceed the greater of (i) $75.0 million and (ii) 5.0% of Total Assets at 
the time of the receipt of such Designated Non-cash Consideration, with the 
fair market value of each item of Designated Non-cash Consideration being 
measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent 
changes in value,

shall be deemed to be Cash Equivalents for purposes of this provision and 
for no other purpose.
 
-80-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(b) Within 365 days after the receipt of any Net Proceeds of any Asset 
Sale, the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, at its option, may apply 
the Net Proceeds from such Asset Sale:

(i) to permanently reduce Indebtedness as follows:

(A) Obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, and to 
correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto;

(B) Obligations under Secured Indebtedness which is secured by a Lien that 
is permitted by this Indenture, and to correspondingly reduce commitments 
with respect thereto;

(C) Obligations under the Notes or any other Senior Indebtedness of the 
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (and, in the case of other Senior 
Indebtedness, to correspondingly reduce any outstanding commitments with 
respect thereto, if applicable); provided that if the Issuer or any 
Restricted Subsidiary shall so repay any Senior Indebtedness other than the 
Notes, the Issuer will either (A) reduce Obligations under the Notes on a 
pro rata basis by, at its option, (x) redeeming Notes as provided under 
Section 3.07 hereof or (y) purchasing Notes through open-market purchases, 
or (B) make an offer (in accordance with the procedures set forth in 
Sections 3.08 and 4.10(c) hereof) to all Holders to purchase their Notes on 
a ratable basis with such other Senior Indebtedness for no less than 100.0% 
of the principal amount of such Notes, plus the amount of accrued but 
unpaid interest, if any, on the principal amount of the Notes to be 
repurchased, to, but excluding, the date of repurchase; or

(D) if the assets that are the subject of such Asset Sale are the property 
or assets of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not the Co-Issuer or a 
Guarantor, to permanently reduce Indebtedness of (i) a Restricted 
Subsidiary that is not the Co-Issuer or a Guarantor, other than 
Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, or (ii) the 
Issuer or a Subsidiary Guarantor; or

(ii) to make (A) an Investment in any one or more businesses, provided 
that such Investment in any business is in the form of the acquisition of 
Capital Stock and results in the Issuer or any of its Restricted 
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, owning an amount of the Capital Stock of 
such business such that it constitutes a Restricted Subsidiary, (B) capital 
expenditures or (C) acquisitions of other assets, in each of (A), (B) and 
(C), used or useful in a Similar Business; or

(iii) to make an Investment in (A) any one or more businesses, provided 
that such Investment in any business is in the form of the acquisition of 
Capital Stock and results in the Issuer or any of its Restricted 
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, owning an amount of the Capital Stock of 
such business such that it constitutes a Restricted Subsidiary, (B) capital 
expenditures, (C) properties or (D) acquisitions of other assets that, in 
each of (A), (B), (C) and (D), replace the businesses, properties and/or 
assets that are the subject of such Asset Sale;

provided that a binding commitment entered into not later than such 365th 
day shall be treated as a permitted application of the Net Proceeds from 
the date of such commitment so long as the Issuer or such Restricted 
Subsidiary enters into such commitment with the good faith expectation that 
such Net Proceeds will be applied to satisfy such commitment within the 
later of such 365th day and 180 days of such commitment (an Acceptable 
Commitment) and, in the event any Acceptable Commitment is later cancelled 
or terminated for any reason before the Net Proceeds are applied in 
connection therewith, the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary enters into 
another Acceptable Commitment (a Second Commitment) within 180 days of 
such cancellation or termination; provided further that if any Second 
Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before such Net 
Proceeds are applied, then such Net Proceeds shall constitute Excess 
Proceeds.

(c) Any Net Proceeds from the Asset Sale that are not invested or applied 
as provided and within the time period set forth in Section 4.10(b) hereof 
will be deemed to constitute Excess Proceeds. When the aggregate amount 
of Excess Proceeds exceeds $75.0 million, the Issuers shall make an offer 
(an Asset Sale Offer) to all Holders of the Notes and, if required by the 
terms of any Indebtedness that ranks pari passu with the Notes (Pari
 
-81-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Passu Indebtedness), to the holders of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, to 
purchase the maximum aggregate principal amount of the Notes and such Pari 
Passu Indebtedness that is in an amount equal to at least $2,000, or an 
integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof, that may be purchased out of 
the Excess Proceeds at an offer price, in the case of the Notes, in cash in 
an amount equal to 100.0% of the principal amount thereof (or accreted 
value thereof, if less), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the 
date fixed for the closing of such offer, and in the case of any Pari Passu 
Indebtedness at the offer price required by the terms thereof but not to 
exceed 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid 
interest, if any, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this 
Indenture and the agreement(s) governing such Pari Passu Indebtedness. The 
Issuers will commence an Asset Sale Offer with respect to Excess Proceeds 
within ten Business Days after the date that Excess Proceeds exceed $75.0 
million by delivering the notice required pursuant to the terms of this 
Indenture, with a copy to the Trustee. The Issuers may satisfy the 
foregoing obligations with respect to any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale 
by making an Asset Sale Offer with respect to such Net Proceeds prior to 
the expiration of the relevant 365 days (or such longer period provided 
above) or with respect to Excess Proceeds of $75.0 million or less.

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and such Pari Passu 
Indebtedness, as the case may be, tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer 
is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Issuers may use any remaining Excess 
Proceeds for any purposes not otherwise prohibited under this Indenture. If 
the aggregate principal amount of Notes or the Pari Passu Indebtedness, as 
the case may be, surrendered by such holders thereof exceeds the amount of 
Excess Proceeds, the Issuers shall purchase the Notes and such Pari Passu 
Indebtedness, as the case may be, on a pro rata basis based on the accreted 
value or principal amount of the Notes or such Pari Passu Indebtedness, as 
the case may be, tendered with adjustments as necessary so that no Notes or 
Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, will be repurchased in part in 
an unauthorized denomination. Upon completion of any such Asset Sale Offer, 
the amount of Excess Proceeds that resulted in the requirement to make an 
Asset Sale Offer shall be reset to zero (regardless of whether there are 
any remaining Excess Proceeds upon such completion). Additionally, the 
Issuers may, at their option, make an Asset Sale Offer using the proceeds 
from any Asset Sale at any time after the consummation of such Asset Sale. 
Upon consummation or expiration of any Asset Sale Offer, any remaining Net 
Proceeds shall not be deemed Excess Proceeds and the Issuers may use such 
Net Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited under this Indenture.

(d) Pending the final application of any Net Proceeds pursuant to this 
Section 4.10, the holder of such Net Proceeds may apply such Net Proceeds 
temporarily to reduce Indebtedness outstanding under a revolving credit 
facility, including under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, or 
otherwise invest such Net Proceeds in any manner not prohibited by this 
Indenture.

(e) The notice, if delivered electronically or mailed in a manner herein 
provided, shall be conclusively presumed to have been given, whether or not 
the Holder receives such notice. If (i) the notice is delivered 
electronically or mailed in a manner herein provided and (ii) any Holder 
fails to receive such notice or a Holder receives such notice but it is 
defective, such Holders failure to receive such notice or such defect 
shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the purchase of the 
Notes as to all other Holders that properly received such notice without 
defect. The Issuers shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under 
the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder 
to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with 
the repurchase by the Issuers of the Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. 
To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations 
conflict with the provisions of this Indenture, the Issuers shall comply 
with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed 
to have breached its obligations described in this Indenture by virtue 
thereof.

The provisions of this Section 4.10 may be waived or modified with the 
written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of all the 
Notes then outstanding.

Section 4.11. Transactions with Affiliates.

(a) The Issuer shall not, and shall not permit any of its Restricted 
Subsidiaries to, make any payment to, or sell, lease, transfer or otherwise 
dispose of any of its properties or assets to, or purchase any property or 
assets from, or enter into or make or amend any transaction, contract, 
agreement, understanding, loan, advance or guarantee with, or for the 
benefit of, any Affiliate of the Issuer (each of the foregoing, an 
Affiliate Transaction) involving aggregate payments or consideration in 
excess of $25.0 million, unless:

(i) such Affiliate Transaction is on terms that are not materially less 
favorable to the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary than those 
that would have been obtained in a comparable transaction by the Issuer or 
such Restricted Subsidiary with an unrelated Person on an arms-length 
basis; and

(ii) the Issuer delivers to the Trustee with respect to any Affiliate 
Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions involving aggregate 
payments or consideration in excess of $50.0 million, a resolution adopted 
by the majority of the Board of Directors of the Issuer approving such 
Affiliate Transaction and set forth in an Officers Certificate certifying 
that such Affiliate Transaction complies with clause (i) of this Section 
4.11(a).

definition of Permitted Investments;

any prior year) and any termination fees pursuant to the Support and 
Services Agreement and (B) transactions pursuant to the Transaction 
Agreements, or, in the case of each of (A) and (B), any amendment thereto 
or replacement thereof so long as any such amendment or replacement is not 
materially disadvantageous in the good faith judgment of the Board of

to the applicable agreement as in effect immediately prior to such 
amendment or replacement;

(iv) (A) employment agreements, employee benefit and incentive compensation

Restricted Subsidiaries;

(v) transactions in which the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, 
as the case may be, delivers to the Trustee a letter from an Independent 
Financial Advisor stating that such transaction is fair to the Issuer or 
such Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view or stating that 
the terms are not materially less favorable, when taken as a whole, to the 
Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary than those that would have 
been obtained in a comparable transaction by the Issuer or such Restricted 
Subsidiary with an unrelated Person on an arms-length basis;

(vi) any agreement or arrangement as in effect as of the Issue Date, or any 
amendment thereto (so long as any such amendment is not disadvantageous in 
any material respect in the good faith judgment of the Issuer to the 
Holders when taken as a whole as compared to the applicable agreement as in 
effect on the Issue Date);

(vii) the existence of, or the performance by the Issuer or any of its 
Restricted Subsidiaries of its obligations under the terms of, any

purchase agreement related thereto) to which it (or any parent company of 
the Issuer) is a party as of the Issue Date and any similar agreements 
which it (or any parent company of the Issuer) may enter into thereafter; 
provided that the existence of, or the performance by the Issuer or any of 
its Restricted Subsidiaries (or such parent company) of obligations under 
any future amendment to any such existing agreement or under any similar 
agreement entered into after the Issue Date shall only be permitted by this 
clause (vii) to the extent that the terms of any such amendment or new 
agreement are not otherwise disadvantageous in any material respect in the 
good faith judgment of the Issuer to the Holders when taken as a whole;
 
-83-

be entered into in connection with, or contemplated by, the Spin-Off

(x) the issuance or transfer of Equity Interests (other than Disqualified 
Stock) of the Issuer to any direct or indirect parent company of the Issuer

Section 4.12. Liens. The Issuer will not, and will not permit the Co-Issuer 
or any Subsidiary Guarantor to, directly or indirectly, create, incur,

Obligations under any Indebtedness or any related guarantee of 
Indebtedness, on any asset or property of the Issuer, the Co-Issuer or any 
Subsidiary Guarantor, or any income or profits therefrom, or assign or 
convey any right to receive income therefrom, unless:

related Subsidiary Guarantees are secured by a Lien on such property, 
assets or proceeds that is senior in priority to such Liens; and

(b) in all other cases, the Notes or the Subsidiary Guarantees are equally 
and ratably secured,

Section 4.13. Company Existence. Subject to Article 5 hereof, the Issuer 
shall do or cause to be done all things necessary to preserve and keep in 
full force and effect its limited liability company existence and the 
corporate, partnership, limited liability company or other existence of 
each of its Restricted Subsidiaries (including the Co-Issuer), in 
accordance with the respective organizational documents (as the same may be 
amended from time to time) of the Issuer or any such Restricted Subsidiary; 
provided that the Issuer shall not be required to preserve the corporate, 
partnership or other existence of its Restricted Subsidiaries (other than 
the Co-Issuer), if the Issuer in good faith shall determine that the 
preservation thereof is no longer desirable in the conduct of the business 
of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. For the 
avoidance of doubt, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will be 
permitted to change their organizational form; provided that for so long as 
an Issuer is organized as a partnership or a limited liability company, it 
will maintain a corporate co-issuer of the Notes.

Section 4.14. Offer to Repurchase Upon Change of Control Triggering Event. 
If a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs, unless the Issuers have 
previously or concurrently sent a redemption notice with respect to all the 
outstanding Notes as described under Sections 3.03 and 3.07 hereof, the 
Issuers shall make an offer to purchase all of the Notes pursuant to the 
offer described below (the Change of Control Offer) at a price in cash 
(the Change of Control Payment) equal to 101.0% of the aggregate 
principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional 
Interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of purchase, subject to the 
right of Holders of record on the relevant Record Date to receive interest 
due on the relevant Interest Payment Date falling prior to or on the 
purchase date. Within 30 days following any Change of Control Triggering 
Event, the Issuers will send notice of such Change of Control Offer 
electronically or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each 
Holder to the address of such Holder appearing in the Note Register or 
otherwise delivered in accordance with the Applicable Procedures with the 
following information:

(a) that a Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to this Section 
4.14 and that all Notes properly tendered pursuant to such Change of 
Control Offer will be accepted for payment by the Issuers;
 
-85-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(b) the purchase price and the purchase date, which will be no earlier than 
15 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is sent (the 
Change of Control Payment Date), except in the case of a conditional 
Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering 
Event in accordance with clause (l) of this Section 4.14;

(c) that any Note not properly tendered will remain outstanding and 
continue to accrue interest;

(d) that unless the Issuers default in the payment of the Change of Control 
Payment, all Notes accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control 
Offer shall cease to accrue interest on the Change of Control Payment Date;

(e) that Holders electing to have any Notes purchased pursuant to a Change 
of Control Offer shall be required to surrender such Notes, with the form 
entitled Option of Holder to Elect Purchase on the reverse of such Notes 
completed or otherwise in accordance with the Applicable Procedures, to the 
Paying Agent specified in the notice at the address specified in the notice 
prior to the close of business on the third Business Day preceding the 
Change of Control Payment Date;

(f) that Holders shall be entitled to withdraw their tendered Notes and 
their election to require the Issuers to purchase such Notes; provided 
that the Paying Agent receives, not later than the close of business on the 
second Business Day prior to the expiration date of the Change of Control 
Offer, a facsimile transmission, letter or other communication in 
accordance with the Applicable Procedures setting forth the name of the 
Holder of the Notes, the principal amount of Notes tendered for purchase, 
and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing its tendered Notes, or a 
specified portion thereof, and its election to have such Notes purchased;

(g) that Holders whose Notes are being purchased only in part shall be 
issued new Notes and such new Notes will be equal in principal amount to 
the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered. The unpurchased portion 
of the Notes must be equal to at least $2,000 or any integral multiple of 
$1,000 in excess of $2,000;

(h) if such notice is delivered prior to the occurrence of a Change of 
Control Triggering Event, stating that the Change of Control Offer is 
conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control Triggering Event 
and shall describe each such condition, and, if applicable, shall state 
that, in the Issuers discretion, the Change of Control Payment Date may be 
delayed until such time (including more than 60 days after the notice is 
mailed or delivered, including by electronic transmission) as any such 
condition shall be satisfied, or that such repurchase may not occur and 
such notice may be rescinded in the event that any such condition shall not 
have been satisfied by the Change of Control Payment Date, or by the Change 
of Control Payment Date as so delayed; and

(i) any other instructions, as determined by the Issuers, consistent with 
this Section 4.14 that a Holder must follow in order to have the Notes 
repurchased.

The notice, if delivered electronically or mailed in a manner herein 
provided, shall be conclusively presumed to have been given, whether or not 
the Holder receives such notice. If (a) the notice is delivered or mailed 
in a manner herein provided and (b) any Holder fails to receive such notice 
or a Holder receives such notice but it is defective, such Holders failure 
to receive such notice or such defect shall not affect the validity of the 
proceedings for the purchase of the Notes as to all other Holders that 
properly received such notice without defect. The Issuers
 
-86-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and 
any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such 
laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase by the 
Issuers of Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that 
the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the 
provisions of this Indenture, the Issuers shall comply with the applicable 
securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached 
its obligations described in this Indenture by virtue thereof.

(j) On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuers shall, to the extent 
permitted by law:

(i) accept for payment all Notes issued by it or portions thereof properly

(ii) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the aggregate Change 
of Control Payment in respect of all Notes or portions thereof so tendered;

stating that such Notes or portions thereof have been tendered to and 
purchased by the Issuers.

(k) The Issuers shall not be required to make a Change of Control Offer 
following a Change of Control Triggering Event if a third party makes the 
Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in 
compliance with the requirements set forth in this Indenture applicable to 
a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuers and purchases all Notes 
validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer.

(l) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control 
Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event, 
conditional upon such Change of Control Triggering Event, if a definitive 
agreement is in place for the Change of Control Triggering Event at the 
time of making of the Change of Control Offer.

(m) Other than as specifically provided in this Section 4.14, any purchase 
pursuant to this Section 4.14 shall be made pursuant to the provisions of 
Sections 3.02, 3.05 and 3.06 hereof, and references therein to redeem, 
redemption, Redemption Date and similar words shall be deemed to refer 
to purchase, repurchase and Change of Control Payment Date and 
similar words, as applicable.

The provisions of this Section 4.14 may be waived or modified with the 
written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of all the 
Notes then outstanding.

Section 4.15. Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted 
Subsidiaries. The Issuer shall not permit any of its Wholly Owned 
Subsidiaries that are Restricted Subsidiaries (and non-Wholly Owned 
Subsidiaries if such non-Wholly Owned Subsidiaries guarantee other capital 
markets debt securities of the Issuer, the Co-Issuer or any Subsidiary 
Guarantor), other than a Subsidiary Guarantor, the Co-Issuer, a Foreign 
Subsidiary or a Securitization Subsidiary, to guarantee the payment of (i) 
any Credit Facility permitted under clause (i) of Section 4.09(b) hereof or 
(ii) capital markets debt securities of the Issuer, the Co-Issuer or any 
Subsidiary Guarantor unless:

(a) such Restricted Subsidiary within 60 days after the guarantee of such 
Indebtedness executes and delivers a supplemental indenture to this 
Indenture, the form of which is attached as Exhibit D hereto, providing for 
a Guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary, except that with respect to a 
guarantee of Indebtedness of the Issuer, the Co-Issuer or any Subsidiary 
Guarantor, if such Indebtedness is by its express terms subordinated in 
right of payment to the Notes or such Guarantors Guarantee, any such 
guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary with respect to such Indebtedness 
shall be subordinated in right of payment to such Guarantee substantially 
to the same extent as such Indebtedness is subordinated to the Notes; and

(b) such Restricted Subsidiary waives and shall not in any manner 
whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any rights of 
reimbursement, indemnity or subrogation or any other applicable rights 
against the Issuer or any other Restricted Subsidiary as a result of any 
payment by such Restricted Subsidiary under its Guarantee;
 
-87-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
provided that this Section 4.15 shall not be applicable to any guarantee of 
any Restricted Subsidiary that existed at the time such Person became a 
Restricted Subsidiary and was not incurred in connection with, or in 
contemplation of, such Person becoming a Restricted Subsidiary. The Issuer 
may elect, in its sole discretion, to cause any Subsidiary that is not 
otherwise required to be a Guarantor to become a Guarantor, in which case 
such Subsidiary shall not be required to comply with the 60 day period 
described in clause (a) of this Section 4.15.

Section 4.16. Limitations on Business Activities of the Co-Issuer.

The Co-Issuer may not hold any assets, become liable for any obligations or 
engage in any business activities; provided that it may be a co-obligor or 
guarantor with respect to the Notes or any other Indebtedness issued by the 
Issuer, and may engage in any activities related thereto or necessary in 
connection therewith. The Co-Issuer shall be a Wholly Owned Subsidiary of 
the Issuer at all times.

Section 4.17. Suspension of Covenants.

(a) If at any time (i) the Notes have an Investment Grade Rating from both 
of the Rating Agencies and (ii) no Default has occurred and is continuing 
under this Indenture, then, beginning on that day (the occurrence of the 
events described in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) being collectively 
referred to as a Covenant Suspension Event), each of Section 4.07, 
Section 4.08, Section 4.09, Section 4.10, Section 4.11, Section 4.15 and 
clause (iv) of Section 5.01(a) hereof shall no longer be applicable to the 
Notes (collectively, the Suspended Covenants).

(b) In the event that the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not 
subject to the Suspended Covenants under this Indenture for any period of 
time as a result of the foregoing, and on any subsequent date (the Re
version Date) either of the Rating Agencies rate the Notes below an 
Investment Grade Rating, then the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries 
will thereafter again be subject to the Suspended Covenants under this 
Indenture with respect to future events. The period of time between the 
Covenant Suspension Event and the Reversion Date is referred to as the 
Suspension Period. Upon the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event, the 
amount of Excess Proceeds from any Asset Sales shall be reset to zero.

(c) During the Suspension Period, the Issuer and its Restricted 
Subsidiaries shall be entitled to incur Liens to the extent provided for 
under Section 4.12 (including, without limitation, Permitted Liens) to the 
extent provided for in such section and any Permitted Liens which may refer 
to one or more Suspended Covenants shall be interpreted as though such 
applicable Suspended Covenant(s) continued to be applicable during the 
Suspension Period (but solely for purposes of Section 4.12 and no other 
section).

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of any such reinstatement 
of the Suspended Covenants, no action taken or omitted to be taken by the 
Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries prior to such reinstatement 
that was permitted at such time will give rise to a Default or Event of 
Default under this Indenture with respect to the Notes; provided, that (1) 
with respect to Restricted Payments made after such reinstatement, the 
amount available to be made as Restricted Payments will be calculated as 
though Section 4.07 had been in effect prior to, but not during, the 
Suspension Period; and (2) all Indebtedness incurred, or Disqualified Stock 
issued, during the Suspension Period will be classified to have been 
incurred or issued pursuant to clause (iii) of Section 4.09(b); (3) any 
Affiliate Transaction entered into after such reinstatement pursuant to an 
agreement entered into during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be 
permitted pursuant to clause (vi) of Section 4.11(b); (4) any encumbrance 
or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary that is not the 
Co-Issuer or a Guarantor to take any action described in clauses (i) 
through (iii) of Section 4.08(a) that becomes effective during any 
Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (i) of 
Section 4.08(b); and (5) no Subsidiary of the Issuer (other than the 
Co-Issuer) shall be required to comply with Section 4.15 after such 
reinstatement with respect to any guarantee entered into by such Subsidiary 
during any Suspension Period.

(e) The Trustee shall have no obligation to determine if the Notes have an 
Investment Grade Rating at any time or to provide Holders with notice of 
whether the Notes have an Investment Grade Rating or no longer have an 
Investment Grade Rating.

Subsidiaries, other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a Restricted 
Subsidiary, whether such Indebtedness or guarantee now exists or is created

such Indebtedness at its stated final maturity (after giving effect to any 
applicable grace periods) or relates to an obligation other than the 
obligation to pay principal of any such Indebtedness at its stated final 
maturity and results in the holder or holders of such Indebtedness causing

such judgment becomes final, and in the event such judgment is covered by 
insurance, an enforcement proceeding has been commenced by any creditor 
upon such judgment or decree which is not promptly stayed;

Subsidiaries is to be adjudicated bankrupt or insolvent;
 
-92-

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Subsidiary (or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that together (as of 
the latest audited consolidated financial statements of the Issuer for a 
fiscal quarter end provided as required under Section 4.03 hereof) would 
constitute a Significant Subsidiary), or for all or substantially all of 
the property of the Issuer, the Co-Issuer or any such Significant 
Subsidiary or such group of Restricted Subsidiaries; or

(C) orders the liquidation of the Issuer, the Co-Issuer or any Significant 
Subsidiary (or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that together (as of 
the latest audited consolidated financial statements of the Issuer for a 
fiscal quarter end provided as required under Section 4.03 hereof) would 
constitute a Significant Subsidiary);

and the order or decree remains unstayed and in effect for 60 consecutive

(viii) the Guarantee of HGV Parent, HGV Intermediate Parent or any 
Significant Subsidiary (or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that

Issuer for a fiscal quarter end provided as required under Section 4.03 
hereof) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) shall for any reason 
cease to be in full force and effect or be declared null and void or any

consolidated financial statements of the Issuer for a fiscal quarter end 
provided as required under Section 4.03 hereof) would constitute a 
Significant Subsidiary), as the case may be, denies in writing that it has 
any further liability under its Guarantee or gives written notice to such 
effect, other than by reason of the termination of this Indenture or the 
release of any such Guarantee in accordance with this Indenture.

(b) In the event of any Event of Default specified in clause (iv) of 
Section 6.01(a) hereof, such Event of Default and all consequences thereof 
(excluding any resulting payment default, other than as a result of 
acceleration of the Notes) shall be annulled, waived and rescinded, 
automatically and without any action by the Trustee or the Holders, if 
within 30 days after such Event of Default arose:

(i) the Indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for such Event of 
Default has been discharged;

(ii) the requisite number of holders thereof have rescinded or waived the 
acceleration, notice or action (as the case may be) giving rise to such 
Event of Default; or

(iii) the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has been 
cured.

Section 6.02. Acceleration. If any Event of Default (other than an Event of 
Default of the type specified in clause (vi) or (vii) of Section 6.01(a) 
hereof) occurs and is continuing under this Indenture, the Trustee or the 
Holders of not less than 25.0% in aggregate principal amount of all the 
then outstanding Notes may, by notice to the Issuers and the Trustee, in 
either case specifying in such notice the respective Event of Default and 
that such notice is a notice of acceleration, declare the principal, 
premium, if any, interest and any other monetary obligations on all the 
then outstanding Notes to be due and payable immediately.

Upon the effectiveness of such declaration, such principal of and premium, 
if any, and interest will be due and payable immediately.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an Event of Default arising 
under clause (vi) or (vii) of Section 6.01(a) hereof, all outstanding Notes 
will become due and payable without further action or notice. The Trustee 
may withhold from the Holders notice of any continuing Default, except a 
Default relating to the payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest, 
if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest. In addition, 
subject to Section 6.05, the Trustee will have no obligation to accelerate 
the Notes if in the judgment of the Trustee acceleration is not in the 
interests of the Holders of all of the Notes.
 
-93-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Section 6.03. Other Remedies. If an Event of Default occurs and is 
continuing, the Trustee may pursue any available remedy to collect the 
payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes or to 
enforce the performance of any provision of the Notes or this Indenture.

The Trustee may maintain a proceeding even if it does not possess any of 
the Notes or does not produce any of them in the proceeding. A delay or 
omission by the Trustee or any Holder of a Note in exercising any right or 
remedy accruing upon an Event of Default shall not impair the right or 
remedy or constitute a waiver of or acquiescence in the Event of Default. 
All remedies are cumulative to the extent permitted by law.

Section 6.04. Waiver of Past Defaults. Holders of a majority in aggregate 
principal amount of all the Notes then outstanding, by written notice to 
the Trustee (with a copy to the Issuers, provided that any waiver or 
rescission under this Section 6.04 shall be valid and binding 
notwithstanding the failure to provide a copy of such notice to the 
Issuers) may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes waive any 
existing Default and its consequences under this Indenture (except a 
continuing Default in the payment of interest on, premium, if any, or the 
principal of any Note held by a non-consenting Holder) (including in 
connection with an Asset Sale Offer or a Change of Control Offer) and 
rescind any acceleration with respect to the Notes and its consequences 
under this Indenture (except if such rescission would conflict with any 
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction). Upon any such waiver, such 
Default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom 
shall be deemed to have been cured for every purpose of this Indenture; but 
no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair 
any right consequent thereto.

Section 6.05. Control by Majority. Subject to Section 7.01(e) hereof, the 
Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of all the then 
outstanding Notes may direct the time, method and place of conducting any 
proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the Trustee or of 
exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee and the Trustee may 
take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee that is not inconsistent 
with such direction. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any 
direction that conflicts with law or this Indenture or that the Trustee 
determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that 
would involve the Trustee in personal liability.

Section 6.06. Limitation on Suits. Subject to Section 6.07 hereof, no 
Holder of a Note may pursue any remedy with respect to this Indenture or 
the Notes unless:

(a) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an 
Event of Default is continuing;

(b) the Holders of at least 25.0% in the aggregate principal amount of the 
then outstanding Notes have requested in writing the Trustee to pursue the 
remedy;

(c) the Holders of the Notes have offered the Trustee security or indemnity 
satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense;

(d) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the 
receipt thereof and the offer of security or indemnity; and

(e) the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of all the then 
outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a direction in writing 
inconsistent with such written request within such 60-day period.

Section 6.07. Rights of Holders to Receive Payment. Notwithstanding any 
other provision of this Indenture, the contractual right expressly set 
forth in this Indenture or the Notes of any Holder of a Note to receive 
payment of principal, premium, if any, and Additional Interest, if any, and 
interest on the Note, on or after the respective due dates expressed in the 
Note (including in connection with an Asset Sale Offer or a Change of 
Control Offer), or to bring suit for the enforcement of any such payment on 
or after such respective dates, shall not be impaired or affected without 
the consent of such Holder.

Section 6.08. Collection Suit by Trustee. If an Event of Default specified 
in Section 6.01(a)(i) or (ii) hereof occurs and is continuing, the Trustee 
is authorized to recover judgment in its own name and as trustee of an 
express trust against the Issuers for the whole amount of principal of, 
premium, if any, Additional Interest, if any, and interest remaining unpaid 
on, the Notes and interest on overdue principal, if applicable, and, to the 
extent lawful, interest and such further amount as shall be sufficient to 
cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable 
compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its 
agents and counsel.

Section 6.09. Restoration of Rights and Remedies. If the Trustee or any 
Holder has instituted any proceeding to enforce any right or remedy under 
this Indenture and such proceeding has been discontinued or abandoned for 
any reason, or has been determined adversely to the Trustee or to such 
Holder, then and in every such case, subject to any determination in such 
proceedings, the Issuers, the Trustee and the Holders shall be restored 
severally and respectively to their former positions hereunder and 
thereafter all rights and remedies of the Trustee and the Holders shall 
continue as though no such proceeding has been instituted.

Section 6.10. Rights and Remedies Cumulative. Except as otherwise provided 
with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or 
stolen Notes in Section 2.07 hereof, no right or remedy herein conferred 
upon or reserved to the Trustee or to the Holders is intended to be 
exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and remedy shall, 
to the extent permitted by law, be cumulative and in addition to every 
other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law 
or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or 
remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion 
or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy.

Section 6.11. Delay or Omission Not Waiver. No delay or omission of the 
Trustee or of any Holder to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any 
Event of Default shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a 
waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence therein. Every right 
and remedy given by this Article 6 or by law to the Trustee or to the 
Holders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may be deemed 
expedient, by the Trustee or by the Holders, as the case may be.

Section 6.12. Trustee May File Proofs of Claim. The Trustee is authorized 
to file such proofs of claim and other papers or documents as may be 
necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee 
(including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, 
disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel) and the 
Holders allowed in any judicial proceedings relative to the Issuers (or any 
other obligor upon the Notes including the Guarantors), their creditors or 
their property and shall be entitled and empowered to participate as a 
member in any official committee of creditors appointed in such matter and 
to collect, receive and distribute any money or other property payable or 
deliverable on any such claims and any custodian in any such judicial 
proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such payments to the 
Trustee, and in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of 
such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due 
to it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances 
of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the 
Trustee under Section 7.07 hereof. To the extent that the payment of any 
such compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its 
agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 
7.07 hereof out of the estate in any such proceeding, shall be denied for 
any reason, payment of the same shall be secured by a Lien on, and shall be 
paid out of, any and all distributions, dividends, money, securities and 
other properties that the Holders may be entitled to receive in such 
proceeding whether in liquidation or under any plan of reorganization or 
arrangement or otherwise. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to 
authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on 
behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or 
composition affecting the Notes or the rights of any Holder, or to 
authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any 
such proceeding.

Section 6.13. Priorities. If the Trustee or any Agent collects any money or 
property pursuant to this Article 6, it shall pay out the money or property 
in the following order:

(a) FIRST, to the Trustee, such Agent, their agents and attorneys for 
amounts due under Section 7.07 hereof, including payment of all 
compensation, expenses and liabilities incurred, and all advances made, by 
the Trustee or such Agent and the costs and expenses of collection;
 
-95-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(b) SECOND, to Holders for amounts due and unpaid on the Notes for 
principal, premium, if any, Additional Interest, if any, and interest, 
ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the 
amounts due and payable on the Notes for principal, premium, if any, and 
interest, respectively; and

(c) THIRD, to the Issuers or to such party as a court of competent 
jurisdiction shall direct including a Guarantor, if applicable.

The Trustee may fix a record date and payment date for any payment to 
Holders pursuant to this Section 6.13.

Section 6.14. Undertaking for Costs. In any suit for the enforcement of any 
right or remedy under this Indenture or in any suit against the Trustee for 
any action taken or omitted by it as a Trustee, a court in its discretion 
may require the filing by any party litigant in the suit of an undertaking 
to pay the costs of the suit, and the court in its discretion may assess 
reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses, 
against any party litigant in the suit, having due regard to the merits and 
good faith of the claims or defenses made by the party litigant. This 
Section 6.14 does not apply to a suit by the Trustee, a suit by a Holder of 
a Note pursuant to Section 6.07 hereof, or a suit by Holders of more than 
10.0% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes.

TRUSTEE

Section 7.01. Duties of Trustee.

(a) If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee 
shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this 
Indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in its exercise, as a 
prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct 
of such persons own affairs.

(b) Except during the continuance of an Event of Default:

(i) the duties of the Trustee shall be determined solely by the express 
provisions of this Indenture and the Trustee need perform only those duties 
that are specifically set forth in this Indenture and no others, and no 
implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Indenture against 
the Trustee; and

(ii) in the absence of willful misconduct or bad faith on its part, the 
Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the 
correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon certificates or 
opinions furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of 
this Indenture. However, in the case of any such certificates or opinions 
which by any provision hereof are specifically required to be furnished to 
the Trustee, the Trustee shall examine the certificates and opinions to 
determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture 
(but need not investigate or confirm the accuracy of mathematical 
calculations or other facts stated therein).

(c) The Trustee may not be relieved from liabilities for its own negligent 
action, its own negligent failure to act, or its own willful misconduct, 
except that:

(i) this paragraph does not limit the effect of paragraph (b) of this 
Section 7.01;

(ii) the Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good 
faith by a Responsible Officer, unless it is proved in a court of competent 
jurisdiction that the Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent 
facts; and

(iii) the Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action it takes 
or omits to take in good faith in accordance with a direction received by 
it pursuant to Section 6.02, 6.04 or 6.05 hereof.

(d) Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this 
Indenture that in any way relates to the Trustee is subject to paragraphs 
(a), (b) and (c) of this Section 7.01.
 
-96-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(e) The Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights 
or powers under this Indenture at the request or direction of any of the 
Holders unless the Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity or 
security satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense.

(f) The Trustee shall not be liable for interest on any money received by 
it except as the Trustee may agree in writing with the Issuers. Money held 
in trust by the Trustee need not be segregated from other funds except to 
the extent required by law.

Section 7.02. Rights of Trustee.

(a) The Trustee may conclusively rely upon any document believed by it to 
be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper Person. The 
Trustee need not investigate any fact or matter stated in the document, but 
the Trustee, in its discretion, may make such further inquiry or 
investigation into such facts or matters as it may see fit, and, if the 
Trustee shall determine to make such further inquiry or investigation, it 
shall be entitled to examine the books, records and premises of the Issuers 
and its Restricted Subsidiaries, personally or by agent or attorney at the 
sole cost of the Issuers and shall incur no liability or additional 
liability of any kind by reason of such inquiry or investigation.

(b) Before the Trustee acts or refrains from acting, it may require an 
Officers Certificate or an Opinion of Counsel or both. The Trustee shall 
not be liable for any action it takes or omits to take in good faith in 
reliance on such Officers Certificate or Opinion of Counsel. The Trustee 
may consult with counsel of its selection and the advice of such counsel or 
any Opinion of Counsel shall be full and complete authorization and 
protection from liability in respect of any action taken, suffered or 
omitted by it hereunder in good faith and in reliance thereon.

(c) The Trustee may act through its attorneys and agents and shall not be 
responsible for the misconduct or negligence of any agent or attorney 
appointed with due care.

(d) The Trustee shall not be liable for any action it takes or omits to 
take in good faith that it believes to be authorized or within the rights 
or powers conferred upon it by this Indenture.

(e) Unless otherwise specifically provided in this Indenture, any demand, 
request, direction or notice from the Issuer or the Co-Issuer shall be 
sufficient if signed by an Officer of the Issuer or the Co-Issuer, as 
applicable.

(f) None of the provisions of this Indenture shall require the Trustee to 
expend or risk its own funds or otherwise to incur any liability, financial 
or otherwise, in the performance of any of its duties hereunder, or in the 
exercise of any of its rights or powers if an indemnity satisfactory to it 
against such risk or liability is not assured to it.

(g) The Trustee shall not be deemed to have notice of any Default or Event 
of Default unless a Responsible Officer of the Trustee has actual knowledge 
thereof or unless written notice of any event which is in fact such a 
Default or Event of Default is received by the Trustee at the Corporate 
Trust Office, and such notice references the Notes and this Indenture.

(h) In no event shall the Trustee be responsible or liable for special, 
indirect, or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever 
(including, but not limited to, loss of profit) irrespective of whether the 
Trustee has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage and 
regardless of the form of action.

(i) The rights, privileges, protections, immunities and benefits given to 
the Trustee, including, without limitation, its right to be indemnified, 
are extended to, and shall be enforceable by, the Trustee in each of its 
capacities hereunder, and each agent, custodian and other Person employed 
to act hereunder.

(j) In the event the Issuers are required to pay Additional Interest, the 
Issuers will provide written notice to the Trustee of the Issuers 
obligation to pay Additional Interest no later than 15 days prior to the 
next Interest Payment Date, which notice shall set forth the amount of the 
Additional Interest to be paid by the Issuers. The Trustee shall not at any 
time be under any duty or responsibility to any Holders to determine 
whether the Additional Interest is payable and the amount thereof.
 
-97-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(k) Delivery of reports, information and documents (including without 
limitation reports contemplated under Section 4.03 hereof) to the Trustee 
is for informational purposes only and the Trustees receipt of such shall 
not constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein or 
determinable from information contained therein, including the Issuers 
compliance with any of their covenants hereunder (as to which the Trustee 
is entitled to rely exclusively on Officers Certificates).

(l) The permissive rights of the Trustee to take certain actions under this 
Indenture shall not be construed as a duty unless so specified herein.

(m) The Trustee shall not be bound to make any investigation into the facts 
or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, 
opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order, approval, bond, 
debenture, note or other paper or document unless requested in writing to 
do so by the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the 
Notes at the time outstanding, but the Trustee, in its discretion, may make 
such further inquiry or investigation into such facts or matters as it may 
see fit, and, if the Trustee shall determine to make such further inquiry 
or investigation, it shall be entitled to examine the books, records and 
premises of the Issuers, personally or by agent or attorney, at the expense 
of the Issuers and shall incur no liability of any kind by reason of such 
inquiry or investigation.

Certificate setting forth the names of individuals and/or titles of 
officers authorized at such time to take specified actions pursuant to this 
Indenture, which Officers Certificate may be signed by any Person 
authorized to sign an Officers Certificate, including any Person specified 
as so authorized in any such certificate previously delivered and not 
superseded.

(o) The Trustee shall not be responsible or liable for any failure or delay 
in the performance of its obligations under this Indenture arising out of 
or caused, directly or indirectly, by circumstances beyond its reasonable 
control, including, without limitation, acts of God; earthquakes; fire; 
flood; terrorism; wars and other military disturbances; sabotage; 
epidemics; riots; loss or malfunction of utilities, computer (hardware or 
software) or communication services; strikes or similar labor disputes; and 
acts of civil or military authorities and governmental action.

(p) The Trustee shall have no duty to inquire as to the performance of the 
Issuers with respect to the covenants contained in Article 4 or to make any 
calculation in connection therewith or in connection with any redemption of 
the Notes. In addition, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the 
Trustee shall have no obligation to monitor or verify compliance by the 
Issuers or any Guarantor with any other obligation or covenant under this 
Indenture.

Section 7.03. Individual Rights of Trustee. The Trustee in its individual 
or any other capacity may become the owner or pledgee of Notes and may 
otherwise deal with the Issuers or any of their Affiliates with the same 
rights it would have if it were not Trustee. However, in the event that the 
Trustee acquires any conflicting interest (as such term is used in the 
Trust Indenture Act) it must eliminate such conflict within 90 days, apply 
to the SEC for permission to continue as Trustee (if this Indenture has 
been qualified under the Trust Indenture Act) or resign. Any Agent may do 
the same with like rights and duties. The Trustee is also subject to 
Sections 7.10 and 7.11 hereof.

Section 7.04. Trustees Disclaimer. The Trustee shall not be responsible 
for and makes no representation as to the validity or adequacy of this 
Indenture or the Notes, it shall not be accountable for the Issuers use of 
the proceeds from the Notes or any money paid to the Issuers or upon the 
Issuers direction under any provision of this Indenture, it shall not be 
responsible for the use or application of any money received by any Paying 
Agent other than the Trustee, and it shall not be responsible for any 
statement or recital herein or any statement in the Notes or any other 
document in connection with the sale of the Notes or pursuant to this 
Indenture other than its certificate of authentication.
 
-98-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Section 7.05. Notice of Defaults. If a Default occurs and is continuing and 
if it is known to a Responsible Officer of the Trustee, the Trustee shall 
deliver to Holders a notice of the Default within 90 days after it occurs, 
unless such Default shall have been cured or waived, or if discovered after 
90 days, promptly thereafter. The Trustee may withhold from the Holders 
notice of any continuing Default, except a Default relating to the payment 
of principal, premium, if any, or interest, if it determines that 
withholding notice is in their interest.

Section 7.06. Reports by Trustee to Holders. Within 60 days after each June 
1, beginning on June 1, 2017, and for so long as Notes remain outstanding, 
the Trustee shall send to the Holders a brief report dated as of such 
reporting date that complies with Trust Indenture Act Section 313(a) (but 
if no event described in Trust Indenture Act Section 313(a) has occurred 
within the twelve months preceding the reporting date, no report need be 
transmitted). The Trustee also shall comply with Trust Indenture Act 
Section 313(b)(2), to the extent applicable. The Trustee shall also send 
all reports as required by Trust Indenture Act Section 313(c).

A copy of each report at the time it is sent to the Holders shall be sent 
to the Issuers and filed with the SEC and each stock exchange on which the 
Notes are listed in accordance with Trust Indenture Act Section 313(d). The 
Issuers shall promptly notify the Trustee when the Notes are listed on any 
stock exchange or delisted therefrom.

Section 7.07. Compensation and Indemnity. The Issuers shall pay to the 
Trustee from time to time such compensation for its acceptance of this 
Indenture and services hereunder as the parties shall agree in writing from 
time to time. The Trustees compensation shall not be limited by any law on 
compensation of a trustee of an express trust. The Issuers shall reimburse 
the Trustee promptly upon request for all reasonable disbursements, 
advances and expenses incurred or made by it in addition to the 
compensation for its services. Such expenses shall include the reasonable 
compensation, disbursements and expenses of the Trustees agents and 
counsel.

The Issuers and the Guarantors, jointly and severally, shall indemnify the 
Trustee and its officers, directors, employees, agents and any predecessor 
trustee and its officers, directors, employees and agents for, and hold the 
Trustee harmless against, any and all loss, damage, claims, liability or 
expense (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) incurred by it 
in connection with the acceptance or administration of this trust and the 
performance of its duties hereunder (including the reasonable costs and 
expenses of enforcing this Indenture against the Issuers or any of the 
Guarantors (including this Section 7.07) or defending itself against any 
claim whether asserted by any Holder, the Issuers or any Guarantor, or 
liability in connection with the acceptance, exercise or performance of any 
of its powers or duties hereunder) (but excluding taxes imposed on such 
Persons in connection with compensation for such administration or 
performance). The Trustee shall notify the Issuers promptly of any claim of 
which a Responsible Officer has received written notice for which it may 
seek indemnity. Failure by the Trustee to so notify the Issuers shall not 
relieve the Issuers or the Guarantors of their obligations hereunder. The 
Issuers shall defend the claim and the Trustee may have separate counsel 
and the Issuers shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel. 
Neither the Issuers nor any Guarantor need reimburse any expense or 
indemnify against any loss, liability or expense incurred by the Trustee 
through the Trustees own willful misconduct, negligence or bad faith. 
Neither the Issuers nor any Guarantor need pay for any settlement made 
without its consent.

The obligations of the Issuers and the Guarantors under this Section 7.07 
shall survive the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture or the 
earlier resignation or removal of the Trustee.

To secure the payment obligations of the Issuers and the Guarantors in this 
Section 7.07, the Trustee shall have a Lien prior to the Notes on all money 
or property held or collected by the Trustee, except money or property held 
in trust to pay principal and interest on particular Notes. Such Lien shall 
survive the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture.

When the Trustee incurs expenses or renders services after an Event of 
Default specified in Section 6.01(a)(vi) or Section 6.01(a)(vii) hereof 
occurs, the expenses and the compensation for the services (including the 
reasonable fees and expenses of its agents and counsel) are intended to 
constitute expenses of administration under any Bankruptcy Law.

Section 7.08. Replacement of Trustee. A resignation or removal of the 
Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee shall become effective only 
upon the successor Trustees acceptance of appointment as provided in this 
Section 7.08. The Trustee may resign in writing at any time and be 
discharged from the trust hereby
 
-99-

------------------------------------------------------------------------

amount of the then outstanding Notes may remove the Trustee by so notifying

Act Section 310;

(b) the Trustee is adjudged bankrupt or insolvent or an order for relief is 
entered with respect to the Trustee under any Bankruptcy Law;

(c) a custodian or public officer takes charge of the Trustee or its 
property; or

If the Trustee resigns or is removed or if a vacancy exists in the office 
of Trustee for any reason, the Issuers shall promptly appoint a successor 
Trustee. Within one year after the successor Trustee takes office, the 
Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may 
appoint a successor Trustee to replace the successor Trustee appointed by 
the Issuers.

If a successor Trustee does not take office within 60 days after the 
retiring Trustee resigns or is removed, the retiring Trustee (at the 
Issuers expense), the Issuers or the Holders of at least 10% in principal 
amount of the then outstanding Notes, may petition any court of competent 
jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee.

If the Trustee, after written request by any Holder who has been a Holder 
for at least six months, fails to comply with Section 7.10 hereof, such 
Holder may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of 
the Trustee and the appointment of a successor Trustee.

A successor Trustee shall deliver a written acceptance of its appointment 
to the retiring Trustee and to the Issuers. Thereupon, the resignation or 
removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective, and the successor 
Trustee shall have all the rights, powers and duties of the Trustee under 
this Indenture. The successor Trustee shall send a notice of its succession 
to Holders. The retiring Trustee shall promptly transfer all property held 
by it as Trustee to the successor Trustee; provided all sums owing to the 
Trustee hereunder have been paid and subject to the Lien provided for in 
Section 7.07 hereof. Notwithstanding replacement of the Trustee pursuant to 
this Section 7.08, the Issuers obligations under Section 7.07 hereof shall 
continue for the benefit of the retiring Trustee.

Section 7.09. Successor Trustee by Merger, etc. If the Trustee 
consolidates, merges or converts into, or transfers all or substantially 
all of its corporate trust business to, another corporation, the successor 
corporation without any further act shall be the successor Trustee.

Section 7.10. Eligibility; Disqualification. There shall at all times be a 
Trustee hereunder that is a corporation organized and doing business under 
the laws of the United States of America or of any state thereof that is 
authorized under such laws to exercise corporate trustee power, that is 
subject to supervision or examination by federal or state authorities and 
that has, together with its parent, a combined capital and surplus of at 
least $150.0 million as set forth in its most recent published annual 
report of condition.

This Indenture shall always have a Trustee who satisfies the requirements 
of Trust Indenture Act Sections 310(a)(1), (2) and (5). The Trustee is 
subject to Trust Indenture Act Section 310(b).

Section 7.11. Preferential Collection of Claims Against Issuers. The 
Trustee is subject to Trust Indenture Act Section 311(a), excluding any 
creditor relationship listed in Trust Indenture Act Section 311(b). A 
Trustee who has resigned or been removed shall be subject to Trust 
Indenture Act Section 311(a) to the extent indicated therein.

ARTICLE 8
LEGAL DEFEASANCE AND COVENANT DEFEASANCE

Section 8.01. Option to Effect Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance . 
The Issuers may, at their option and at any time, elect to have either 
Section 8.02 or 8.03 hereof applied to all outstanding Notes and all 
obligations of the Guarantors with respect to the Guarantees upon 
compliance with the conditions set forth below in this Article 8.

Section 8.02. Legal Defeasance and Discharge. Upon the Issuers exercise 
under Section 8.01 hereof of the option applicable to this Section 8.02, 
the Issuers and the Guarantors shall, subject to the satisfaction of the 
conditions set forth in Section 8.04 hereof, be deemed to have been 
discharged from their obligations with respect to all outstanding Notes and 
the related Guarantees and all Events of Default cured on the date the 
conditions set forth below are satisfied (Legal Defeasance). For this 
purpose, Legal Defeasance means that the Issuers and the Guarantors shall 
be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire Indebtedness represented 
by the outstanding Notes, which shall thereafter be deemed to be 
outstanding only for the purposes of Section 8.05 hereof and the other 
Sections of this Indenture referred to in (a) and (b) below (it being 
understood that such Notes shall not be deemed outstanding for accounting 
purposes), and to have satisfied all their other obligations under such 
Notes and this Indenture including that of the Guarantors (and the Trustee, 
on demand of and at the expense of the Issuers, shall execute proper 
instruments acknowledging the same) and to have cured all then existing 
Events of Default, except for the following provisions which shall survive 
until otherwise terminated or discharged hereunder:

(a) the rights of Holders to receive payments in respect of the principal 
of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes when such payments are due 
solely out of the trust created pursuant to this Indenture referred to in 
Section 8.04 hereof;

(b) the Issuers obligations with respect to Notes concerning issuing 
temporary Notes, registration of such Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or 
stolen Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and 
money for security payments held in trust;

(c) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee, and 
the Issuers and the Guarantors obligations in connection therewith; and

(d) this Section 8.02.

Subject to compliance with this Article 8, the Issuers may exercise their 
option under this Section 8.02 notwithstanding the prior exercise of its 
option under Section 8.03 hereof.

Section 8.03. Covenant Defeasance. Upon the Issuers exercise under Section 
8.01 hereof of the option applicable to this Section 8.03, the Issuers and 
the Guarantors shall, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set 
forth in Section 8.04 hereof, be released from their obligations under 
Sections 3.08, 4.03, 4.04, 4.05, 4.07, 4.08, 4.09, 4.10, 4.11, 4.12, 4.13, 
4.14, 4.15 and 4.16 hereof, and clauses (iv) and (v) of Section 5.01(a), 
and Section 5.01(e) hereof with respect to all outstanding Notes and the 
related Guarantees, on and after the date the conditions set forth in 
Section 8.04 hereof are satisfied (Covenant Defeasance), and such Notes 
shall thereafter be deemed not outstanding for the purposes of any 
direction, waiver, consent or declaration or act of Holders (and the 
consequences of any thereof) in connection with such covenants, but shall 
continue to be deemed outstanding for all other purposes hereunder (it 
being understood that such Notes shall not be deemed outstanding for 
accounting purposes). For this purpose, Covenant Defeasance means that, 
with respect to all outstanding Notes and the related Guarantees, the 
Issuers and the Guarantors may omit to comply with and shall have no 
liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation set forth in any 
such covenant, whether directly or indirectly, by reason of any reference 
elsewhere herein to any such covenant or by reason of any reference in any 
such covenant to any other provision herein or in any other document and 
such omission to comply shall not constitute a Default or an Event of 
Default under Section 6.01 hereof, but, except as specified above, the 
remainder of this Indenture and such Notes and the Guarantees shall be 
unaffected thereby. In addition, upon the Issuers exercise under Section 
8.01 hereof of the option applicable to this Section 8.03 hereof, subject 
to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 8.04 hereof, 
Section 6.01(a)(iii) (solely with respect to the covenants that are 
released upon a Covenant Defeasance), 6.01(a)(iv), 6.01(a)(v), 6.01(a)(vi) 
(solely with respect to Restricted Subsidiaries (other than the Co-Issuer) 
subject thereto), 6.01(a)(vii) (solely with respect to Restricted 
Subsidiaries (other than the Co-Issuer) subject thereto) and 6.01(a)(viii) 
hereof shall not constitute Events of Default.

Section 8.04. Conditions to Legal or Covenant Defeasance. The following 
shall be the conditions to the application of either Section 8.02 or 8.03 
hereof to the outstanding Notes:

In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance with 
respect to the Notes:

(a) the Issuers must irrevocably deposit with the Trustee, in trust, for 
the benefit of the Holders of Notes, cash in U.S. dollars, U.S. Government 
Securities, or a combination thereof, in such amounts as will be 
sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent 
public accountants, to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest 
due on such Notes on the stated maturity date or on the Redemption Date, as 
the case may be, of such principal, premium, if any, or interest on such 
Notes and the Issuers must specify whether such Notes are being defeased to 
maturity or to a particular Redemption Date; provided that upon any 
redemption that requires the payment of the Applicable Premium, the amount 
deposited shall be sufficient for purposes of this Indenture to the extent 
that an amount is deposited with the Trustee equal to the Applicable 
Premium calculated as of the date of the notice of redemption, with any 
deficit as of the Redemption Date (any such amount, the Applicable Premium 
Deficit) only required to be deposited with the Trustee on or prior to the 
Redemption Date. Any Applicable Premium Deficit shall be set forth in an 
Officers Certificate delivered to the Trustee simultaneously with the 
deposit of such Applicable Premium Deficit that confirms that such 
Applicable Premium Deficit shall be applied toward such redemption;

(b) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Issuers shall have delivered to 
the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel confirming that, subject to customary 
assumptions and exclusions:

(i) the Issuers have received from, or there has been published by, the 
United States Internal Revenue Service a ruling, or

(ii) since the issuance of the Notes, there has been a change in the 
applicable U.S. federal income tax law,

in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such Opinion of 
Counsel shall confirm that, subject to customary assumptions and 
exclusions, the beneficial owners of the Notes will not recognize income, 
gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such Legal 
Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same 
amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the 
case if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred;

(c) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Issuers shall have delivered to 
the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel confirming that, subject to customary 
assumptions and exclusions, the beneficial owners of the Notes will not 
recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a 
result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal 
income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as 
would have been the case if such Covenant Defeasance had not occurred;

(d) no Event of Default (other than that resulting from borrowing funds to 
be applied to make such deposit and any similar and simultaneous deposit 
relating to other Indebtedness and, in each case, the granting of Liens in 
connection therewith) shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of 
such deposit;

(e) such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not result in a 
breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, the Senior Secured 
Credit Facilities or any other material agreement or instrument (other than 
this Indenture) to which the Issuers or any Guarantor is a party or by 
which the Issuers or any Guarantor is bound (other than that resulting from 
any borrowing of funds to be applied to make the deposit required to effect 
such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance and any similar and 
simultaneous deposit relating to other Indebtedness, and, in each case, the 
granting of Liens in connection therewith);
 
-102-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(f) the Issuers shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers 
Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuers with the 
intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding any creditors of the 
Issuers or any Guarantor or others; and

(g) the Issuers shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers 
Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which Opinion of Counsel may be 
subject to customary assumptions and exclusions) each stating that all 
conditions precedent provided for or relating to the Legal Defeasance or 
the Covenant Defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with.

Section 8.05. Deposited Money and U.S. Government Securities to be Held in 
Trust; Other Miscellaneous Provisions. Subject to Section 8.06 hereof, all 
money and U.S. Government Securities (including the proceeds thereof) 
deposited with the Trustee (or other qualifying trustee, collectively for 
purposes of this Section 8.05, the Trustee) pursuant to Section 8.04 
hereof in respect of the outstanding Notes shall be held in trust and 
applied by the Trustee, in accordance with the provisions of such Notes and 
this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any Paying Agent 
(including the Issuer or a Guarantor acting as Paying Agent) as the Trustee 
may determine, to the Holders of such Notes of all sums due and to become 
due thereon in respect of principal, premium and interest, but such money 
need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by 
law.

The Issuers shall pay and indemnify the Trustee against any tax, fee or 
other charge imposed on or assessed against the cash or U.S. Government 
Securities deposited pursuant to Section 8.04 hereof or the principal and 
interest received in respect thereof other than any such tax, fee or other 
charge which by law is for the account of the Holders of the outstanding 
Notes and the related Guarantees.

Anything in this Article 8 to the contrary notwithstanding, the Trustee 
shall deliver or pay to the Issuers from time to time upon the request of 
the Issuers any money or U.S. Government Securities held by it as provided 
in Section 8.04 hereof which, in the opinion of a nationally recognized 
firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification 
thereof delivered to the Trustee (which may be the opinion delivered under 
Section 8.04(a) hereof), are in excess of the amount thereof that would 
then be required to be deposited to effect an equivalent Legal Defeasance 
or Covenant Defeasance.

Section 8.06. Repayment to Issuers. Subject to any applicable abandoned 
property law, any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or 
then held by the Issuers, in trust for the payment of the principal of, 
premium, if any, or interest on any Note and remaining unclaimed for two 
years after such principal, and premium, if any, or interest has become due 
and payable shall be paid to the Issuers on their request or (if then held 
by the Issuers) shall be discharged from such trust; and the Holder of such 
Note shall thereafter look only to the Issuers for payment thereof, and all 
liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust 
money, and all liability of the Issuers as trustee thereof, shall thereupon 
cease.

Section 8.07. Reinstatement. If the Trustee or Paying Agent is unable to 
apply any United States dollars or U.S. Government Securities in accordance 
with Section 8.02 or 8.03 hereof, as the case may be, by reason of any 
order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, 
restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, then the Issuers 
and the Guarantors obligations under this Indenture and the Notes and the 
Guarantees shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had 
occurred pursuant to Section 8.02 or 8.03 hereof until such time as the 
Trustee or Paying Agent is permitted to apply all such money in accordance 
with Section 8.02 or 8.03 hereof, as the case may be; provided that, if the 
Issuers make any payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on 
any Notes following the reinstatement of their obligations, the Issuers 
shall be subrogated to the rights of the Holders of such Notes to receive 
such payment from the money held by the Trustee or Paying Agent.


ARTICLE 9
AMENDMENT, SUPPLEMENT AND WAIVER

Section 9.01. Without Consent of Holders. Notwithstanding Section 9.02 
hereof, the Issuers, any Guarantor (with respect to a Guarantee or this 
Indenture) and the Trustee may amend or supplement this Indenture and any 
Guarantee or Notes without the consent of any Holder:

(a) to cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect or inconsistency;

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(b) to provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of 
certificated Notes;

(c) to comply with Section 5.01 hereof;

(d) to provide for the assumption of the Issuers or any Guarantors 
obligations to the Holders;

(e) to make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits 
to the Holders or that does not materially adversely affect the legal 
rights under this Indenture of any such Holder;

(f) to add covenants for the benefit of the Holders or to surrender any 
right or power conferred upon the Issuers or any Guarantor;

(g) to provide for the issuance of Additional Notes in accordance with the 
terms of this Indenture;

(h) to comply with the requirements of the SEC in order to effect or 
maintain the qualification of this Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act;

(i) to evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under this 
Indenture of a successor Trustee or a successor Paying Agent hereunder 
pursuant to the requirements hereof;

(j) to make any amendment to the provisions of this Indenture relating to 
the transfer or legending of the Notes or to provide for the issuance of 
Exchange Notes or private exchange notes, which are identical to Exchange 
Notes except that they are not freely transferable;

(k) to add an obligor or a Guarantor under this Indenture or to release an 
obligor or a Guarantor in accordance with the terms of this Indenture;

(l) at any time following the Reset Date, if any, to conform the text of 
this Indenture, the Guarantees or the Notes to any provision of the 
Description of the Notes section of the Offering Memorandum to the extent 
that such provision in such Description of the Notes section was intended 
to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of this Indenture, Guarantee or 
Notes as provided in an Officers Certificate;

(m) to make any amendment to the provisions of this Indenture relating to 
the transfer and legending of Notes as permitted by this Indenture, 
including, without limitation to facilitate the issuance and administration 
of the Notes; provided, however, that such amendment does not materially 
and adversely affect the rights of Holders to transfer Notes;

(n) to secure the Notes and/or the related Guarantees or to add collateral 
thereto;

(o) to effect the Spin-Off Transaction and related transactions so long as 
such modification, when taken as a whole, does not materially adversely 
affect the legal rights under this Indenture of any Holder; or

(p) to make any other modifications to the Notes or the Indenture of a 
formal, minor or technical nature or necessary to correct a manifest error, 
so long as such modification does not adversely affect the rights of any 
Holders in any material respect.

Upon the request of the Issuers accompanied by a resolution of the Board of 
Directors of each Issuer authorizing the execution of any such amended or 
supplemental indenture, and upon receipt by the Trustee of the documents 
described in Section 7.02 hereof (to the extent requested by the Trustee 
and subject to the last sentence of
 
-104-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Section 9.06), the Trustee shall join with the Issuers and the Guarantors 
in the execution of any amended or supplemental indenture authorized or 
permitted by the terms of this Indenture and to make any further 
appropriate agreements and stipulations that may be therein contained, but 
the Trustee shall have the right, but not be obligated to, enter into such 
amended or supplemental indenture that affects its own rights, duties or 
immunities under this Indenture or otherwise. Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, neither an Opinion of Counsel nor an Officers Certificate, nor 
a board resolution, shall be required in connection with the addition of a 
Guarantor under this Indenture upon execution and delivery by such 
Guarantor and the Trustee of a supplemental indenture to this Indenture, 
the form of which is attached as Exhibit D hereto.

Section 9.02. With Consent of Holders. Except as provided in Section 9.01 
and this Section 9.02, the Issuers, the Guarantors and the Trustee may 
amend or supplement this Indenture, the Notes and the Guarantees with the 
consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of all 
the Notes then outstanding, including consents obtained in connection with 
a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes and, subject to 
Section 6.04 and 6.07 hereof, any existing Default or Event of Default 
(other than a Default or Event of Default in the payment of the principal 
of, premium, if any, or interest on the Notes, except a payment default 
resulting from an acceleration that has been rescinded) or compliance with 
any provision of this Indenture, the Guarantees or the Notes issued 
thereunder may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in 
principal amount of all the Notes then outstanding (including consents 
obtained in connection with a purchase of or tender offer or exchange offer 
for the Notes). Section 2.08 hereof and Section 2.09 hereof shall determine 
which Notes are considered to be outstanding for the purposes of this 
Section 9.02.

Upon the request of the Issuers accompanied by a resolution of the Board of 
Directors of each Issuer authorizing the execution of any such amended or 
supplemental indenture, and upon the filing with the Trustee of evidence 
satisfactory to the Trustee of the consent of the Holders as aforesaid, the 
Trustee shall join with the Issuers and the Guarantors in the execution of 
such amended or supplemental indenture, unless such amended or supplemental 
indenture directly affects the Trustees own rights, duties or immunities 
under this Indenture or otherwise, in which case the Trustee may in its 
discretion, but shall not be obligated to, enter into such amended or 
supplemental indenture.

It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Holders under this Section 
9.02 to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment or waiver, 
but it shall be sufficient if such consent approves the substance thereof.

After an amendment, supplement or waiver under this Section 9.02 becomes 
effective, the Issuers shall send to the Holders affected thereby a notice 
briefly describing the amendment, supplement or waiver. Any failure of the 
Issuers to send such notice, or any defect therein, shall not, however, in 
any way impair or affect the validity of any such amended or supplemental 
indenture or waiver.

Without the consent of each affected Holder, an amendment or waiver under 
this Section 9.02 may not, with respect to any Notes held by a 
non-consenting Holder:

(a) reduce the principal amount of such Notes whose Holders must consent to 
an amendment, supplement or waiver;

(b) reduce the principal of or change the fixed final maturity of any such 
Note or alter or waive the provisions with respect to the redemption of 
such Notes (other than provisions relating to (i) notice periods (to the 
extent consistent with applicable requirements of clearing and settlement 
systems) for redemption and conditions to redemption and (ii) Section 3.08, 
Section 4.10 and Section 4.14 hereof);

(c) reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest on any 
such Note;

(d) (A) waive a Default in the payment of principal of or premium, if any, 
or interest on such Notes, except a rescission of acceleration of such 
Notes by the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of all the 
Notes then outstanding, and a waiver of the payment default that resulted 
from such acceleration, or (B) waive a Default in respect of a covenant or 
provision contained in this Indenture, the Notes or any Guarantee which 
cannot be amended or modified without the consent of all affected Holders;
 
-105-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(e) make any such Note payable in money other than that stated therein;

(f) make any change in the provisions of this Indenture relating to waivers 
of past Defaults or the contractual rights of Holders to receive payments 
of principal of or premium, if any, or interest on such Notes;

(g) make any change in these amendment and waiver provisions;

(h) amend the contractual right expressly set forth in this Indenture or 
the Notes of any Holder to receive payments of principal of or premium, if 
any, or interest on such Notes or to institute suit for the enforcement of 
any payment on or with respect to such Holders Notes;

(i) make any change to or modify the ranking of such Notes that would 
adversely affect the Holders; or

(j) except as expressly permitted by this Indenture, modify the Guarantees 
of any Significant Subsidiary, or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries 
that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial 
statements for the Issuer), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary in 
any manner materially adverse to the Holders of such Notes.

Section 9.03. Compliance with Trust Indenture Act. Every amendment or 
supplement to this Indenture or the Notes shall be set forth in an amended 
or supplemental indenture that complies in all material respects with the 
Trust Indenture Act as then in effect.

Section 9.04. Revocation and Effect of Consents. Until an amendment, 
supplement or waiver becomes effective, a consent to it by a Holder is a 
continuing consent by the Holder and every subsequent Holder of a Note or 
portion of a Note that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holders 
Note, even if notation of the consent is not made on any Note. However, any 
such Holder or subsequent Holder may revoke the consent as to its Note if 
the Trustee receives written notice of revocation before the date the 
amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective. An amendment, supplement 
or waiver becomes effective in accordance with its terms and thereafter 
binds every Holder.

The Issuers may, but shall not be obligated to, fix a record date for the 
purpose of determining the Holders entitled to consent to any amendment, 
supplement, or waiver. If a record date is fixed, then, notwithstanding the 
preceding paragraph, those Persons who were Holders at such record date (or 
their duly designated proxies), and only such Persons, shall be entitled to 
consent to such amendment, supplement, or waiver or to revoke any consent 
previously given, whether or not such Persons continue to be Holders after 
such record date. No such consent shall be valid or effective for more than 
120 days after such record date unless the consent of the requisite number 
of Holders has been obtained.

Section 9.05. Notation on or Exchange of Notes. The Trustee may, at the 
direction of the Issuer, place an appropriate notation about an amendment, 
supplement or waiver on any Note thereafter authenticated. The Issuers in 
exchange for all Notes may issue and the Trustee shall, upon receipt of an 
Authentication Order, authenticate new Notes that reflect the amendment, 
supplement or waiver.

Failure to make the appropriate notation or issue a new Note shall not 
affect the validity and effect of such amendment, supplement or waiver.

Section 9.06. Trustee to Sign Amendments, etc. The Trustee shall sign any 
amendment, supplement or waiver authorized pursuant to this Article 9 if 
the amendment, supplement or waiver does not adversely affect the rights, 
duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee. The Issuers may not sign 
an amendment, supplement or waiver until the Board of Directors of each 
Issuer approve it. In executing any amendment, supplement or waiver, the 
Trustee shall be provided with, upon request, and (subject to Section 7.01 
hereof) shall be fully protected in relying upon, in addition to the 
documents required by Section 12.04 hereof, an Officers Certificate and an 
Opinion of Counsel each stating that the execution of such amended or 
supplemental indenture is authorized or permitted
 
-106-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
by this Indenture and that such amendment, supplement or waiver is the 
legal, valid and binding obligation of the Issuer and any Guarantors party 
thereto, enforceable against them in accordance with its terms, subject to 
customary exceptions, and complies with the provisions hereof (including 
Section 9.03 hereof). Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither an Opinion of 
Counsel nor an Officers Certificate, nor a board resolution, shall be 
required for the Trustee to execute any supplemental indenture to this 
Indenture, the form of which is attached as Exhibit D hereto, adding a new 
Guarantor under this Indenture.

Section 9.07. Amendments to Conform to Marketed Notes Notwithstanding 
anything herein to the contrary, if, following the Original Issue Date, in 
connection with an anticipated marketed offering of all of the then 
outstanding PHRI Notes (such marketed PHRI Notes, the Marketed Notes), 
the terms agreed to in connection with the offering of such Marketed Notes 
as set forth in the Offering Memorandum differ from the terms of the PHRI 
Notes as set forth in the PHRI Notes or in this Indenture, then (A) the 
corresponding terms applicable to the Notes shall be deemed to have been 
automatically supplemented, amended or modified as of the closing date for 
the sale of the Marketed Notes (the Reset Date), provided that the Issuer 
shall notify the Trustee of such date in advance thereof, to reflect any 
such differences without the consent of the Holders of the Notes or any 
other person (including, without limitation, the interest rate set forth in 
the PHRI Notes), and (B) the Issuer, the Guarantors and the Trustee shall, 
on or prior to the Reset Date, amend or supplement this Indenture, any 
Guarantees and the Notes with effect from the Reset Date, without the 
consent of any Holder, to conform the text of this Indenture, such 
Guarantees and the Notes to the Description of the Notes section of the 
Offering Memorandum; provided that (i) the interest rate of the Notes shall 
be reset with effect from the Reset Date to reflect the interest rate at 
which the offering price to be set forth in the Offering Memorandum would 
equal 100.000% (of the principal amount of the Marketed Notes) plus accrued 
and unpaid interest, if any, to but excluding the Reset Date, (ii) no 
additional redemption features that allow for optional redemption by the 
Issuers prior to December 1, 2021 shall be added to this Indenture or the 
Notes and (iii) the maturity date agreed to in connection with the offering 
of the Marketed Notes shall not be earlier than the maturity date then 
applicable to the Notes or later than three months after the maturity date 
then applicable to the Notes.

Upon the request of the Issuers, the Trustee shall join with the Issuers 
and the Guarantors in the execution of such amended or supplemental 
indenture, unless such amended or supplemental indenture directly affects 
the Trustees own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or 
otherwise, in which case the Trustee may in its discretion, but shall not 
be obligated to, enter into such amended or supplemental indenture.

The Issuer may, and, at the Issuers direction, the Trustee shall, exchange 
the PHRI Notes, in certificated form, for other Definitive Notes or a 
corresponding beneficial interest in one or more Global Notes issued under 
this Indenture to reflect any such change in the terms of this Indenture, 
any Guarantees or the Notes, and/or to include CUSIP numbers and ISIN 
numbers with respect to the Notes, or as may otherwise be necessary or 
appropriate to give effect to any supplement, amendment or modification of 
the terms of this Indenture, any Guarantees or the Notes pursuant to this 
Section 9.07, and if any new Notes are to be issued in exchange for Notes 
then outstanding pursuant to this Section 9.07, the Issuer shall provide an 
Authentication Order and a cancellation order to the Trustee in respect 
thereof. Failure to make the appropriate notation or issue a new Note shall 
not affect the validity and effect of any such supplement, amendment or 
modification. The Trustee shall have no obligation to obtain any CUSIP 
numbers for the Marketed Notes or to make the Marketed Notes eligible for 
DTC.


ARTICLE 10
GUARANTEES

Section 10.01. Guarantee. Subject to this Article 10, from and after the 
Original Issue Date, each of the Guarantors hereby, jointly and severally, 
irrevocably and unconditionally, guarantees, on an unsecured senior basis, 
to each Holder of a Note authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and to 
the Trustee and its successors and assigns, irrespective of the validity 
and enforceability of this Indenture, the Notes or the Obligations of the 
Issuers hereunder or thereunder, that: (a) the principal of and interest 
and premium, if any, on the Notes shall be promptly paid in full when due, 
whether at maturity, by acceleration, redemption or otherwise, and interest 
on the overdue principal of and interest on the Notes, if any, if lawful, 
and all other Obligations of the Issuers to the Holders or the Trustee 
hereunder or under the Notes shall be promptly paid in full, all in 
accordance with the terms hereof and thereof; and (b) in case of any 
extension of time of payment or renewal of any Notes or any of such other 
obligations, that same shall be promptly paid in full when due in 
accordance with the terms of the extension or renewal,
 
-107-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise. Failing payment 
when due of any amount so guaranteed for whatever reason, the Guarantors 
shall be jointly and severally obligated to pay the same promptly. Each 
Guarantor agrees that this is a guarantee of payment and not a guarantee of 
collection.

The Guarantors hereby agree that their obligations hereunder shall be 
unconditional, irrespective of the validity, regularity or enforceability 
of the Notes or this Indenture, the absence of any action to enforce the 
same, any waiver or consent by any Holder with respect to any provisions 
hereof or thereof, the recovery of any judgment against the Issuer or the 
Co-Issuer, any action to enforce the same or any other circumstance which 
might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a 
guarantor (other than payment in full of all of the Obligations of the 
Issuers hereunder or under the Notes). Each Guarantor hereby waives, to the 
fullest extent permitted by law, diligence, presentment, demand of payment, 
filing of claims with a court in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of 
the Issuer or the Co-Issuer, any right to require a proceeding first 
against the Issuers, protest, notice and all demands whatsoever and 
covenants that this Guarantee shall not be discharged except by full 
payment of the obligations contained in the Notes and this Indenture or by 
release in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture.

Each Guarantor also agrees to pay any and all costs and expenses (including 
reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by the Trustee or any Holder in 
enforcing any rights under this Section 10.01.

If any Holder or the Trustee is required by any court or otherwise to 
return to the Issuers, the Guarantors or any custodian, trustee, liquidator 
or other similar official acting in relation to either the Issuers or the 
Guarantors, then any amount paid either to the Trustee or such Holder, this 
Guarantee, to the extent theretofore discharged, shall be reinstated in 
full force and effect.

Each Guarantor agrees that it shall not be entitled to any right of 
subrogation in relation to the Holders in respect of any obligations 
guaranteed hereby until payment in full of all obligations guaranteed 
hereby. Each Guarantor further agrees that, as between the Guarantors, on 
the one hand, and the Holders and the Trustee, on the other hand, (x) the 
maturity of the obligations guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as 
provided in Article 6 hereof for the purposes of this Guarantee, 
notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such 
acceleration in respect of the obligations guaranteed hereby, and (y) in 
the event of any declaration of acceleration of such obligations as 
provided in Article 6 hereof, such obligations (whether or not due and 
payable) shall forthwith become due and payable by the Guarantors for the 
purpose of this Guarantee. The Guarantors shall have the right to seek 
contribution from any nonpaying Guarantor so long as the exercise of such 
right does not impair the rights of the Holders under the Guarantees. Each 
Guarantor that makes a payment under its Guarantee shall, to the fullest 
extent permitted by applicable law, be entitled upon payment in full of all 
guaranteed obligations under this Indenture to a contribution from each 
other Guarantor in an amount equal to such other Guarantors pro rata 
portion of such payment based on the respective net assets of all the 
Guarantors at the time of such payment determined in accordance with GAAP.

Until terminated in accordance with Section 10.06, each Guarantee shall 
remain in full force and effect and continue to be effective should any 
petition be filed by or against the Issuer or the Co-Issuer for 
liquidation, reorganization, should the Issuer or the Co-Issuer become 
insolvent or make an assignment for the benefit of creditors or should a 
receiver or trustee be appointed for all or any significant part of the 
Issuers or the Co-Issuers assets, and shall, to the fullest extent 
permitted by law, continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case 
may be, if at any time payment of the Notes are, pursuant to applicable 
law, rescinded or reduced in amount, or must otherwise be restored or 
returned by any obligee on the Notes or Guarantees, whether as a voidable 
preference, fraudulent transfer or otherwise, all as though such payment 
had not been made. In the event that any payment or any part thereof, is 
rescinded, reduced, restored or returned, the Notes shall, to the fullest 
extent permitted by law, be reinstated and deemed reduced only by such 
amount paid and not so rescinded, reduced, restored or returned.

In case any provision of any Guarantee shall be invalid, illegal or 
unenforceable, the validity, legality, and enforceability of the remaining 
provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

The Guarantee issued by any Guarantor shall be a general unsecured senior 
obligation of such Guarantor and shall be pari passu in right of payment 
with all existing and future Senior Indebtedness of such Guarantor, if any.
 
-108-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Each payment to be made by a Guarantor in respect of its Guarantee shall be 
made without set-off, counterclaim, reduction or diminution of any kind or 
nature.

Section 10.02. Limitation on Guarantor Liability. Each Guarantor, and by 
its acceptance of Notes, each Holder, hereby confirms that it is the 
intention of all such parties that the Guarantee of such Guarantor not 
constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance for purposes of Bankruptcy 
Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer 
Act or any similar federal or state law to the extent applicable to any 
Guarantee. To effectuate the foregoing intention, the Trustee, the Holders 
and the Guarantors hereby irrevocably agree that the obligations of each 
Guarantor shall be limited to the maximum amount as will, after giving 
effect to such maximum amount and all other contingent and fixed 
liabilities of such Guarantor that are relevant under such laws and after 
giving effect to any collections from, rights to receive contribution from 
or payments made by or on behalf of any other Guarantor in respect of the 
obligations of such other Guarantor under this Article 10, result in the 
obligations of such Guarantor under its Guarantee not constituting a 
fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer under applicable law or being 
void or voidable under any law relating to insolvency of debtors.

Section 10.03. Execution and Delivery. To evidence its Guarantee set forth 
in Section 10.01 hereof, each Guarantor hereby agrees that this Indenture

Each Guarantor hereby agrees that its Guarantee set forth in Section 10.01 
hereof shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding the absence of 
the endorsement of any notation of such Guarantee on the Notes.

If an officer whose signature is on this Indenture (or a supplemental 
indenture in the form of Exhibit D hereto) no longer holds that office at 
the time the Trustee authenticates a Note, the Guarantee of such Guarantor 
shall be valid nevertheless.

The delivery of any Note by the Trustee, after the authentication thereof 
hereunder, shall constitute due delivery of the Guarantee set forth in this 
Indenture on behalf of the Guarantors.

If required by Section 4.15 hereof, the Issuer shall cause any Restricted 
Subsidiary to comply with the provisions of Section 4.15 hereof and this 
Article 10, to the extent applicable.

Section 10.04. Subrogation. Each Guarantor shall be subrogated to all 
rights of Holders against the Issuers in respect of any amounts paid by any 
Guarantor pursuant to the provisions of Section 10.01 hereof; provided 
that, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, no Guarantor 
shall be entitled to enforce or receive any payments arising out of, or 
based upon, such right of subrogation until all amounts then due and 
payable by the Issuers under this Indenture or the Notes shall have been 
paid in full.

Section 10.05. Benefits Acknowledged. Each Guarantor acknowledges that it 
will receive direct and indirect benefits from the financing arrangements 
contemplated by this Indenture and that the guarantee and waivers made by 
it pursuant to its Guarantee are knowingly made in contemplation of such 
benefits.

Section 10.06. Release of Guarantees.

(a) Each Guarantee by a Subsidiary Guarantor shall be automatically and 
unconditionally released and discharged, and shall thereupon terminate and 
be of no further force and effect, and no further action by such Subsidiary 
Guarantor, the Issuers or the Trustee is required for the release of such 
Subsidiary Guarantors Guarantee, upon:

(i) (A) any sale, exchange, disposition or transfer (by merger, 
amalgamation, consolidation, dividend, distribution or otherwise) of (x) 
the Capital Stock of such Subsidiary Guarantor, after which the applicable 
Subsidiary Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary or (y) all or 
substantially all the assets of such Subsidiary Guarantor, in each case if 
such sale, exchange, disposition or transfer is made in compliance with the 
applicable provisions of this Indenture;
 
-109-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(B) the release or discharge of the guarantee by such Subsidiary Guarantor 
of Indebtedness under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, or the release 
or discharge of such other guarantee that resulted in the creation of such 
Guarantee, except a discharge or release by or as a result of payment under 
such guarantee (it being understood that a release subject to a contingent 
reinstatement will constitute a release for the purposes of this provision, 
and that if any such Guarantee is so reinstated, such Guarantee shall also 
be reinstated to the extent that such Subsidiary Guarantor would then be 
required to provide a Guarantee pursuant to Section 4.15 hereof);

Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in compliance with the applicable 
provisions of this Indenture;

Certificate of such Subsidiary Guarantor or the Issuer and an Opinion of 
Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent provided for in this

complied with. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither an Officers 
Certificate nor an Opinion of Counsel shall be required in the case of a 
merger or consolidation in accordance with clause (i)(D) of this Section 
10.06(a), provided that notice of any such merger or consolidation shall be 
provided to the Trustee.

(b) Each Parent Guarantee shall be automatically and unconditionally 
released and discharged, and shall thereupon terminate and be of no further 
force and effect, and no further action by the Parent Guarantors, the 
Issuers or the Trustee is required for the release of such Guarantee, upon:

(i) (A) except with respect to the Parent Guarantee provided by HGV Parent, 
the release or discharge of the guarantee by such Parent Guarantor of 
Indebtedness under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities (it being 
understood that a release subject to a contingent reinstatement will 
constitute a release for the purposes of this provision); or

(B) the exercise by the Issuers of their Legal Defeasance option or 
Covenant Defeasance option in accordance with Article 8 hereof or the 
discharge of the Issuers obligations under this Indenture in accordance 
with the terms of this Indenture; and

ARTICLE 11
SATISFACTION AND DISCHARGE

Section 11.01. Satisfaction and Discharge. This Indenture shall be 
discharged and shall cease to be of further effect as to all Notes when 
either:

(a) all Notes theretofore authenticated and delivered, except lost, stolen 
or destroyed Notes which have been replaced or paid and Notes for whose 
payment money has theretofore been deposited in trust, have been delivered 
to the Trustee for cancellation; or
 
-110-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(b) (i) all Notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation 
have become due and payable by reason of the making of a notice of 
redemption or otherwise, will become due and payable within one year or are 
to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory 
to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the 
name, and at the expense, of the Issuers, and the Issuers have or any 
Guarantor has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the 
Trustee as trust funds in trust solely for the benefit of the Holders of 
the Notes cash in U.S. dollars, U.S. Government Securities, or a 
combination thereof, in such amounts as will be sufficient without 
consideration of any reinvestment of interest to pay and discharge the 
entire indebtedness on the Notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee 
for cancellation for principal, premium, if any, and accrued interest to 
the date of maturity or redemption; provided that upon any redemption that 
requires the payment of the Applicable Premium, the amount deposited shall 
be sufficient for purposes of this Indenture to the extent that an amount 
is deposited with the Trustee equal to the Applicable Premium calculated as 
of the date of the notice of redemption, with any Applicable Premium 
Deficit only required to be deposited with the Trustee on or prior to the 
Redemption Date. Any Applicable Premium Deficit shall be set forth in an 
Officers Certificate delivered to the Trustee simultaneously with the 
deposit of such Applicable Premium Deficit that confirms that such 
Applicable Premium Deficit shall be applied toward such redemption;

(ii) no Event of Default (other than that resulting from borrowing funds to 
be applied to make such deposit or any similar and simultaneous deposit 
relating to other Indebtedness and, in each case, the granting of Liens in 
connection therewith) with respect to this Indenture or the Notes shall 
have occurred and be continuing on the date of such deposit or shall occur 
as a result of such deposit and such deposit will not result in a breach or 
violation of, or constitute a default under the Senior Secured Credit 
Facilities or any other material agreement or instrument (other than this 
Indenture) to which the Issuers or any Guarantor is a party or by which the 
Issuers or any Guarantor is bound (other than resulting from any borrowing 
of funds to be applied to make such deposit and any similar and 
simultaneous deposit relating to other Indebtedness and, in each case, the 
granting of Liens in connection therewith);

(iii) the Issuers have paid or caused to be paid all sums payable by them 
under this Indenture; and

(iv) the Issuers have delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee to 
apply the deposited money toward the payment of the Notes at maturity or 
the Redemption Date, as the case may be.

In addition, the Issuers must deliver an Officers Certificate and an 
Opinion of Counsel to the Trustee stating that all conditions precedent to 
satisfaction and discharge have been satisfied. Such Opinion of Counsel may 
rely on such Officers Certificate as to matters of fact, including clauses 
(b)(i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) of this Section 11.01.

Notwithstanding the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, if money 
shall have been deposited with the Trustee pursuant to clause (b)(i) of 
this Section 11.01, the provisions of Section 11.02 and Section 8.06 hereof 
shall survive such satisfaction and discharge.

Section 11.02. Application of Trust Money. Subject to the provisions of 
Section 8.06 hereof, all money deposited with the Trustee pursuant to 
Section 11.01 hereof shall be held in trust and applied by it, in 
accordance with the provisions of the Notes and this Indenture, to the 
payment, either directly or through any Paying Agent (including the Issuer, 
the Co-Issuer or a Guarantor acting as its own Paying Agent) as the Trustee 
may determine, to the Persons entitled thereto, of the principal (and 
premium, if any) and interest for whose payment such money has been 
deposited with the Trustee; but such money need not be segregated from 
other funds except to the extent required by law.

If the Trustee or Paying Agent is unable to apply any money or U.S. 
Government Securities in accordance with Section 11.01 hereof by reason of 
any legal proceeding or by reason of any order or judgment of any court or 
governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such 
application, the Issuers and any Guarantors obligations under this 
Indenture and the Notes shall be revived and reinstated as though no 
deposit had occurred pursuant to Section 11.01 hereof; provided that if the 
Issuers have made any payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest 
on any Notes because of the reinstatement of its obligations, the Issuers 
shall be subrogated to the rights of the Holders to receive such payment 
from the money or U.S. Government Securities held by the Trustee or Paying 
Agent.

Capitalized terms used herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in 
the Indenture referred to below unless otherwise indicated.

1. Interest. Hilton Grand Vacations Borrower LLC, a Delaware limited

a Delaware corporation (the Co-Issuer and, together with the Issuer, the 
Issuers), jointly and severally, promise to pay interest on the principal 
amount of this Note at a rate per annum of 6.500% (subject to any reset 
pursuant to paragraph 4 below) from October 24, 2016 until maturity and to 
pay the Additional Interest, if any, payable pursuant to the Registration 
Rights Agreement expected to be entered into on the Reset Date (as defined 
below). The Issuers will pay interest on this Note semi-annually in arrears 
beginning on the Reset Date (the Initial Interest Payment Date) and on 
June 1 and December 1 of each year thereafter, or, if any such day is not a 
Business Day, on the next succeeding Business Day (each an Interest 
Payment Date). The Issuers will make each interest payment to the Holder 
of record of this Note on the immediately preceding May 15 and November 15 
(or, in the case of the Initial Interest Payment Date, the calendar day 
immediately preceding the Reset Date) (each, a Record Date). Interest on 
this Note will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been 
paid or, if no interest has been paid, from and including October 24, 2016. 
The Issuers will pay interest (including post-petition interest in any 
proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law) on overdue principal and premium, if 
any, from time to time on demand at the rate borne by this Note; the 
Issuers shall pay interest (including post-petition interest in any 
proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law) on overdue installments of interest 
(without regard to any applicable grace periods) from time to time on 
demand at the rate borne by this Note. Interest will be computed on the 
basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months.

2. Method of Payment. The Issuers will pay interest on this Note to the 
Person who is the registered Holder of this Note at the close of business 
on the Record Date (whether or not a Business Day) next preceding the 
Interest Payment Date, even if this Note is cancelled after such Record 
Date and on or before such Interest Payment Date, except as provided in 
Section 2.12 of the Indenture with respect to defaulted interest. Cash 
payments of principal of, premium, if any, and interest on this Note will 
be payable at the office or agency of the Issuers maintained for such 
purpose pursuant to Section 4.02 of the Indenture or, at the option of the 
Issuers, cash payment of interest may be made through the Paying Agent by 
check mailed to the Holders at their respective addresses set forth in the 
Note Register of Holders, provided that (a) all cash payments of principal, 
premium, if any, and interest with respect to Notes represented by Global 
Notes registered in the name of or held by DTC or its nominee will be made 
through the Paying Agent by wire transfer of immediately available funds to 
the accounts specified by the registered Holder or Holders thereof and (b) 
all cash payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest with respect 
to certificated Notes may, at the option of the Issuers, be made by wire 
transfer to a U.S. dollar account maintained by the payee with a bank in 
the United States of America if such Holder elects payment by wire transfer 
by giving written notice to the Trustee or the Paying Agent to such effect 
designating such account no later than 30 days immediately preceding the 
relevant due date for payment (or such other date as the Trustee may accept 
in its discretion). Such payment shall be in such coin or currency of the 
United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for 
payment of public and private debts.

3. Paying Agent, Transfer Agent and Registrar. Initially, Wilmington Trust, 
National Association, the Trustee under the Indenture, will act as Paying 
Agent, Transfer Agent and Registrar. The Issuers may change any Paying 
Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar without prior notice to the Holders. The 
Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries may act in any such capacity upon written 
notice to the Trustee.

4. Indenture. The Issuers issued the Notes under an Indenture, dated as of 
October 24, 2016 (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time 
to time, the Indenture), among the Issuers, the Guarantors from time to 
time party thereto and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee 
(the Trustee). This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of notes of 
the Issuer designated as its 6.500% Senior Notes due 2024. The Issuers 
shall be entitled to issue Additional Notes pursuant to Sections 2.01 and 
4.09 of the Indenture. The terms of this Note include those stated in the 
Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust 
Indenture Act. This Note is subject to all such terms, and the Holder of 
this Note is referred to the Indenture and the Trust Indenture Act for a 
statement of such terms. To the extent any provision of this Note conflicts 
with the express provisions of the Indenture, the provisions of the 
Indenture shall govern and be controlling.

5. Optional Redemption.

and on one or more occasions, redeem all or a part of the Notes, upon 
notice in accordance with Section 3.03 of the Indenture, at a redemption

set forth below, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Interest, 
if any, thereon to, but excluding, the applicable Redemption Date, subject 
to the right of Holders of record on the relevant Record Date to receive

not withdraw such Notes in such tender offer and the Issuers, or any third 
party making such tender offer in lieu of the Issuers, purchases all of the 
Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuers or 
such third party will have the right upon not less than 15 nor more than 60 
days prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such purchase 
date, to redeem all Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase 
at a price equal to the price offered to each other Holder in such tender 
offer plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer payment, accrued 
and unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to, but excluding, the Redemption 
Date.

(e) Any redemption pursuant to this paragraph 5 shall be made pursuant to 
the provisions of Sections 3.01 through 3.06 of the Indenture. Notice of 
any redemption may be given prior to the completion thereof, and any such 
redemption or notice may, at the Issuers discretion, be subject to one or 
more conditions precedent, including, but not limited to, completion of a 
related transaction. In addition, if such redemption is subject to 
satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice shall state 
that, in the Issuers discretion, the Redemption Date may be delayed until 
such time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied, or such 
redemption may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that 
any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied by the Redemption 
Date, or by the Redemption Date so delayed. In addition, the Issuers may 
provide in such notice that payment of the redemption price and performance 
of the Issuers obligations with respect to such redemption may be 
performed by another Person. The Issuers, the Investors and their 
respective Affiliates may acquire the Notes by means other than a

market purchases, negotiated transactions or otherwise.

more than 60 days before the Redemption Date to each Holder whose Notes are 
to be redeemed at such Holders registered address or otherwise in 
accordance with the Applicable Procedures, except that redemption notices 
may be delivered electronically or mailed more than 60
 
A-1-5

Article 8 or Article 11 of the Indenture. Notes and portions of Notes 
selected for redemption shall be in integral multiples of $1,000 (but in a 
minimum amount of $2,000) and no Notes of $2,000 or less can be redeemed in 
part, except that if all of the Notes of a Holder are to be redeemed, the 
entire outstanding amount of Notes held by such Holder shall be redeemed, 
even if not in a principal amount of at least $2,000. On and after the 
Redemption Date, subject to satisfaction of any conditions precedent 
specified in the applicable notice of redemption, interest ceases to accrue 
on this Note or portions thereof called for redemption.

7. Offers to Repurchase. Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control 
Triggering Event, the Issuers shall make a Change of Control Offer in 
accordance with Section 4.14 of the Indenture. In connection with certain 
Asset Sales, the Issuers shall make an Asset Sale Offer as and when 
provided in accordance with Sections 3.09 and 4.10 of the Indenture.

The Registrar and the Trustee may require a Holder, among other things, to 
furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents and the Issuers may 
require a Holder to pay any taxes and fees required by law or permitted by 
the Indenture. The Issuers need not exchange or register the transfer of 
any Note or portion of a Note selected for redemption, except for the 
unredeemed portion of any Note being redeemed in part; provided that new 
Notes will only be issued in minimum denominations of $2,000 and integral 
multiples of $1,000 in excess of $2,000. Also, the Issuers need not 
exchange or register the transfer of any Notes for a period of 15 days 
before the mailing of a notice of redemption of Notes to be redeemed.

9. Persons Deemed Owners. The registered Holder of a Note shall be treated 
as its owner for all purposes. Only registered Holders shall have rights 
hereunder.

10. Amendment, Supplement and Waiver. The Indenture, the Guarantees or the 
Notes may be amended or supplemented as provided in the Indenture.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if, following the date 
hereof, in connection with an anticipated marketed offering of all of the 
then outstanding PHRI Notes (such marketed PHRI Notes, the Marketed Notes
), the terms agreed to in connection with the offering of such Marketed 
Notes, as set forth in the final offering memorandum relating thereto (the 
Offering Memorandum), differ from the terms of this Note as set forth 
herein or in the Indenture, then (a) the corresponding terms of this Note 
as set forth herein or in the Indenture shall be deemed to have been 
automatically supplemented, amended or modified as of the closing date for 
the sale of the Marketed Notes pursuant to the Purchase Agreement (the 
Reset Date) to reflect any such differences without the consent of the 
Holder of this Note or any other person (including, without limitation, the 
interest rate set forth in paragraph 1 of this Note), and (b) the Issuer, 
the Guarantors and the Trustee shall, on or prior to the Reset Date, amend 
or supplement the Indenture, any Guarantees and the Notes with effect from 
the Reset Date, pursuant to Section 9.07 of the Indenture without the 
consent of any Holder, to conform the text of the Indenture, such 
Guarantees and the Notes to the Description of the Notes section of the 
Offering Memorandum; provided that (i) the interest rate of this Note shall 
be reset with effect from the Reset Date to reflect the interest rate at 
which the offering price to be set forth in the Offering Memorandum would 
equal 100.000% (of the principal amount of the Marketed Notes) plus accrued 
and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the Reset Date, (ii) no 
additional redemption features that allow for optional redemption by the 
Issuers prior to December 1, 2021shall be added to this Note or the 
Indenture and (iii) the maturity date agreed to in connection with the 
offering of the Marketed Notes shall not be earlier than the maturity date 
set forth in this Note or later than three months after the maturity date 
set forth in this Note. The Issuer may, and, at the Issuers direction, the 
Trustee shall, exchange this Note, in certificated form, for another 
Definitive Note or a corresponding beneficial interest in one or more 
Global Notes issued under the Indenture to reflect any such change in the 
terms of the Indenture, any Guarantees or this Note, and/or to include 
CUSIP numbers and
 
A-1-6

------------------------------------------------------------------------
ISIN numbers with respect to the Notes, or as may otherwise be necessary or 
appropriate to give effect to any supplement, amendment or modification of 
the terms of the Indenture, any Guarantees or this Note pursuant to this 
paragraph and Section 9.07 of the Indenture, and if any new Notes are to be 
issued in exchange for this Note pursuant to this paragraph and Section 
9.07 of the Indenture, the Issuer shall provide an Authentication Order and 
a cancellation order to the Trustee in respect thereof. Failure to make the 
appropriate notation or issue a new Note shall not affect the validity and 
effect of any such supplement, amendment or modification.

11. Defaults and Remedies.

(a) The Events of Default relating to the Notes are defined in Section 6.01 
of the Indenture. If any Event of Default (other than an Event of Default 
of the type specified in clause (vi) or (vii) of Section 6.01(a) of the 
Indenture) occurs and is continuing under the Indenture, the Trustee or the 
Holders of not less than 25.0% in aggregate principal amount of all of the 
then outstanding Notes may, by notice to the Issuers and the Trustee, in 
either case, specifying in such notice the respective Event of Default and 
that such notice is a notice of acceleration, declare the principal, 
premium, if any, interest and any other monetary obligations on all the 
then outstanding Notes to be due and payable immediately. Upon the 
effectiveness of such declaration, such principal of and premium, if any, 
and interest will be due and payable immediately. Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, in the case of an Event of Default arising under clause (vi) or 
(vii) of Section 6.01(a) of the Indenture, all outstanding Notes will 
become due and payable without further action or notice. Holders may not 
enforce the Indenture, the Notes or the Guarantees except as provided in 
the Indenture. Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in 
aggregate principal amount of all the Notes then outstanding may direct the 
Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power.

(b) The Trustee may withhold from the Holders notice of any continuing 
Default, except a Default relating to the payment of principal, premium, if 
any, or interest, if it determines that withholding notice is in their 
interest. In addition, subject to Section 6.05 of the Indenture, the 
Trustee will have no obligation to accelerate the Notes if in the judgment 
of the Trustee acceleration is not in the interests of the Holders of all 
of the Notes.

(c) Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of all the Notes 
then outstanding, by notice to the Trustee (with a copy to the Issuers, 
provided that any waiver or rescission under Section 6.04 of the Indenture 
shall be valid and binding notwithstanding the failure to provide a copy of 
such notice to the Issuers) may on behalf of the Holders of all of the 
Notes waive any existing Default and its consequences under the Indenture 
(except a continuing Default in the payment of interest on, premium, if 
any, or the principal of any Note held by a non-consenting Holder) 
(including in connection with an Asset Sale Offer or a Change of Control 
Offer) and rescind any acceleration with respect to the Notes and its 
consequences under the Indenture (except if such rescission would conflict 
with any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction). Upon any such 
waiver, such Default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising 
therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured for every purpose of the 
Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other 
Default or impair any right consequent thereto.

(d) The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement 
regarding compliance with the Indenture, and the Issuer shall promptly 
(which shall be no more than 20 Business Days after becoming aware of such 
Default) deliver to the Trustee by registered or certified mail or by 
facsimile transmission an Officers Certificate specifying such event and 
what action the Issuers propose to take with respect thereto.

12. Guarantees. The Issuers obligations under the Notes will be fully and 
unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by the Guarantors from 
time to time party to the Indenture.

13. Authentication. This Note shall not be entitled to any benefit under 
the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose until authenticated 
by the manual signature of the Trustee.

14. Governing Law. THIS NOTE, AND ANY CLAIM, CONTROVERSY OR DISPUTE ARISING 
UNDER OR RELATED TO THIS NOTE, WILL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN 
ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

15. CUSIP Numbers and ISINs. The Issuers may use CUSIP numbers and ISINs 
(in each case, if then generally in use). The Issuers will as promptly as 
practicable notify the Holders in writing of any change in the
 
A-1-7

------------------------------------------------------------------------
CUSIP numbers and ISINs. No representation will be made as to the accuracy 
of such numbers either as printed on the Notes or as contained in any 
notice of redemption and reliance may be placed only on the other 
identification numbers placed thereon.

The Issuers will furnish to any Holder upon written request and without 
charge a copy of the Indenture. Requests may be made to the Issuers at the

Indenture) occurs and is continuing under the Indenture, the Trustee or the 
Holders of not less than 25.0% in aggregate principal amount of all of the 
then outstanding Notes may, by notice to the Issuers and the Trustee, in 
either case, specifying in such notice the respective Event of Default and 
that such notice is a notice of acceleration, declare the principal, 
premium, if any, interest and any other monetary obligations on all the 
then outstanding Notes to be due and payable immediately. Upon the 
effectiveness of such declaration, such principal of and premium, if any, 
and interest will be due and payable immediately. Notwithstanding the

A-2-7

------------------------------------------------------------------------
without further action or notice. Holders may not enforce the Indenture, 
the Notes or the Guarantees except as provided in the Indenture. Subject to 
certain limitations, Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of 
all the Notes then outstanding may direct the Trustee in its exercise of 
any trust or power.

(b) The Trustee may withhold from the Holders notice of any continuing 
Default, except a Default relating to the payment of principal, premium, if 
any, or interest, if it determines that withholding notice is in their 
interest. In addition, subject to Section 6.05 of the Indenture, the 
Trustee will have no obligation to accelerate the Notes if in the judgment 
of the Trustee acceleration is not in the interests of the Holders of all 
of the Notes.

(c) Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of all the Notes 
then outstanding, by notice to the Trustee (with a copy to the Issuers, 
provided that any waiver or rescission under Section 6.04 of the Indenture 
shall be valid and binding notwithstanding the failure to provide a copy of 
such notice to the Issuers) may on behalf of the Holders of all of the 
Notes waive any existing Default and its consequences under the Indenture 
(except a continuing Default in the payment of interest on, premium, if 
any, or the principal of any Note held by a non-consenting Holder) 
(including in connection with an Asset Sale Offer or a Change of Control 
Offer) and rescind any acceleration with respect to the Notes and its 
consequences under the Indenture (except if such rescission would conflict 
with any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction). Upon any such 
waiver, such Default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising 
therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured for every purpose of the 
Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other 
Default or impair any right consequent thereto.

(d) The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement 
regarding compliance with the Indenture, and the Issuer shall promptly 
(which shall be no more than 20 Business Days after becoming aware of such 
Default) deliver to the Trustee by registered or certified mail or by 
facsimile transmission an Officers Certificate specifying such event and 
what action the Issuers propose to take with respect thereto.

unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by the Guarantors from 
time to time party to the Indenture.

the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose until authenticated 
by the manual signature of the Trustee.

14. Additional Rights of Holders of Restricted Global Notes and Restricted 
Definitive Notes. In addition to the rights provided to Holders under the 
Indenture, Holders of Restricted Global Notes and Restricted Definitive 
Notes shall have all the rights set forth in the Registration Rights

UNDER OR RELATED TO THIS NOTE, WILL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN 
ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

caused CUSIP numbers and ISINs to be printed on the Notes and the Trustee 
may use CUSIP numbers and ISINs in notices of redemption as a convenience 
to Holders.
