    1.5       Special Provisions Relating to Pledged Investment Property


       (a)       Until demand is made for repayment under the Note, the
       Corporation has the right to exercise all voting, consensual and
       other powers of ownership pertaining to Collateral which is
       investment property (the Pledged Investment Property) for all
       purposes not inconsistent with the terms of this security agreement,
       the Note or the other Credit Documents and the Corporation agrees
       that it will not vote the Pledged Investment Property in any manner
       that is inconsistent with such terms.


       (b)       Until demand is made for repayment under the Note, the
       Corporation may receive and retain any dividends, distributions or
       proceeds on the Pledged Investment Property.


       (c)       If demand is made for repayment under the Note, whether or
       not the Lender exercises any right to declare any Obligations due
       and payable or seeks or pursues any other relief or remedy available
       to it under applicable law or under this security agreement or
       otherwise, all dividends and other distributions on the Pledged
       Investment Property shall be paid directly to the Lender and
       retained by it as part of the Collateral, and, if the Lender so
       requests in writing, the Corporation will execute and deliver to the
       Lender any instruments or other documents necessary or desirable to
       ensure that the Pledged Investment Property is paid directly to the
       Lender.


    1.6       Scope of Security Interest


       (a)       The Security Interest with respect to the trade-marks
       constitutes a security interest in, and a charge, hypothecation and
       pledge of, such Collateral in favour of the Lender, but does not
       constitute an assignment or mortgage of such Collateral to the
       Lender.  Until the Security Interest becomes enforceable, the grant
       of the Security Interest in the Intellectual Property will not
       affect in any way the Corporations rights to commercially exploit
       it or defend or enforce the Corporations rights in it or with
       respect to it.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
       (b)       The Security Interest does not extend to consumer goods.


       (c)       The Security Interest does not extend or apply to the last
       day of the term of any lease or sublease or any agreement for a
       lease or sublease, now held or hereafter acquired by the Corporation
       in respect of real property, but the Corporation shall stand
       possessed of any such last day upon trust to assign and dispose of
       it as the Lender may direct.


    1.7       Care and Custody of Collateral


       (a)       The Lender has no obligation to keep Collateral in its
       possession identifiable.


       (b)       The Lender shall exercise in the physical keeping of any
       Negotiable Collateral or securities, only the same degree of care as
       it would exercise in respect of its own such property kept at the
       same place.


       (c)       The Lender may, both before and after the Security
       Interest has become enforceable, (i) notify any person obligated on
       an account, chattel paper or instrument to make payments to the
       Lender whether or not the Corporation was previously making
       collections on such accounts, chattel paper or instruments, and (ii)
       assume control of any proceeds arising from the Collateral.


    1.8       Amalgamation


      In the event the Corporation amalgamates with any other corporation
      or corporations, it is the intention of the parties that the Security
      Interest will (a) extend to all of the property and assets that (i)
      any of the amalgamating corporations own, or (ii) the amalgamated
      corporation thereafter acquires, and (b) secure the payment and
      performance of all debts, liabilities and obligations, present or
      future, direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, matured or
      unmatured, at any time or from time to time due or accruing due and
      owing by or otherwise payable by any of the amalgamating corporations
      and the amalgamated corporation to the Lender in any currency 
      pursuant to or in connection with the Note and the other Credit
      Documents whether incurred prior to, or at the time of, or subsequent
      to, any amalgamation.  The Security Interest will attach to the
      property and assets of the amalgamating corporations not previously
      subject to this security agreement at the time of amalgamation and to
      any property or assets thereafter owned or acquired by the
      amalgamated corporation when same becomes owned or is acquired.  Upon
      any such amalgamation, the defined term Corporation means,
      collectively, each of the amalgamating corporations and the
      amalgamated corporation, the defined term Collateral means all of the
      property, assets, undertaking and interests described in (a) above,
      and the defined term Obligations means the obligations described in
      (b) above.


Article 2
Enforcement
    2.1       Enforcement


      The Security Interest shall be and become enforceable against the
      Corporation if and when it fails to repay or perform any of the

      be.

      in its sole discretion, either directly or through its agents or
      nominees, whenever the Security Interest has become enforceable:


       (a)       require the Corporation, at the Corporations expense, to

       writing and the Corporation agrees to so assemble the Collateral;

       person with respect to such holding, retention or disposition,
       except as required by law.


    2.4       Concerning a Receiver


       (a)       Any receiver appointed by the Lender shall be vested with
       all rights and remedies which could have been exercised by the
       Lender in respect of the Corporation or the Collateral and such
       other powers and discretions as are granted in the instrument of
       appointment and any supplemental instruments.  The choice of
       receiver and its remuneration are within the sole and unfettered
       discretion of the Lender.


       (b)       Any receiver appointed by the Lender shall act as agent
       for the Lender for the purposes of taking possession of the
       Collateral, but otherwise and for all other purposes (except as
       provided below), as agent for the Corporation.  The receiver may
       sell, lease, or otherwise dispose of Collateral as agent for the
       Corporation or as agent for the Lender as the Lender may determine
       in its discretion.  The Corporation agrees to ratify and confirm all
       actions of the receiver acting as agent for the Corporation, and to
       release and indemnify the receiver in respect of all such actions.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
       (c)       The Lender, in appointing or refraining from appointing
       any receiver, shall not incur any liability to the receiver, the
       Corporation or otherwise and is not responsible for any misconduct
       or negligence of such receiver.


    2.5       Exercise of Remedies


      Any remedy may be exercised separately or in combination and is in
      addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights or
      remedies the Lender may have, however created.  The Lender is not
      bound to exercise any right or remedy, and the exercise of rights and
      remedies is without prejudice to any other rights of the Lender in
      respect of the Obligations including the right to claim for any
      deficiency.


    2.6       Appointment of Attorney


      The Corporation irrevocably appoints the Lender (and its officers) as
      attorney of the Corporation (with full power of substitution) to do,
      make and execute, in the name of and on behalf of the Corporation,
      all such further acts, documents, matters and things which the Lender
      may deem necessary or advisable to accomplish the purposes of this
      security agreement including the execution, endorsement and delivery
      of documents and any notices, receipts, assignments or verifications
      of the accounts.  All acts of the attorney are hereby ratified and
      approved, and the attorney shall not be liable for any act, failure
      to act or any other matter or thing, except to the extent caused by
      its own gross negligence or wilful misconduct.  This power of
      attorney is irrevocable, is coupled with an interest, has been given
      for valuable consideration (the receipt and adequacy of which is
      acknowledged) and survives, and does not terminate upon, the
      bankruptcy, dissolution, winding up or insolvency of the Corporation.
       This power of attorney extends to and is binding upon the
      Corporations successors and permitted assigns.  The Corporation
      authorizes the Lender to (a) delegate in writing to another person
      any power and authority of the Corporation under this power of
      attorney as may be necessary or desirable in the opinion of the
      Lender, and (b) revoke or suspend such delegation.


    2.7       Dealing with the Collateral


       (a)       The Lender is not obliged to exhaust its recourse against
       the Corporation or any other person or against any other security it
       may hold in respect of the Obligations before realizing upon or
       otherwise dealing with the Collateral in such manner as the Lender
       considers desirable.


       (b)      The Lender may grant extensions or other indulgences, take
       and give up security, accept compositions, grant releases and
       discharges and otherwise deal with the Corporation and with other
       persons, guarantors, sureties or security as it may see fit without
       prejudice to the Obligations, the liability of the Corporation or
       the rights of the Lender in respect of the Collateral.


       (c)       The Lender is not (i) liable or accountable for any
       failure to collect, realize or obtain payment in respect of the
       Collateral, (ii) bound to institute proceedings for the purpose of
       collecting, enforcing, realizing or obtaining payment of the
       Collateral or for the purpose of preserving any rights of any
       persons in respect of the Collateral, (iii) responsible for any loss
       occasioned by any sale or other dealing with the Collateral or by
       the retention of or failure to sell or otherwise deal with the
       Collateral, or (iv) bound to protect the Collateral from
       depreciating in value or becoming worthless.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
       (d)      To the extent that applicable law imposes duties on the
       Lender to exercise remedies in a commercially reasonable manner, and
       without prejudice to the ability of the Lender to dispose of the
       Collateral in any such manner, the Corporation acknowledges and
       agrees that it is not commercially unreasonable for the Lender to,
       and the Lender may, in its discretion (i) incur expenses reasonably
       deemed significant by the Lender to prepare the Collateral for
       disposition, (ii) exercise collection remedies directly or through
       the use of collection agencies, (iii) dispose of Collateral by way
       of public auction, public tender or private contract, with or
       without advertising and without any other formality, (iv) dispose of
       Collateral to the Lender or to a customer or client of the Lender,
       (v) contact other persons, whether or not in the same business as
       the Corporation, for expressions of interest in acquiring all or any
       portion of the Collateral, (vi) hire one or more professional
       auctioneers to assist in the disposition of the Collateral, whether
       or not the Collateral is of a specialized nature, (vii) establish an
       upset or reserve bid or price in respect of the Collateral, and
       (viii) establish such terms as to credit or otherwise as the Lender
       may determine.


       (e)       The Corporation acknowledges that the Lender may be unable
       to complete a public sale of any or all of the Collateral consisting
       of investment property by reason of certain prohibitions contained
       in applicable securities laws or otherwise.  In connection
       therewith, it may be compelled to resort to one or more private
       sales to a restricted group of purchasers who will be obliged to
       agree, among other things, to acquire the Collateral for their own
       account for investment and not with a  view to the distribution or
       resale thereof.  Any such private sale may result in prices and
       other terms less favourable to the seller than if such sale were a
       public sale and, notwithstanding such circumstances, the Corporation
       agrees that any such private sale shall not be deemed to have been
       made in a commercially unreasonable manner by reason of it being a
       private sale.  The Lender is under no obligation to delay a sale of
       any or all of the Collateral for the period of time necessary to
       permit the issuer thereof to register such Collateral for public
       sale under applicable securities law or otherwise, even if the
       issuer agrees to do so.


    2.8       Application of Proceeds


      Any and all moneys realized by the Lender pursuant to this security
      agreement shall be applied by the Lender to such part of to the
      Obligations as the Lender in its sole discretion determines.  The
      Lender may, at all times and from time to time, change any
      application so made in accordance with the Note and the other Credit
      Documents.


    2.9       No Waiver


      No delay or omission by the Lender, at any time or times, to require
      strict performance by the Corporation of any provision of this
      security agreement waives, affects or diminishes any right of the
      Lender thereafter to demand strict compliance and performance
      therewith.

    2.10     Dealings by Third Parties


       (a)       No person dealing with the Lender, or an agent  or
       receiver is required to determine (i) whether the Security Interest
       has become enforceable, (ii) whether the powers which such person is
       purporting to exercise have become exercisable, (iii) whether any
       money remains due to the Lender by the Corporation, (iv) the
       necessity or expediency of the stipulations and conditions subject
       to which any sale or lease is made, (v) the propriety or regularity
       of any sale or other dealing by the Lender or any agent with the
       Collateral, or (vi) how any money paid to the Lender has been
       applied.


       (b)       Any purchaser of Collateral shall hold the Collateral
       absolutely, free from any claim or right of any kind whatever,
       including any equity of redemption, of the Corporation.  The
       Corporation waives (to the fullest extent permitted by law) as
       against any such purchaser, all rights of redemption, stay or
       appraisal which the Corporation has or may have under any rule of
       law or statute now existing or hereafter adopted.


    2.11     Corporation Liable for Deficiency


      The Corporation is liable to the Lender for any deficiency after the
      proceeds of any sale or other disposition of Collateral are received
      by the Lender.

       (a)       Capitalized terms used in this security agreement and not
       otherwise defined have the respective meanings given to them in the
       Note.


       (b)       Any reference to this security agreement, the Note or any
       other Credit Document refers to this security agreement or such Note

       or supplemented.


    3.3       Discharge


      The Security Interest will be discharged upon, but only upon, (a)
      full and indefeasible payment and performance of the Obligations, (b)
      the Lender having no obligations under the Note and the other Credit
      Documents, and (c) at the request and expense of the Corporation.  In
      that connection, the Lender will execute and deliver to the
      Corporation such releases and discharges as the Corporation may
      reasonably require.

      This security agreement may only be amended, supplemented or
      otherwise modified by written agreement of the Lender and the
      Corporation.


    3.5       Waivers, etc.


       (a)       No consent or waiver by the Lender in connection with this
       security agreement is binding unless made in writing and signed by
       an authorized officer of the Lender.  Any consent or waiver given
       under this security agreement is effective only in the specific
       instance and for the specific purpose for which it was given.  No

       arising.  A single or partial exercise of a right or remedy on the
       part of the Lender does not preclude any other or further exercise

       remedies by the Lender.

      security now or hereafter held by the Lender in respect of the
      Obligations.

      and agreements as the Lender may reasonably require for (a)
      protecting the Collateral, (b) perfecting the Security Interest, (c)
      obtaining control of the Collateral, (d) exercising all powers,
      authorities and discretions conferred upon the Lender, and (e)
      otherwise enabling the Lender to obtain the full benefits of this
      security agreement and the rights and powers herein granted.  The

      Corporation, and in any action brought by an assignee to enforce this
      security agreement or any right or remedy, the Corporation will not
      assert against the assignee any claim or defence which the
      Corporation now has or hereafter may have against the Lender. 
      Neither this security agreement nor any rights, duties or obligations
      under this security agreement are assignable or transferable by the
      Corporation.

      right to receive a copy of any financing statement or financing
      change statement registered by or on behalf of the Lender, or any

       submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Ontario,
       (ii) agrees that all claims in respect of any suit, action or
       proceeding may be heard and determined in such court, and (iii)
       waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which
