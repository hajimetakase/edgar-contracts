Seller or its Affiliates who are engaged from time to time in compliance 
with Section 5.5 of this Agreement.
 
Section 5.3            Further Assurances; Consents.
 
(a)           Prior to Closing, each Party shall use commercially

reasonable efforts to obtain such consent promptly after the Closing, and

asset owned or licensed by Seller that was material to the MedLaunch

transferred to Buyer at Closing as part of the Purchased Assets and 
notifies Seller in writing of the existence of such Omitted Asset and 
Buyers belief that such Omitted Asset constitutes a Purchased Asset, 
Seller shall cooperate in good faith with Buyer to determine whether such 
Omitted Asset should have been transferred to Buyer as a Purchased Asset, 
and if Seller agrees that such Omitted Asset should have been transferred 
to Buyer at Closing, Seller shall either (i) transfer and assign the 
Omitted Asset to Buyer or (ii) otherwise make the benefits of such Omitted 
Asset available to Buyer.  Any consideration payable by Buyer for any such 
Omitted Assets shall be deemed to have already been included in the 
Purchase Price for the Purchased Assets.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, 
Buyer shall be responsible for payment of any fees or costs associated with 
the transfer of any Omitted Assets.

indemnification pursuant to this Article VI (an Indemnified Party) must 
give the other Party from whom indemnification is sought (an Indemnifying 
Party) written notice of such claim (a Claim Notice) [***] after the 
Indemnified Party receives any written notice of any Proceeding against or 
involving the Indemnified Party by a Governmental Authority or other third 
party, or otherwise discovers the liability, obligation or facts giving 
rise to such claim for indemnification (Claim); provided that the failure 
to notify or delay in notifying an Indemnifying Party will not relieve the

Indemnifying Party.  Such Claim Notice must contain a description of the 
Claim and the nature and amount of such Loss (to the extent that the nature 
and amount of such Loss is known or reasonably ascertainable at such time; 
provided that such amount or estimated amount shall not be conclusive of 
the final amount, if any, of such Claim).  Notwithstanding the foregoing,

delivered prior to the expiration of the applicable survival term set forth 
in Section 6.1.

to the subject matter of this Agreement.  Notwithstanding anything to the 
contrary contained in the foregoing, nothing herein shall (i) limit the
