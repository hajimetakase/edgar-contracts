Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio
Applicable Margin for Eurodollar Loans
Applicable Margin for ABR Loans
Commitment Fee Rate
<3.00 to 1.00
2.00%
1.00%
0.375%
≥ 3.00 to 1.00 and ≤ 3.50 to 1.00
2.25%
1.25%
0.375%
> 3.50 to 1.00 and ≤ 4.00 to 1.00
2.50%
1.50%
0.375%

Applicable Pricing Grid shall apply. Each determination of the Consolidated 
Total Leverage Ratio pursuant to the Applicable Pricing Grid shall be made 
in a manner consistent with the determination thereof pursuant to Section 
7.1. In the event that any financial statement or compliance certificate 
delivered pursuant to Section 6.1(a), Section 6.1(b) or Section 6.2(a) is 
shown to be inaccurate (regardless of whether this Agreement or the 
Commitments are in effect when such inaccuracy is discovered), and such 
inaccuracy, if corrected, would have led to the application of a higher 
Applicable Margin for any period (an “Applicable Period”) than the 
Applicable Margin applied




3

for such Applicable Period, and only in such case, then Borrower shall 
immediately (a) deliver to the Administrative Agent a corrected compliance 
certificate for such Applicable Period, (b) determine the Applicable Margin 
for such Applicable Period based upon the corrected compliance certificate, 
and (c) immediately pay to the Administrative Agent the accrued additional 
interest owing as a result of such increased Applicable Margin for such 
Applicable Period, which payment shall be promptly applied by the 
Administrative Agent in accordance with Section 2.12. The preceding 
sentence is in addition to rights of the Administrative Agent and Lenders 
with respect to Section 2.9(c) and Section 8.1 and other of their 
respective rights under this Agreement

proceeds to any Group Member (valued at the initial principal amount

securities and valued at fair market value in the case of other non-cash 
proceeds) in excess of $2,500,000 individually or in excess of $5,000,000 
in the aggregate in any fiscal year; provided that when used in the

include any Disposition permitted by Section 7.5(h) and (ii) include any 
Disposition permitted by clause (j) of Section 7.5 that yields gross 
proceeds to any Group Member (valued at the initial principal amount 
thereof in the case of non-cash proceeds consisting of notes or other debt 
securities and valued at fair market value in the case of other non-cash 
proceeds) in excess of $250,000 individually or in excess of $500,000 in 
the aggregate in any fiscal year.

the Administrative Agent, has taken any action in furtherance of, or 
indicating its consent to, approval of, or acquiescence in, any such 
proceeding or appointment, provided that a Bankruptcy Event shall not 
result solely by virtue of any ownership interest, or the acquisition of 
any ownership interest, in such Person by a Governmental Authority or

Consolidated EBITDA for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters to 
and including, as applicable, the date of any Material Disposition, 
Material Acquisition or redesignation of any Subsidiary as either an 
Unrestricted Subsidiary or a Restricted Subsidiary (each, a “Reference

Restricted Subsidiary shall have made a Material Disposition, Consolidated 
EBITDA for such Reference Period shall be calculated on a Pro Forma Basis 
as if such Material Disposition occurred on the first day of such Reference 
Period, (ii) if during such Reference Period the Borrower or any Restricted 
Subsidiary shall have made a Material Acquisition, Consolidated EBITDA for 
such Reference Period shall be calculated on a Pro Forma Basis as if such 
Material Acquisition occurred on the first day of such Reference Period and 
(iii) if during such Reference Period a Subsidiary shall be redesignated as

(a) constitutes (i) assets comprising all or substantially all of an 
operating unit of a business, (ii) all or substantially all of a 
stand-alone operating facility or facilities of a Person or (iii) all or 
substantially all of the common stock of a Person and (b) involves the 
payment of consideration by the Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries 
involving Acquisition Consideration in excess of $10,000,000; provided 
that, for the avoidance of doubt, the parties hereto agree that the 
acquisition of the Ergon Terminals in connection with the Ergon 
Transactions shall be deemed to be a Material Acquisition pursuant to the 
terms and provisions of this Agreement; and “Material Disposition” means 
any Asset Sale or series of related Asset Sales that yields gross proceeds 
to any Group Member (valued at the initial principal amount thereof in the 
case of non-cash proceeds consisting of notes or other debt securities and 
valued at fair market value in the case of other non-cash proceeds) in 
excess of $10,000,000. Furthermore, in the event the Borrower or any of its 
Restricted Subsidiaries undertakes a Material Project, a Material Project 
Consolidated EBITDA Adjustment may be added to Consolidated EBITDA at 
Borrower’s option. As used herein a “Material Project Consolidated EBITDA 
Adjustment” means, with respect to each Material Project:


(a) prior to the Commercial Operation Date of a Material Project (but 
including the fiscal quarter in which such Commercial Operation Date 
occurs), a percentage (based upon the then-current completion percentage of 
such Material Project) of an amount to be approved by the Administrative 
Agent as the projected Consolidated EBITDA attributable to such Material 
Project for the first 12-month period following the Scheduled Commercial 
Operation Date (as hereinafter defined) of such Material Project (such 
amount to be determined based on customer contracts or tariff-based 
customers relating to such Material Project, the creditworthiness of the 
other parties to such contracts or such tariff-based customers, and 
projected revenues from such contracts, tariffs, capital costs and 
expenses, Scheduled Commercial Operation Date, and other factors reasonably 
deemed appropriate by the Administrative Agent), which amount may, at the 
Borrower’s option, be added to actual Consolidated EBITDA for the fiscal 
quarter in which construction of such Material Project commences and for 
each fiscal quarter thereafter until the Commercial Operation Date of such 
Material Project (including the fiscal quarter in which such Commercial 
Operation Date occurs, but net of any actual Consolidated EBITDA of the 
Borrower attributable to such Material Project following such Commercial 
Operation Date); provided that if the projection of Consolidated EBITDA 
attributable to such Material Project is revised prior to the Commercial 
Operation Date of such Material Project by an amount




8
------------------------------------------------------------------------


that exceeds the greater of (1) $2,500,000 and (2) 5% of the most recent 
projection of Consolidated EBITDA delivered to the Administrative Agent 
with respect to such Material Project, the Borrower shall provide the 
Administrative Agent with such revised projections together with a revised 
Material Project Consolidated EBITDA Adjustment reflecting such revised 
projections, which new Material Project Consolidated EBITDA Adjustment 
shall be subject to approval by the Administrative Agent; provided further 
that if the actual Commercial Operation Date does not occur by the 
Scheduled Commercial Operation Date, then the foregoing amount shall be 
reduced, for quarters ending after the Scheduled Commercial Operation Date 
to (but excluding) the first full quarter after its actual Commercial 
Operation Date, by the following percentage amounts depending on the period 
of delay (based on the period of actual delay or then-estimated delay, 
whichever is longer): (i) 90 days or less, 0%, (ii) longer than 90 days, 
but not more than 180 days, 25%, (iii) longer than 180 days but not more 
than 270 days, 50%, and (iv) longer than 270 days, 100%; and


(b) beginning with the first full fiscal quarter following the Commercial 
Operation Date of a Material Project and for the two immediately succeeding 
fiscal quarters, an amount to be approved by the Administrative Agent as 
the projected Consolidated EBITDA of the Borrower attributable to such 
Material Project (determined and approved in the same manner as set forth 
in clause (a) above) for the balance of the four full fiscal quarter period 
following such Commercial Operation Date, which may, at Borrower’s option, 
be added to actual Consolidated EBITDA for such fiscal quarters (but net of 
any actual Consolidated EBITDA of the Borrower attributable to such 
Material Project following such Commercial Operation Date).


Notwithstanding the foregoing: (A) no Material Project Consolidated EBITDA 
Adjustment shall be allowed in any fiscal quarter with respect to any 
Material Project unless: (y) not later than 30 days (or such shorter period 
as is acceptable to the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion) 
prior to the delivery of any Compliance Certificate required by the terms 
and provisions of Section 6.2(a) to the extent Material Project 
Consolidated EBITDA Adjustments will be made to Consolidated EBITDA for the 
period covered by the applicable Compliance Certificate, the Borrower shall 
have delivered to the Administrative Agent written projections of 
Consolidated EBITDA of the Borrower (or the applicable Restricted 
Subsidiary) attributable to such Material Project and shall provide updated 
projections for such Material Project for each fiscal quarter in which such 
Material Project is ongoing until the Commercial Operation Date, and (z) 
prior to the date such compliance certificate is required to be delivered, 
the Administrative Agent shall have approved such projections and will have 
received such other information (including updated status reports 
summarizing each Material Project currently under construction and covering 
original anticipated and current projected cost, Capital Expenditures 
(completed and remaining), the anticipated Commercial Operation Date, which 
may not be modified without the consent of the Administrative Agent (the 
“Scheduled Commercial Operation Date”), total Material Project Consolidated 
EBITDA Adjustments and the portion thereof to be added to Consolidated 
EBITDA and other information regarding projected revenues, customers and 
contracts supporting such projections and the anticipated Commercial 
Operation Date) and documentation as the Administrative Agent may 
reasonably request, all in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to 
the Administrative Agent; and (B) the aggregate amount of all Material 
Project Consolidated EBITDA Adjustments during any period shall be limited

Restricted Subsidiaries for such period (which total actual Consolidated 
EBITDA shall be determined without including any Material Project 
Consolidated EBITDA Adjustments).

ARTICLE 2
AMOUNT AND TERMS OF COMMITMENTS


Section 2.1    Commitments and Existing Loans.


(a)    Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, each Lender severally 
agrees to make Loans to the Borrower from time to time during the 
Commitment Period in an aggregate principal amount at any one time 
outstanding that will not result in (i) such Lender’s Revolving Extensions 
of Credit exceeding such Lender’s Commitment or (ii) the Total Revolving 
Extensions of Credit exceeding the Total




30
------------------------------------------------------------------------


Commitments. During the Commitment Period the Borrower may use the 
Commitments by borrowing, prepaying the Loans in whole or in part, and 
reborrowing, all in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof. The 
Loans may from time to time be Eurodollar Loans or ABR Loans, as determined 
by the Borrower and notified to the Administrative Agent in accordance with 
Section 2.2 and Section 2.7.


(b)    The Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay to the 
Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender the then unpaid 
principal amount of each Loan on the Maturity Date.


(c)    As of the effectiveness of this Agreement, any “Loans” as defined in 
the Existing Credit Agreement that are outstanding shall be deemed to be 
Loans hereunder made in accordance with Section 2.1(a) by the Lenders 
hereunder after giving effect to Section 10.22.


Section 2.2    Procedure for Borrowing. Subject to the terms and conditions 
hereof, the Borrower may borrow Loans during the Commitment Period on any 
Business Day, provided that the Borrower shall deliver to the 
Administrative Agent an irrevocable Borrowing Request (which must be 
received by the Administrative Agent prior to 11:00 A.M., New York City 
time, (a) three Business Days prior to the requested Borrowing Date, in the 
case of Eurodollar Loans, or (b) on the requested Borrowing Date, in the 
case of ABR Loans), specifying (i) the amount and Type of Loans to be 
borrowed, (ii) the requested Borrowing Date and (iii) in the case of 
Eurodollar Loans, the respective amounts of each such Type of Loan and the 
respective lengths of the initial Interest Period therefor. Each borrowing 
of Loans shall be in an amount equal to (x) in the case of ABR Loans, 
$1,000,000 or a whole multiple thereof (or, if the then aggregate Available 
Commitments are less than $1,000,000, such lesser amount) and (y) in the 
case of Eurodollar Loans, $5,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in 
excess thereof. Upon receipt of any Borrowing Request from the Borrower, 
the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender thereof. Each 
Lender will make the amount of its pro rata share of each borrowing 
available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Borrower at 
the Funding Office prior to 12:00 Noon, New York City time, on the 
Borrowing Date requested by the Borrower in funds immediately available to 
the Administrative Agent. Such borrowing will then be made available to the 
Borrower by the Administrative Agent crediting the account of the Borrower 
on the books of such office with the aggregate of the amounts made 
available to the Administrative Agent by the Lenders and in like funds as 
received by the Administrative Agent.


Section 2.3    Commitment Fees, etc.  


(a)    The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the 
account of each Lender a commitment fee (the “Commitment Fee”) for the 
period from and including the date hereof to the last day of the Commitment 
Period, computed at the Commitment Fee Rate on the average daily amount of 
the Available Commitment of such Lender during the period for which payment 
is made, payable quarterly in arrears on each Fee Payment Date, commencing 
on the first such date to occur after the date hereof.


(b)    The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent the fees in 
the amounts and on the dates as set forth in any fee agreements entered 
into in connection with this Agreement with the Administrative Agent and to 
perform any other obligations contained therein.


Section 2.4    Termination or Reduction of Commitments. Subject to the 
payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.15, the Borrower shall 
have the right, upon not less than three Business Days’ notice to the 
Administrative Agent, to terminate the Commitments or, from time to time, 
to reduce the amount of the Commitments; provided that no such termination 
or reduction of Commitments shall be permitted if, after giving effect 
thereto and to any prepayments of the Loans made on the effective date 
thereof, the Total Revolving Extensions of Credit would exceed the Total 
Commitments. Any such reduction shall be in an amount equal to $1,000,000, 
or a whole multiple thereof, and shall reduce permanently the Commitments




31
------------------------------------------------------------------------


then in effect. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 2.4 or Section 2.5
 to the contrary, the Borrower may rescind any notice of termination and 
notice of prepayment in full of the Loans and Commitments of all the 
Lenders under this Section 2.4 and Section 2.5, in each case that states 
such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of the refinancing of the 
Loans, not later than 1:00 P.M., New York City time, on the Business Day 
before such termination and prepayment was scheduled to take place if such 
termination and prepayment would have resulted from a refinancing of the 
Loans, which financing shall not be consummated or shall otherwise be 
delayed.


Section 2.5    Optional Prepayments. The Borrower may at any time and from 
time to time prepay the Loans, in whole or in part, without premium or 
penalty, upon irrevocable notice (subject to the last sentence of Section 
2.4) delivered to the Administrative Agent no later than 12:00 Noon, New 
York City time, three Business Days prior thereto, in the case of 
Eurodollar Loans, and no later than 12:00 Noon, New York City time, one 
Business Day prior thereto, in the case of ABR Loans, which notice shall 
specify the date and amount of prepayment, whether the prepayment is of 
Eurodollar Loans or ABR Loans; provided, that if a Eurodollar Loan is 
prepaid on any day other than the last day of the Interest Period 
applicable thereto, the Borrower shall also pay any amounts owing pursuant 
to Section 2.15. Upon receipt of any such notice the Administrative Agent 
shall promptly notify each relevant Lender thereof. If any such notice is 
given, the amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the 
date specified therein, together with (except in the case of Loans that are 
ABR Loans) accrued interest to such date on the amount prepaid. Partial 
prepayments Loans shall be in an aggregate principal amount of $1,000,000 
or a whole multiple thereof.


Section 2.6    Mandatory Prepayments. If on any date any Group Member shall 
receive Net Cash Proceeds from any Asset Sale or Recovery Event then, 
unless a Reinvestment Notice shall be delivered in respect thereof, such 
Net Cash Proceeds shall be applied on such date toward prepayment of the 
Loans; provided, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, on each Reinvestment 
Prepayment Date, an amount equal to the Reinvestment Prepayment Amount with 
respect to the relevant Reinvestment Event shall be applied toward 
prepayment of the Loans.


Section 2.7    Conversion and Continuation Options.


(a)     The Borrower may elect from time to time to convert Eurodollar 
Loans to ABR Loans by giving the Administrative Agent prior irrevocable 
notice of such election no later than 11:00 A.M., New York City time, on 
the Business Day preceding the proposed conversion date, provided that any 
such conversion of Eurodollar Loans may only be made on the last day of an 
Interest Period with respect thereto. The Borrower may elect from time to 
time to convert ABR Loans to Eurodollar Loans by giving the Administrative 
Agent prior irrevocable notice of such election no later than 11:00 A.M., 
New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding the proposed 
conversion date (which notice shall specify the length of the initial 
Interest Period therefor), provided that no ABR Loan may be converted into 
a Eurodollar Loan when any Event of Default has occurred and is continuing. 
Upon receipt of any such notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly 
notify each relevant Lender thereof.


(b)    Any Eurodollar Loan may be continued as such upon the expiration of 
the then current Interest Period with respect thereto by the Borrower 
giving irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent, in accordance with 
the applicable provisions of the term “Interest Period” set forth in 
Section 1.1, of the length of the next Interest Period to be applicable to 
such Loans, provided that no Eurodollar Loan may be continued as such when 
any Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, and provided, further
, that if the Borrower shall fail to give any required notice as described 
above in this paragraph such Loans shall be automatically converted to ABR 
Loans on the last day of such then expiring Interest Period. Upon receipt 
of any such notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each 
relevant Lender thereof.




32
------------------------------------------------------------------------


Section 2.8    Limitations on Eurodollar Tranches. Notwithstanding anything 
to the contrary in this Agreement, all borrowings, conversions and 
continuations of Eurodollar Loans and all selections of Interest Periods 
shall be in such amounts and be made pursuant to such elections so that, 
(a) after giving effect thereto, the aggregate principal amount of the 
Eurodollar Loans comprising each Eurodollar Tranche shall be equal to 
$5,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and (b) no 
more than eight Eurodollar Tranches shall be outstanding at any one time.


Section 2.9    Interest Rates and Payment Dates.


(a)    Each Eurodollar Loan shall bear interest for each day during each 
Interest Period with respect thereto at a rate per annum equal to the 
Eurodollar Rate determined for such day plus the Applicable Margin.


(b)    Each ABR Loan shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the 
ABR plus the Applicable Margin.


(c)    (i) If all or a portion of the principal amount of any Loan or 
Reimbursement Obligation shall not be paid when due (whether at the stated 
maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), such overdue amount shall bear 
interest at a rate per annum equal to (x) in the case of the Loans, the 
rate that would otherwise be applicable thereto pursuant to the foregoing 
provisions of this Section 2.9 plus 2% or (y) in the case of Reimbursement 
Obligations, the rate applicable to ABR Loans plus 2%, and (ii) if all or a 
portion of any interest payable on any Loan or Reimbursement Obligation or 
any Commitment Fee or other amount payable hereunder shall not be paid when 
due (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), such 
overdue amount shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the rate 
then applicable to ABR Loans plus 2%, in each case, with respect to clauses 
(i) and (ii) above, from the date of such nonpayment until such amount is 
paid in full (as well after as before judgment).


(d)    Interest shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date, 
provided that interest accruing pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section 
2.9 shall be payable from time to time on demand.


Section 2.10    Computation of Interest and Fees.


(a)    Interest and fees payable pursuant hereto shall be calculated on the 
basis of a 360-day year for the actual days elapsed, except that, with 
respect to ABR Loans the rate of interest on which is calculated on the 
basis of the Prime Rate, the interest thereon shall be calculated on the 
basis of a 365- (or 366-, as the case may be) day year for the actual days 
elapsed. The Administrative Agent shall as soon as practicable notify the 
Borrower and the relevant Lenders of each determination of a Eurodollar 
Rate. Any change in the interest rate on a Loan resulting from a change in 
the ABR or the Eurocurrency Reserve Requirements shall become effective as 
of the opening of business on the day on which such change becomes 
effective. The Administrative Agent shall as soon as practicable notify the 
Borrower and the relevant Lenders of the effective date and the amount of 
each such change in interest rate.


(b)    Each determination of an interest rate by the Administrative Agent 
pursuant to any provision of this Agreement shall be conclusive and binding 
on the Borrower and the Lenders in the absence of manifest error.




33
------------------------------------------------------------------------


Section 2.11    Inability to Determine Interest Rate. If prior to the first 
day of any Interest Period:


(a)    the Administrative Agent shall have determined (which determination 
shall be conclusive and binding upon the Borrower) that, by reason of 
circumstances affecting the relevant market, adequate and reasonable means 
do not exist for ascertaining the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period, 
or


(b)    the Administrative Agent has received notice from the Required 
Lenders that the Eurodollar Rate determined or to be determined for such 
Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such 
Lenders (as conclusively certified by such Lenders) of making or 
maintaining their affected Loans during such Interest Period, the 
Administrative Agent shall give telecopy or telephonic notice thereof to 
the Borrower and the relevant Lenders as soon as practicable thereafter. If 
such notice is given (x) any Eurodollar Loans requested to be made on the 
first day of such Interest Period shall be made as ABR Loans, (y) any Loans 
that were to have been converted on the first day of such Interest Period 
to Eurodollar Loans shall be continued as ABR Loans and (z) any outstanding 
Eurodollar Loans shall be converted, on the last day of the then-current 
Interest Period, to ABR Loans. Until such notice has been withdrawn by the 
Administrative Agent, no further Eurodollar Loans shall be made or 
continued as such, nor shall the Borrower have the right to convert Loans 
under to Eurodollar Loans.


Section 2.12    Pro Rata Treatment and Payments.


(a)    Each borrowing by the Borrower from the Lenders hereunder, each 
payment by the Borrower on account of any Commitment Fee and any reduction 
of the Commitments of the Lenders shall be made pro rata according to the 
Applicable Percentages of the Lenders.


(b)    Each payment (including each prepayment) by the Borrower on account 
of principal of and interest on the Loans shall be made pro rata according 
to the respective outstanding principal amounts of the Loans then held by 
the Lenders.


(c)    All payments (including prepayments) to be made by the Borrower 
hereunder, whether on account of principal, interest, fees or otherwise, 
shall be made without setoff or counterclaim and shall be made prior to 
2:00 P.M., New York City time, on the due date thereof to the 
Administrative Agent, for the account of the Lenders, at the Funding 
Office, in Dollars and in immediately available funds. The Administrative 
Agent shall distribute such payments to each relevant Lender promptly upon 
receipt in like funds as received, net of any amounts owing by such Lender 
pursuant to Section 9.7. If any payment hereunder (other than payments on 
the Eurodollar Loans) becomes due and payable on a day other than a 
Business Day, such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding 
Business Day. If any payment on a Eurodollar Loan becomes due and payable 
on a day other than a Business Day, the maturity thereof shall be extended 
to the next succeeding Business Day unless the result of such extension 
would be to extend such payment into another calendar month, in which event 
such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day. In 
the case of any extension of any payment of principal pursuant to the 
preceding two sentences, interest thereon shall be payable at the then 
applicable rate during such extension.


(d)    Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing 
by any Lender prior to a borrowing that such Lender will not make the 
amount that would constitute its share of such borrowing available to the 
Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender 
is making such amount available to the Administrative Agent, and the 
Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available 
to the Borrower a corresponding amount. If such amount is not made 
available to the Administrative Agent by the required time on the Borrowing 
Date therefor, such Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent, on 
demand, such amount with interest thereon, at a rate equal to the greater 
of (i) the Federal Funds Effective Rate and (ii) a rate determined by the 
Administrative Agent in accordance




34
------------------------------------------------------------------------


with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, for the period until 
such Lender makes such amount immediately available to the Administrative 
Agent. A certificate of the Administrative Agent submitted to any Lender 
with respect to any amounts owing under this paragraph shall be conclusive 
in the absence of manifest error. If such Lender’s share of such borrowing 
is not made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender within 
three Business Days after such Borrowing Date, the Administrative Agent 
shall also be entitled to recover such amount with interest thereon at the 
rate per annum applicable to ABR Loans, on demand, from the Borrower.


(e)    Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing 
by the Borrower prior to the date of any payment due to be made by the 
Borrower hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment to the 
Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower 
is making such payment, and the Administrative Agent may, but shall not be 
required to, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the 
Lenders their respective pro rata shares of a corresponding amount. If such 
payment is not made to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower within 
three Business Days after such due date, the Administrative Agent shall be 
entitled to recover, on demand, from each Lender to which any amount which 
was made available pursuant to the preceding sentence, such amount with 
interest thereon at the rate per annum equal to the daily average Federal 
Funds Effective Rate. Nothing herein shall be deemed to limit the rights of 
the Administrative Agent or any Lender against the Borrower.


(f)    If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by 
it hereunder, including, without limitation, pursuant to Section 2.12(d), 
Section 2.12(e), Section 3.5, Section 3.6, Section 9.7 or Section 10.5, 
then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion and notwithstanding 
any contrary provision hereof, (i) apply any amounts thereafter received by 
the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender for the benefit of 
the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Lenders to satisfy such Lender’s 
obligations to it under such Sections until all such unsatisfied 
obligations are fully paid, and/or (ii) hold any such amounts in a 
segregated account as cash collateral for, and application to, any future 
funding obligations of such Lender under any such Sections, in the case of 
each of clauses (i) and (ii) above, in any order as determined by the 
Administrative Agent in its discretion.


(g)    Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary contained 
herein, (i) if any Defaulting Lender shall have failed to fund all or any 
portion of any Loan (each such Loan, an “Affected Loan”), each prepayment 
of Loans by the Borrower under Section 2.8 shall be applied first to such 
Affected Loan and the principal amount and interest with respect to such 
payment shall be distributed (x) to each Lender that is not a Defaulting 
Lender (each, a “Non-Defaulting Lender”) pro rata based on the outstanding 
principal amount of Affected Loans owing to all Non-Defaulting Lenders, 
until the principal amount of all Affected Loans has been repaid in full 
and (y) to the extent of any remaining amount of such prepayment, to each 
Lender pro rata in accordance with such Lender’s Applicable Percentage, and 
(ii) each payment made by the Borrower on account of the interest on any 
Affected Loans shall be distributed to each Non-Defaulting Lender pro rata 
based on the outstanding principal amount of Affected Loans owing to all 
Non-Defaulting Lenders.


Section 2.13    Requirements of Law.


(a)    If the adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law or in the 
interpretation or application thereof or compliance by any Lender or other 
Recipient with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of 
law) from any central bank or other Governmental Authority made subsequent 
to the date hereof:




35
------------------------------------------------------------------------


(i)    shall subject any Recipient to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified 
Taxes, (B) Other Connection Taxes that are imposed on or measured by net 
income (however denominated) or that are franchise Taxes or branch profits 
Taxes, and (C) Taxes described in clause (b) or (c) of the definition of 
Excluded Taxes) on its loans, letters of credit, commitments, or other 
obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital 
attributable thereto;


(ii)    shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve, special 
deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets held by, 
deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of, advances, loans or 
other extensions of credit by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any 
office of such Lender or other Recipient that is not otherwise included in 
the determination of the Eurodollar Rate; or


(iii)    shall impose on such Lender or other Recipient any other 
condition;


and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such 
Lender or such other Recipient, by an amount that such Lender or such other 
Recipient deems to be material, of making, converting into, continuing or 
maintaining Eurodollar Loans (or in the case of (i) any Loan) or issuing or 
participating in Letters of Credit, or to reduce any amount receivable 
hereunder in respect thereof, then, in any such case, the Borrower shall 
promptly pay such Lender or such other Recipient, within ten (10) Business 
Days after its written demand therefor, any additional amounts necessary to 
compensate such Lender or such other Recipient for such increased cost or 
reduced amount receivable. If any Lender or such other Recipient becomes 
entitled to claim any additional amounts pursuant to this paragraph, it 
shall promptly notify the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative 
Agent) of the event by reason of which it has become so entitled.


(b)    If any Recipient shall have determined that the adoption of or any 
change in any Requirement of Law regarding capital adequacy or liquidity or 
in the interpretation or application thereof or compliance by such 
Recipient or any corporation controlling such Recipient with any request or 
directive regarding capital adequacy or liquidity (whether or not having 
the force of law) from any Governmental Authority made subsequent to the 
date hereof shall have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such 
Recipient’s or such corporation’s capital as a consequence of its 
obligations hereunder or under or in respect of any Letter of Credit to a 
level below that which such Recipient or such corporation could have 
achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into 
consideration such Recipient’s or such corporation’s policies with respect 
to capital adequacy or liquidity) by an amount deemed by such Recipient to 
be material, then from time to time, after submission by such Recipient to 
the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of a written request 
therefor, the Borrower shall pay to such Recipient such additional amount 
or amounts as will compensate such Recipient or such corporation for such 
reduction.


(c)    A certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the calculation of 
any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section submitted by any 
Lender or Issuing Lender to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative 
Agent) shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section, the Borrower 
shall not be required to compensate a Lender or an Issuing Lender pursuant 
to this Section for any amounts incurred more than nine months prior to the 
date that such Lender or Issuing Lender notifies the Borrower of such 
Lender’s or Issuing Lender’s intention to claim compensation therefor; 
provided that, if the circumstances giving rise to such claim have a 
retroactive effect, then such nine-month period shall be extended to 
include the period of such retroactive effect. The obligations of the 
Borrower pursuant to this Section shall survive the termination of this 
Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable 
hereunder.




36
------------------------------------------------------------------------


(d)    For the purposes of this Agreement, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street 
Reform and Consumer Protection Act and all requests, guidelines or 
directives in connection therewith or promulgated by the Bank for 
International Settlements, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision or 
the United States or foreign regulatory authorities, in each case, pursuant 
to Basel III, are deemed to have gone into effect and to have been adopted 
after the date of this Agreement.


Section 2.14    Taxes.


(a)    Withholding of Taxes; Gross-Up. Each payment by or on behalf of any 
Loan Party under this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be made 
without withholding for any Taxes, unless such withholding is required by 
any Requirement of Law. If any Withholding Agent determines, in its sole 
discretion exercised in good faith, that it is so required to withhold 
Taxes, then such Withholding Agent may so withhold and shall timely pay the 
full amount of withheld Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in 
accordance with applicable Requirement of Law. If such Taxes are 
Indemnified Taxes, then the amount payable by such Loan Party shall be 
increased as necessary so that, net of such withholding (including such 
withholding applicable to additional amounts payable under this Section), 
the applicable Recipient receives the amount it would have received had no 
such withholding been made.


(b)    Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower. The Borrower shall timely 
pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance 
with applicable law.


(c)    Evidence of Payments. As soon as practicable after any payment of 
Indemnified Taxes by any Loan Party to a Governmental Authority pursuant to 
this Section 2.14, such Loan Party shall deliver to the Administrative 
Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such 
Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return 
reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably 
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.


(d)    Indemnification by the Borrower. The Borrower shall indemnify each 
Recipient for any Indemnified Taxes that are paid or payable by such 
Recipient in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document 
(including amounts paid or payable under this Section 2.14(d)) and any 
reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or 
not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by 
the relevant Governmental Authority. The indemnity under this Section 
2.14(d) shall be paid within 10 days after the Recipient delivers to the 
Borrower a certificate stating the amount of any Indemnified Taxes so paid 
or payable by such Recipient. Such certificate shall be conclusive of the 
amount so paid or payable absent manifest error. Such Recipient shall 
deliver a copy of such certificate to the Administrative Agent.


(e)    Indemnification by the Lenders. Each Lender shall severally 
indemnify the Administrative Agent for any Taxes (but, in the case of any 
Indemnified Taxes, only to the extent that the Borrower has not already 
indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without 
limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so) attributable to such 
Lender that are paid or payable by the Administrative Agent in connection 
with this Agreement or any other Loan Document and any reasonable expenses 
arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were 
correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental 
Authority. The indemnity under this Section 2.14(e) shall be paid within 10 
days after the Administrative Agent delivers to the applicable Lender a 
certificate stating the amount of Taxes so paid or payable by the 
Administrative Agent. Such certificate shall be conclusive of the amount so 
paid or payable absent manifest error.


(f)    Status of Lenders.




37
------------------------------------------------------------------------


(i)    Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from, or reduction of, 
any applicable withholding Tax with respect to any payments under this 
Agreement or any other Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the 
Administrative Agent, at the time or times prescribed by any Requirement of 
Law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, 
such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by 
the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be 
made without, or at a reduced rate of, withholding. In addition, any 
Lender, if requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall 
deliver such other documentation prescribed by any Requirement of Law or 
reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will 
enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not 
such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting 
requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two 
sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation 
(other than such documentation set forth in Sections 2.14(f)(ii) (excluding 
(ii)(F)) and (iii) below) shall not be required if in the Lender's judgment 
such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any 
material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the 
legal or commercial position of such Lender. Upon the reasonable request of 
such Borrower or the Administrative Agent, any Lender shall update any form 
or certification previously delivered pursuant to this Section 2.14(f). If 
any form or certification previously delivered pursuant to this Section 
expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect with respect to a 
Lender, such Lender shall promptly (and in any event within 10 days after 
such expiration, obsolescence or inaccuracy) notify such Borrower and the 
Administrative Agent in writing of such expiration, obsolescence or 
inaccuracy and update the form or certification if it is legally eligible 
to do so.


(ii)    Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if the Borrower 
is a U.S. Person, any Lender with respect to such Borrower shall, if (in 
the case of Sections 2.14(f)(ii)(B) through (F) below) it is legally 
eligible to do so, deliver to such Borrower and the Administrative Agent 
(in such number of copies reasonably requested by such Borrower and the 
Administrative Agent) on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes 
a party hereto (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable 
request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), duly completed and 
executed copies of whichever of the following is applicable:


(A)    in the case of a Lender that is a U.S. Person, IRS Form W-9 
certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. Federal backup withholding 
tax;


(B)    in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender claiming the benefits of an income 
tax treaty to which the United States is a party (1) with respect to 
payments of interest under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form 
W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. Federal 
withholding Tax pursuant to the "interest" article of such tax treaty and 
(2) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, 
IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or 
reduction of, U.S. Federal withholding Tax pursuant to the "business 
profits" or "other income" article of such tax treaty;


(C)    in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender for whom payments under any Loan 
Document constitute income that is effectively connected with such Lender's 
conduct of a trade or business in the United States, IRS Form W-8ECI;


(D)    in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender claiming the benefits of the 
exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code both (1) 
IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E and (2) a certificate substantially in 
the form of Exhibit I (a “U.S. Tax Certificate”) to the effect that such 
Lender is not (a) a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of 
the Code, (b) a “10 percent shareholder” of the Borrower within the meaning 
of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, (c) a “controlled




38
------------------------------------------------------------------------


foreign corporation” described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code or (d) 
conducting a trade or business in the United States with which the relevant 
interest payments are effectively connected;


(E)    in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender that is not the beneficial owner of 
payments made under any Loan Document (including a partnership or a 
participating Lender) (1) an IRS Form W-8IMY on behalf of itself and (2) 
the relevant forms prescribed in clauses (A), (B), (C), (D) and (F) of this 
paragraph (f)(ii) that would be required of each such beneficial owner or 
partner of such partnership if such beneficial owner or partner were a 
Lender; provided, however, that if the Lender is a partnership and one or 
more of its partners are claiming the exemption for portfolio interest 
under Section 881(c) of the Code, such Lender may provide a U.S. Tax 
Certificate on behalf of such partners; or


(F)    any other form prescribed by any Requirement of Law as a basis for 
claiming exemption from, or a reduction of, U.S. Federal withholding Tax 
together with such supplementary documentation necessary to enable the 
Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the amount of Tax (if 
any) required by any Requirement of Law to be withheld.


(iii)    If a payment made to a Lender under this Agreement or any other 
Loan Document would be subject to U.S. Federal withholding Tax imposed by 
FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting 
requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 
1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the 
Withholding Agent, at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time 
or times reasonably requested by the Withholding Agent, such documentation 
prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 
1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably 
requested by the Withholding Agent as may be necessary for the Withholding 
Agent to comply with its obligations under FATCA, to determine that such 
Lender has complied with such Lender's obligations under FATCA or to 
determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for 
purposes of this Section 2.14(f)(iii), “FATCA” shall include any amendments 
made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.


(g)    Treatment of Certain Refunds. If any party determines, in its sole 
discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any 
Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section 2.14 
(including by the payment of additional amounts paid pursuant to this 
Section 2.14), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to 
such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made (including 
additional amounts paid) under this Section with respect to the Taxes 
giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including 
any Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any 
interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such 
refund). Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified 
party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid to such 
indemnified party pursuant to the previous sentence (plus any penalties, 
interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) 
in the event such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to 
such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in 
this Section 2.14(g), in no event will any indemnified party be required to 
pay any amount to any indemnifying party pursuant to this Section 2.14(g) 
to the extent that such payment would place such indemnified party in a 
less favorable position (on a net after-Tax basis) than such indemnified 
party would have been in if the indemnification payments or additional 
amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid. This Section 
2.14(g) shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make 
available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes 
which it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.


(h)    Defined Terms. For purposes of this Section 2.14, the terms 
“applicable law” and “Requirement of Law” each includes FATCA and the term 
“Lender” includes any Issuing Lender.




39
------------------------------------------------------------------------


(i)    Survival. Each party's obligations under this Section 2.14 shall 
survive any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the 
termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge 
of all other obligations under this Agreement.


(j)    For purposes of determining withholding Taxes imposed under FATCA, 
from and after the Closing Date, the Borrower and the Administrative Agent 
shall treat (and the Lenders hereby authorize the Borrower and the 
Administrative Agent to treat) this Agreement as not qualifying as a 
“grandfathered obligation” within the meaning of Treasury Regulation 
Section 1.1471-2(b)(2)(i).


Section 2.15    Indemnity. The Borrower agrees to indemnify each Lender 
for, and to hold each Lender harmless from, any loss or expense that such 
Lender may sustain or incur as a consequence of (a) default by the Borrower 
in making a borrowing of, conversion into or continuation of Eurodollar 
Loans after the Borrower has given a notice requesting the same in 
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, (b) default by the 
Borrower in making any prepayment of or conversion from Eurodollar Loans 
after the Borrower has given a notice thereof in accordance with the 
provisions of this Agreement or (c) the making of a payment or prepayment 
of Eurodollar Loans on a day that is not the last day of an Interest Period 
with respect thereto. Such indemnification may include an amount equal to 
the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest that would have accrued 
on the amount so prepaid, or not so borrowed, converted or continued, for 
the period from the date of such prepayment or of such failure to borrow, 
convert or continue to the last day of such Interest Period (or, in the 
case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, the Interest Period that 
would have commenced on the date of such failure) in each case at the 
applicable rate of interest for such Loans provided for herein (excluding, 
however, the Applicable Margin included therein, if any) over (ii) the 
amount of interest (as reasonably determined by such Lender) that would 
have accrued to such Lender on such amount by placing such amount on 
deposit for a comparable period with leading banks in the interbank 
eurodollar market. A certificate as to any amounts payable pursuant to this 
Section submitted to the Borrower by any Lender shall be conclusive in the 
absence of manifest error. This covenant shall survive the termination of 
this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable 
hereunder.


Section 2.16    Change of Lending Office. Each Lender agrees that, upon the 
occurrence of any event giving rise to the operation of Section 2.13 or 
Section 2.14(a) or (d) with respect to such Lender, it will, if requested 
by the Borrower, use reasonable efforts (subject to overall policy 
considerations of such Lender) to designate another lending office for any 
Loans affected by such event with the object of avoiding the consequences 
of such event; provided, that such designation is made on terms that, in 
the sole judgment of such Lender, cause such Lender and its lending 
office(s) to suffer no economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage, and 
provided, further, that nothing in this Section shall affect or postpone 
any of the obligations of the Borrower or the rights of any Lender pursuant 
to Section 2.13 or Section 2.14(a) or (d).


Section 2.17    Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.


(a)    If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.13, or if any 
Loan Party is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any 
Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 
2.14(a) or (d), then such Lender shall (at the request of the Borrower) use 
reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or 
booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations 
hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the 
judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate 
or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.13 or Section 2.14(a) or 
(d), as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such 
Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be 
disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all 
reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any 
such designation or assignment.




40
------------------------------------------------------------------------


(b)    If (i) any Lender requests reimbursement for amounts owing or the 
payment of additional amounts pursuant to Section 2.13 or Section 2.14(a) 
or (d), (ii) the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any 
Lender or Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender, (iii) any 
Lender does not consent to any proposed amendment, supplement, 
modification, consent or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any 
other Loan Document that requires the consent of each of the Lenders or 
each of the Lenders affected thereby (so long as the consent of the 
Required Lenders has been obtained) or (iv) becomes a Defaulting Lender, 
then the Borrower may, at its sole expense (including payment of the 
processing and recordation fee specified in Section 10.6(b)(ii)(B)) and 
effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require 
such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with 
and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 10.6), all its 
interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that 
shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a 
Lender accepts such assignment); provided that (x) if a Commitment is being 
assigned, the Borrower has received the prior written consent of any party 
required pursuant to Section 10.6, (y) such Lender has received payment of 
an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and 
participations in LC Disbursements, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees 
and all other amounts payable to it hereunder (including the payment of any 
breakage fee pursuant to Section 2.15), from the assignee (to the extent of 
such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower 
(in the case of all other amounts) and (z) in the case of any such 
assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.13 or 
payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.14(a), (b) or (d), such 
assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments. A 
Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, 
prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the 
circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and 
delegation cease to apply.


Section 2.18    Defaulting Lenders. Notwithstanding any provision of this 
Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then 
the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a 
Defaulting Lender:


(a)    fees shall cease to accrue on the Commitment of such Defaulting 
Lender pursuant to Section 2.3;


(b)    the Commitment and Revolving Extensions of Credit of such Defaulting 
Lender shall not be included in determining whether all Lenders or the 
Required Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder (including any 
consent to any amendment, waiver or other modification pursuant to Section 
10.1); provided, that this clause (b) shall not apply to the vote of a 
Defaulting Lender in the case of an amendment, waiver or other modification 
requiring the consent of all Lenders or each Lender affected thereby;  


(c)    if any LC Exposure exists at the time such Lender becomes a 
Defaulting Lender then:


   (i)    all or any part of the LC Exposure of such Defaulting Lender
   shall be reallocated among the non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with
   their respective Applicable Percentages but only to the extent (x) the
   sum of all non-Defaulting Lenders’ Revolving Extensions of Credit plus
   such Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure does not exceed the total of all
   non-Defaulting Lenders’ Commitments and (y) the conditions set forth in
   Section 5.2 are satisfied at such time;


   (ii)    if the reallocation described in clause (i) above cannot, or can
   only partially, be effected, the Borrower shall within one Business Day
   following notice by the Administrative Agent, cash collateralize for the
   benefit of each Issuing Lender only the Borrower’s obligations
   corresponding




41
------------------------------------------------------------------------


   to such Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure (after giving effect to any
   partial reallocation pursuant to clause (i) above) in accordance with
   the procedures set forth in Section 3.10 for so long as such LC Exposure
   is outstanding;


   (iii)    if the Borrower cash collateralizes any portion of such
   Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure pursuant to clause (ii) above, the
   Borrower shall not be required to pay any fees to such Defaulting Lender
   pursuant to Section 3.3(a) with respect to such Defaulting Lender’s LC
   Exposure during the period such Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure is cash
   collateralized;


   (iv)    if the LC Exposure of the non-Defaulting Lenders is reallocated
   pursuant to clause (i) above, then the fees payable to the Lenders
   pursuant to Section 2.3 and Section 3.3(a) shall be adjusted in
   accordance with such non-Defaulting Lenders’ Applicable Percentages; and


   (v)    if all or any portion of such Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure is
   neither reallocated nor cash collateralized pursuant to clause (i) or
   (ii) above, then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of any
   Issuing Lender or any other Lender hereunder, all letter of credit fees
   payable under Section 3.3(a) with respect to such Defaulting Lender’s LC
   Exposure shall be payable to such Issuing Lender until and to the extent
   that such LC Exposure is reallocated and/or cash collateralized; and


(d)    so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender, no Issuing Lender 
shall be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless 
it is satisfied that the related exposure and the Defaulting Lender’s then 
outstanding LC Exposure will be 100% covered by the Commitments of the 
non-Defaulting Lenders and/or cash collateral will be provided by the 
Borrower in accordance with Section 2.18(c), and participating interests in 
any newly issued or increased Letter of Credit shall be allocated among 
non-Defaulting Lenders in a manner consistent with Section 2.18(c)(i) (and 
such Defaulting Lender shall not participate therein).

If (i) a Bankruptcy Event with respect to a Parent of any Lender shall 
occur following the date hereof and for so long as such event shall 
continue or (ii) an Issuing Lender has a good faith belief that any Lender 
has defaulted in fulfilling its obligations under one or more other 
agreements in which such Lender commits to extend credit, such Issuing 
Lender shall not be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of 
Credit, unless such Issuing Lender shall have entered into arrangements 
with the Borrower or such Lender, satisfactory to such Issuing Lender to 
defease any risk to it in respect of such Lender hereunder.


In the event that the Administrative Agent, the Borrower and each Issuing 
Lender each agrees that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all 
matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then the LC 
Exposure of the Lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of 
such Lender’s Commitment and on such date such Lender shall purchase at par 
such of the Loans of the other Lenders as the Administrative Agent shall 
determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold such Loans in 
accordance with its Applicable Percentage. Once the conditions in the 
immediately preceding sentence have been satisfied, as determined by the 
Administrative Agent, such Lender shall no longer be deemed a Defaulting 
Lender, but such Lender shall in no event be entitled to any fees not paid 
to it in accordance with this Section 2.18 while such Lender was a 
Defaulting Lender.


Section 2.19    Increase in Commitments.


(a)    Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Borrower 
shall have the right from time to time, to cause an increase in the 
Commitments of the Lenders (a “Commitment Increase”) by adding to this 
Agreement one or more additional financial institutions that are not 
already Lenders




42
------------------------------------------------------------------------


hereunder and that are satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and each 
Issuing Lender (each, a “New Lender”) or by allowing one or more existing 
Lenders to increase their respective Commitments; provided that (i) both 
before and immediately after giving effect to such Commitment Increase, no 
Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing as of the 
effective date of such Commitment Increase (such date, the “Commitment 
Increase Date”), (ii) no such Commitment Increase shall be in an amount 
less than $25,000,000, (iii) after giving effect to such Commitment 
Increase, the Total Commitments shall not exceed $600,000,000 and (iv) no 
Lender’s Commitment shall be increased without such Lender’s prior written 
consent (which consent may be given or withheld in such Lender’s sole and 
absolute discretion).


(b)    The Borrower shall provide the Administrative Agent with written 
notice (a “Notice of Commitment Increase”) of its intention to increase the 
Commitments pursuant to this Section 2.19. Each such Notice of Commitment 
Increase shall specify (i) the proposed Commitment Increase Date, which 
date shall be no earlier than five (5) Business Days after receipt by the 
Administrative Agent of such Notice of Commitment Increase, (ii) the amount 
of the requested Commitment Increase, (iii) as applicable, the identity of 
each New Lender and Lender that has agreed in writing to increase its 
Commitment hereunder, and (iv) the amount of the respective Commitments of 
the then existing Lenders and the New Lenders from and after the Commitment 
Increase Date.


(c)    On any Commitment Increase Date, the Lenders (including the New 
Lenders) shall purchase and assume (without recourse or warranty) from the 
other Lenders (i) Loans, to the extent that there are any Loans then 
outstanding, and (ii) undivided participation interests in any outstanding 
LC Exposure, in each case, to the extent necessary to ensure that after 
giving effect to the Commitment Increase, each Lender has outstanding Loans 
and participation interests in outstanding LC Exposure equal to its 
Applicable Percentage of the Commitments. Each Lender shall make any 
payment required to be made by it pursuant to the preceding sentence via 
wire transfer to the Administrative Agent on the Commitment Increase Date. 
Each existing Lender (i) shall be automatically deemed to have assigned any 
outstanding Loans on the Commitment Increase Date and (ii) agrees to take 
any further steps reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent, in each 
case to the extent deemed necessary by the Administrative Agent to 
effectuate the provisions of the preceding sentences. If, on such 
Commitment Increase Date, any Loans that are Eurodollar Loans have been 
funded, then the Borrower shall be obligated to pay any breakage fees or 
costs that are payable pursuant to Section 2.15 in connection with the 
reallocation of such outstanding Loans to effectuate the provisions of this 
Section 2.19(c).


(d)    Each Commitment Increase shall become effective on its Commitment 
Increase Date and upon such effectiveness: (i) the Administrative Agent 
shall record in the register each then New Lender’s information as provided 
in the applicable Notice of Commitment Increase and pursuant to an 
Administrative Questionnaire that shall be executed and delivered by each 
New Lender to the Administrative Agent on or before such Commitment 
Increase Date, (ii) Schedule 1.1A shall be amended and restated to set 
forth all Lenders (including any New Lenders) that will be Lenders 
hereunder after giving effect to such Commitment Increase (which amended 
and restated Schedule 1.1A shall be set forth in Annex I to the applicable 
Notice of Commitment Increase) and the Administrative Agent shall 
distribute to each Lender (including each New Lender) a copy of such 
amended and restated Schedule 1.1A, and (iii) each New Lender identified on 
the Notice of Commitment Increase for such Commitment Increase shall be a 
“Lender” for all purposes under this Agreement.


(e)    As a condition precedent to any Commitment Increase, the Borrower 
shall deliver to the Administrative Agent (i) a certificate of a 
Responsible Officer dated as of the Commitment Increase Date certifying and 
attaching the resolutions adopted by the Borrower approving or consenting 
to such Commitment Increase and certifying that, before and after giving 
effect to such Commitment Increase, (A)




43
------------------------------------------------------------------------


the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement and the 
other Loan Documents made by it and the other Loan Parties are true and 
correct in all material respects on and as of the Commitment Increase Date, 
except to the extent that such representations and warranties specifically 
refer to an earlier date (in which case such representations and warranties 
shall be true and correct in all material respects on and as of such 
earlier date) and (B) no Default or Event of Default exists or will exist 
as of the Commitment Increase Date, and (ii) any legal opinions, 
certificates and/or other documents reasonably requested by the 
Administrative Agent in connection with the Commitment Increase.


(f)    No increase in any Commitment, any extension of the Maturity Date or 
any renewal or extension of any Commitment or Loans of any Lender that is a 
regulated financial institution or any Affiliate of such a Lender (each, a 
“Regulated Lender Entity”) shall occur until the earlier to occur of (x) 
five (5) Business Days after each such Regulated Lender Entity 
participating in such increase or whose Commitment or Loans are to be 
renewed or extended as a result thereof has received the documentation 
described in Section 6.5(d) with respect to each Improved Real Property 
that is, or is to become, subject to a Mortgage and (y) the date such 
Regulated Lender Entity confirms to the Administrative Agent its 
satisfaction with compliance with the Flood Insurance Laws with respect to 
such Improved Real Property (such confirmation not to be unreasonably 
withheld, conditioned or delayed, and to be delivered promptly upon such 
completion by the applicable Regulated Lender Entity).


Section 2.20    Notes. The Borrower's obligation to pay the principal of 
and interest on all the Loans made to it by each Lender shall, if requested 
by a Lender, be evidenced, by a Note in substantially the form of Exhibit A
, duly executed and delivered by the Borrower, with blanks appropriately 
completed in conformity herewith. The date, amount, Type, interest rate 
and, if applicable, Interest Period of each Loan made by each Lender, and 
all payments made on account of the principal thereof, shall be recorded by 
such Lender on its books for its Note. Failure to make any such notation 
shall not affect any Lender’s or the Borrower’s rights or obligations in 
respect of such Loans or affect the validity of such transfer by any Lender 
of its Note.

ARTICLE 3
LETTERS OF CREDIT


Section 3.1    Letters of Credit.


(a)    General. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the 
Borrower may request the issuance of Dollar denominated Letters of Credit 
for its own account or the account of any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, 
in a form reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent and any Issuing 
Lender, at any time and from time to time during the Commitment Period. In 
the event of any inconsistency between the terms and conditions of this 
Agreement and the terms and conditions of any form of letter of credit 
application or other agreement submitted by the Borrower to, or entered 
into by the Borrower with, an Issuing Lender relating to any Letter of 
Credit, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control. No 
Issuing Lender shall at any time be obligated to issue any Letter of Credit 
if such issuance would conflict with, or cause such Issuing Lender or any 
Lender purchasing a participation therein to exceed any limits imposed by, 
any applicable Requirement of Law.


Section 3.2    Notice of Issuance, Amendment, Renewal, Extension; Certain 
Conditions. To request the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or the 
amendment, renewal or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit), the 
Borrower shall hand deliver or telecopy (or transmit by electronic 
communication, if arrangements for doing so have been approved by the 
applicable Issuing Lender) to the applicable Issuing Lender and the 
Administrative Agent (not less than three (3) Business Days in advance of 
the requested date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension) a notice:




44
------------------------------------------------------------------------


(a)    requesting the issuance of a Letter of Credit or identifying the 
Letter of Credit to be amended, renewed or extended;


(b)    specifying the date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension 
(which shall be a Business Day);


(c)    specifying the date on which such Letter of Credit is to expire 
(which shall comply with Section 3.4));


(d)    specifying the amount of such Letter of Credit; and


(e)    specifying the name and address of the beneficiary thereof and such 
other information as shall be necessary to prepare, amend, renew or extend 
such Letter of Credit.


Each notice shall constitute a representation that after giving effect to 
the requested issuance, amendment, renewal or extension, as applicable, (i) 
(A) the LC Exposure shall not exceed the LC Commitment and (B) the 
aggregate undrawn and unexpired amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit 
issued by each Issuing Lender shall not exceed such Issuing Lender’s LC 
Issuing Lender Commitment and (ii) the Total Revolving Extensions of Credit 
shall not exceed the Total Commitments. No letter of credit issued by any 
Issuing Lender (if such Issuing Lender is not the Administrative Agent) 
shall be deemed to be a “Letter of Credit” issued under this Agreement 
unless such Issuing Lender has requested and received written confirmation 
from the Administrative Agent that the representations by Borrower 
contained in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) are true and correct.


If requested by an Issuing Lender, the Borrower also shall submit a letter 
of credit application on such Issuing Lender’s standard form in connection 
with any request for a Letter of Credit.


Section 3.3    Fees and Other Charges.


(a)    The Borrower will pay a fee on all outstanding Letters of Credit at 
a per annum rate equal to the Applicable Margin then in effect with respect 
to Eurodollar Loans, shared ratably among the Lenders and payable quarterly 
in arrears on each Fee Payment Date after the issuance date. In addition, 
the Borrower shall pay to each Issuing Lender for its own account a 
fronting fee of 0.20% per annum on the undrawn and unexpired amount of each 
Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender, payable quarterly in 
arrears on each Fee Payment Date after the issuance date.


(b)    In addition to the foregoing fees, the Borrower shall pay or 
reimburse each Issuing Lender for such normal and customary costs and 
expenses as are incurred or charged by such Issuing Lender in issuing, 
negotiating, effecting payment under, amending or otherwise administering 
any Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender.


Section 3.4    Expiration Date. Each Letter of Credit shall expire at or 
prior to the close of business on the earlier of (i) the date one year 
after the date of the issuance of such Letter of Credit (or, in the case of 
any renewal or extension thereof, one year after such renewal or extension, 
but in no event later than the date specified in clause (ii) below) and 
(ii) the date that is five Business Days prior to the Maturity Date.


Section 3.5    Participations. By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an 
amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) and without 
any further action on the part of an Issuing Lender or the Lenders, such 
Issuing Lender hereby grants to each Lender, and each Lender hereby 
acquires from such Issuing Lender, a participation in such Letter of Credit 
equal to such Lender’s Applicable Percentage of the




45
------------------------------------------------------------------------


aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. In 
consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Lender hereby 
absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, 
for the account of each Issuing Lender, such Lender’s Applicable Percentage 
of each LC Disbursement made by such Issuing Lender and not reimbursed by 
the Borrower on the date due as provided in Section 3.6, or of any 
reimbursement payment required to be refunded to the Borrower for any 
reason. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire 
participations pursuant to this Section 3.5 in respect of Letters of Credit 
is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance 
whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of 
Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or an Event of 
Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments, and that each such 
payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or 
reduction whatsoever.


Section 3.6    Reimbursement. If an Issuing Lender shall make any LC 
Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall reimburse 
such LC Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent an amount equal 
to such LC Disbursement not later than 2:00 P.M., New York City time, on 
the date that such LC Disbursement is made, if the Borrower has received 
notice of such LC Disbursement prior to 12:00 Noon, New York City time, on 
such date, or, if such notice has not been received by the Borrower prior 
to such time on such date, then not later than 2:00 P.M., New York City 
time, on (i) the Business Day that the Borrower receives such notice, if 
such notice is received prior to 12:00 Noon, New York City time, on the day 
of receipt, or (ii) the Business Day immediately following the day that the 
Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is not received prior to such 
time on the day of receipt; provided that if such LC Disbursement is not 
less than $1,000,000, the Borrower shall, subject to the conditions to 
borrowing set forth herein, be deemed to have requested, and the Borrower 
does hereby request under such circumstances, that such payment be financed 
with an ABR Loan in an equivalent amount and, to the extent so financed, 
the Borrower’s obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and 
replaced by the resulting ABR Loan. If the Borrower fails to make such 
payment when due, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the 
applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from the Borrower in 
respect thereof and such Lender’s Applicable Percentage thereof. Promptly 
following receipt of such notice, each Lender shall pay to the 
Administrative Agent its Applicable Percentage of the payment then due from 
the Borrower, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.2 with respect to 
Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.2 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, 
to the payment obligations of the Lenders), and the Administrative Agent 
shall promptly pay to the applicable Issuing Lender the amounts so received 
by it from the Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the Administrative 
Agent of any payment from the Borrower pursuant to this Section 3.6, the 
Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the applicable 
Issuing Lender or, to the extent that Lenders have made payments pursuant 
to this Section 3.6 to reimburse such Issuing Lender, then to such Lenders 
and the applicable Issuing Lender as their interests may appear. Any 
payment made by a Lender pursuant to this Section 3.6 to reimburse an 
Issuing Lender for any LC Disbursement (other than the funding of ABR Loans 
as contemplated above) shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve 
the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement.


Section 3.7    Obligations Absolute. The Borrower’s obligation to reimburse 
LC Disbursements as provided in Section 3.6 shall be absolute, 
unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in 
accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances 
whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability 
of any Letter of Credit, any Letter of Credit Agreement or this Agreement, 
or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document 
presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or 
invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate 
in any respect, (iii) payment by any Issuing Lender under a Letter of 
Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not 
comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit or any Letter of Credit 
Agreement, or (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or 
not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of 
this Section 3.7 constitute a legal or equitable discharge of,




46
------------------------------------------------------------------------


or provide a right of setoff against, the Borrower’s obligations hereunder. 
Neither the Administrative Agent, the Lenders nor any Issuing Lender, nor 
any of their related parties shall have any liability or responsibility by 
reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of 
Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder 
(irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding 
sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in 
transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under 
or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to 
make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms 
or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of any Issuing 
Lender; provided that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse any 
Issuing Lender from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct 
damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which 
are hereby waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable 
law) suffered by the Borrower that are caused by such Issuing Lender’s 
failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other 
documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. 
The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence 
or willful misconduct on the part of an Issuing Lender (as finally 
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), each such Issuing Lender 
shall be deemed to have exercised all requisite care in each such 
determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the 
generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents 
presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with 
the terms of a Letter of Credit, any Issuing Lender may, in its sole 
discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without 
responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or 
information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such 
documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of 
such Letter of Credit.


Section 3.8    Disbursement Procedures. Each Issuing Lender shall, promptly 
following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to 
represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. Each Issuing 
Lender shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower by 
telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether 
such Issuing Lender has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; 
provided that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not 
relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such Issuing Lender and 
the Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement.


Section 3.9    Interim Interest. If an Issuing Lender shall make any LC 
Disbursement, then, until the Borrower shall have reimbursed such Issuing 
Lender for such LC Disbursement (either with its own funds or a borrowing 
under Section 3.6), the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each 
day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but 
excluding the date that the Borrower reimburses such LC Disbursement 
(either with its own funds or a borrowing under Section 3.6), at the rate 
per annum then applicable to ABR Loans. Interest accrued pursuant to this 
Section 3.9 shall be for the account of such Issuing Lender, except that 
interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Lender pursuant to 
Section 3.6 (excluding any payment made in connection with any ABR Loans 
deemed to be made by the Borrower in accordance with Section 3.6) to 
reimburse such Issuing Lender shall be for the account of such Lender to 
the extent of such payment.


Section 3.10    Cash Collateralization. If (a) any Event of Default shall 
occur and be continuing, on the Business Day that the Borrower receives 
notice from the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if the 
maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, Lenders with LC Exposure 
representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure) demanding the 
deposit of cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph or (b) the Borrower 
is required to cash collateralize pursuant to Section 2.18 as a result of a 
Defaulting Lender, the Borrower shall deposit on terms and in accounts 
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, in the name of the Administrative 
Agent and for the benefit of the Lenders, an amount in cash equal to the LC 
Exposure as of such date plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon; 
provided that the obligation to deposit such cash




47
------------------------------------------------------------------------


collateral shall become effective immediately, and such deposit shall 
become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice of any 
kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to the 
Borrower described in Section 8.1(f). Funds so deposited shall be applied 
by the Administrative Agent to reimburse each Issuing Lender for LC 
Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not 
so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of outstanding Reimbursement 
Obligations or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but 
subject to the consent of Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater 
than 50% of the total LC Exposure), be applied to satisfy other Obligations 
of the Borrower under this Agreement. If the Borrower is required to 
provide an amount of cash collateral under this Section 3.10 as a result of 
the occurrence of an Event of Default, pursuant to Section 2.18 as a result 
of a Defaulting Lender, such amount plus any accrued interest or realized 
profits with respect to such amounts (to the extent not applied as 
aforesaid) shall be returned to the Borrower within three Business Days 
after all Events of Default have been cured or waived or the events giving 
rise to such cash collateralization under Section 2.18 have been satisfied 
or resolved.


Section 3.11    Additional Issuing Lenders. The Borrower may, at any time 
and from time to time, designate one or more additional Lenders to act as 
an Issuing Lender under the terms of this Agreement, with the consent of 
the Administrative Agent (which consent shall not be unreasonably 
withheld), each Issuing Lender and such Lender(s). Any Lender designated as 
an Issuing Lender pursuant to this Section shall have all the rights and 
obligations of each other Issuing Lender under the Loan Documents with 
respect to Letters of Credit issued or to be issued by it, and all 
references in the Loan Documents to the term “Issuing Lender” shall, with 
respect to such Letters of Credit, be deemed to refer to such Lender in its 
capacity as an Issuing Lender, as the context shall require. Furthermore, 
at any time in which there is more than one Issuing Lender hereunder, each 
reference to the term “the Issuing Lender” (or any other such phrasing 
nominally referring to the Issuing Lender as a single Person) wherever it 
appears in the Loan Documents shall be deemed to be a reference to all 
Issuing Lenders hereunder, collectively, at such time. The Administrative 
Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such additional Issuing Lender. If at 
any time there is more than one Issuing Lender hereunder, the Borrower may, 
in its discretion, select which Issuing Lender is to issue any particular 
Letter of Credit.


Section 3.12    Resignation of an Issuing Lender. Any Issuing Lender may 
resign as an Issuing Lender hereunder at any time upon at least 30 days’ 
prior notice to the Lenders, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower. At 
the time any such resignation of such Issuing Lender shall become 
effective, the Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account 
of the retiring Issuing Lender pursuant to Section 3.3. From and after the 
effective date of any such resignation or replacement, (i) the successor 
Issuing Lender shall have all the rights and obligations of each other 
Issuing Lender under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be 
issued by it thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term “Issuing 
Lender” shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous 
Issuing Lender, or to such successor and all previous Issuing Lenders, as 
the context shall require. After the resignation or replacement of an 
Issuing Lender, the replaced Issuing Lender shall remain a party hereto and 
shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Lender 
under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior 
to such resignation or replacement, but shall not be required to issue 
additional Letters of Credit.


ARTICLE 4
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES


To induce the Administrative Agent and the Lenders to enter into this 
Agreement and to make the Loans and issue or participate in the Letters of 
Credit, the Borrower hereby represents and warrants to the Administrative 
Agent and each Lender that:


Section 4.1    Financial Condition. The audited consolidated balance sheets 
of the Borrower and




48
------------------------------------------------------------------------


its consolidated Restricted Subsidiaries as at December 31, 2014, December 
31, 2015 and December 31, 2016, and the related consolidated statements of 
income and of cash flows for the fiscal years ended on such dates, reported 
on by and accompanied by a report from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, present 
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial condition of 
the Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries as at such dates, and the 
consolidated results of its operations and its consolidated cash flows for 
the respective fiscal years then ended. All such financial statements, 
including the related schedules and notes thereto, have been prepared in 
accordance with GAAP applied consistently throughout the periods involved 
(except as approved by the aforementioned firm of accountants and disclosed 
therein). As of the Closing Date, no Group Member has any material 
Guarantee Obligations, contingent liabilities and liabilities for taxes, or 
any material long term leases or unusual forward or long term commitments, 
including any interest rate or foreign currency swap or exchange 
transaction or other obligation in respect of derivatives, that are not 
reflected in the most recent financial statements referred to in this 
paragraph (or in the notes thereto) or, in the case of material long term 
leases, as described in Schedule 4.1. During the period from December 31, 
2016 to and including the date hereof there has been no Disposition by any 
Group Member of any material part of its business or property other than as 
disclosed in writing to the Administrative Agent.


Section 4.2    No Change. Since December 31, 2016, there has been no 
development or event that has had or could reasonably be expected to have a 
Material Adverse Effect.


Section 4.3    Existence; Compliance with Law. Each Group Member (a) is 
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the 
jurisdiction of its organization, (b) (i) has the power and authority, and 
(ii) the legal right, to own and operate its property, to lease the 
property it operates as lessee and to conduct the business in which it is 
currently engaged, (c) is duly qualified as a foreign corporation or other 
organization and in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction where 
its ownership, lease or operation of property or the conduct of its 
business requires such qualification and (d) is in compliance with all 
Requirements of Law, except in each case referred to in clause (b)(ii), (c) 
and (d), to the extent that the failure to do so could not, in the 
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.


Section 4.4    Power; Authorization; Enforceable Obligations. Each Loan 
Party has the power and authority, and the legal right, to make, deliver 
and perform the Loan Documents to which it is a party and, in the case of 
the Borrower, to obtain extensions of credit hereunder. Each Loan Party has 
taken all necessary organizational action to authorize the execution, 
delivery and performance of the Loan Documents to which it is a party and, 
in the case of the Borrower, to authorize the extensions of credit on the 
terms and conditions of this Agreement. No consent or authorization of, 
filing with, notice to or other act by or in respect of, any Governmental 
Authority or any other Person is required in connection with the extensions 
of credit hereunder or with the execution, delivery, performance, validity 
or enforceability of this Agreement or any of the Loan Documents, except 
(a) consents, authorizations, filings and notices that have been obtained 
or made and are in full force and effect, except as set forth in Schedule 
6.12(b), and (b) the filings referred to in Section 4.20. Each Loan 
Document has been duly executed and delivered on behalf of each Loan Party 
party thereto. This Agreement constitutes, and each other Loan Document 
upon execution will constitute, a legal, valid and binding obligation of 
each Loan Party party thereto, enforceable against each such Loan Party in 
accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by 
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar 
laws affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights generally and by 
general equitable principles (whether enforcement is sought by proceedings 
in equity or at law).


Section 4.5    No Legal Bar. The execution, delivery and performance of 
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, the issuance of Letters of 
Credit, the borrowings hereunder and the use of the proceeds thereof will 
not violate any Requirement of Law or any Contractual Obligation of any 
Group Member and will not result in, or require, the creation or imposition 
of any Lien on any of their respective properties or




49
------------------------------------------------------------------------


revenues pursuant to any Requirement of Law or any such Contractual 
Obligation (other than the Liens created by the Security Documents). No 
Requirement of Law or Contractual Obligation applicable to the Borrower or 
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries related to the execution, delivery and 
performance of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents could reasonably 
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.


Section 4.6    Litigation. Except as set forth in Schedule 4.6, no 
litigation, investigation or proceeding of or before any arbitrator or 
Governmental Authority is pending or, to the knowledge the Borrower, 
threatened in writing by or against any Group Member or against any of 
their respective properties or revenues (a) with respect to any of the Loan 
Documents or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, or (b) 
that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.


Section 4.7    No Default. No Group Member is in default under or with 
respect to any of its Contractual Obligations in any respect that could 
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. No Default or 
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.


Section 4.8    Ownership of Property; Liens. Each Group Member has title in 
fee simple to, a valid easement estate in, or a valid leasehold interest 
in, as the case may be, all its real property, and good title to, or a 
valid leasehold interest in, all its other property, other than minor 
defects in title that, individually or in the aggregate, could not 
reasonably be expected to cause a Material Adverse Effect, subject in each 
case only to Customary Permitted Liens.


Section 4.9    Intellectual Property. Each Group Member owns, or is 
licensed to use, all material Intellectual Property necessary for the 
conduct of its business as currently conducted. No material claim has been 
asserted and is pending by any Person challenging or questioning the use of 
any such material Intellectual Property or the validity or effectiveness of 
any such material Intellectual Property, nor does the Borrower know of any 
valid basis for any such claim that could reasonably be expected to have a 
Material Adverse Effect. The use of such material Intellectual Property by 
each Group Member does not infringe in any material respect on the rights 
of any Person in any material respect.


Section 4.10    Taxes. Each Group Member has filed or caused to be filed 
all Federal, state income or franchise and other material Tax returns that 
are required to be filed by it (or any extension has been obtained for the 
filing thereof) and has paid all Taxes shown to be due and payable by it on 
said returns or on any assessments of Tax made against it or any of its 
property and all other Taxes, fees or other charges imposed on it or any of 
its property by any Governmental Authority (other than (a) any Taxes the 
amount or validity of which are currently being contested in good faith by 
appropriate proceedings and with respect to which reserves in conformity 
with GAAP have been provided on the books of the relevant Group Member, or 
(b) to the extent that the failure to do so, individually or in the 
aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse 
Effect); no material Tax Lien has been filed, and, to the knowledge of the 
Borrower, no material claim is being asserted, with respect to any such 
Tax, fee or other charge.


Section 4.11    Federal Regulations. No part of the proceeds of any Loans, 
and no other extensions of credit hereunder, will be used (a) for “buying” 
or “carrying” any “margin stock” within the respective meanings of each of 
the quoted terms under Regulation U as now and from time to time hereafter 
in effect for any purpose that violates the provisions of the Regulations 
of the Board or (b) for any purpose that violates the provisions of the 
Regulations of the Board. If requested by any Lender or the Administrative 
Agent, the Borrower will furnish to the Administrative Agent and each 
Lender a statement to the foregoing effect in conformity with the 
requirements of FR Form G-3 or FR Form U 1, as applicable, referred to in 
Regulation U.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


Section 4.12    Labor Matters. Except as, in the aggregate, could not 
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect: (a) there are no 
strikes or other labor disputes against any Group Member pending or, to the 
knowledge of the Borrower, threatened; (b) hours worked by and payment made 
to employees of each Group Member have not been in violation of the Fair 
Labor Standards Act or any other applicable Requirement of Law dealing with 
such matters; and (c) all payments due from any Group Member on account of

each of their respective ERISA Affiliates is in compliance with the 
applicable provisions of ERISA and the provisions of the Code relating to 
Plans and the regulations and published interpretations thereunder; (ii) no 
ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably expected to occur; and (iii) all 
amounts required by applicable law with respect to, or by the terms of, any 
retiree welfare benefit arrangement maintained by any Group Member or any 
ERISA Affiliate or to which any Group Member or any ERISA Affiliate has an 
obligation to contribute have been accrued in accordance with Statement of 
Financial Accounting Standards No. 106. The present value of all 
accumulated benefit obligations under each Pension Plan (based on the 
assumptions used for purposes of Statement of Financial Accounting 
Standards No. 87) did not, as of the date of the most recent financial 
statements reflecting such amounts, exceed by more than a material amount 
the fair market value of the assets of such Pension Plan allocable to such 
accrued benefits, and the present value of all accumulated benefit 
obligations of all underfunded Pension Plans (based on the assumptions used 
for purposes of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158) did 
not, as of the date of the most recent financial statements reflecting such 
amounts, exceed by more than a material amount the fair market value of the 
assets of all such underfunded Pension Plans.


(b)    Except as, in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to 
have a Material Adverse Effect, (i) all employer and employee contributions 
required by applicable law or by the terms of any Foreign Benefit 
Arrangement or Foreign Plan have been made, or, if applicable, accrued in 
accordance with normal accounting practices; (ii) the accrued benefit 
obligations of each Foreign Plan (based on those assumptions used to fund 
such Foreign Plan) with respect to all current and former participants do 
not exceed the assets of such Foreign Plan; (iii) each Foreign Plan that is 
required to be registered has been registered and has been maintained in 
good standing with applicable regulatory authorities; and (iv) each such 
Foreign Benefit Arrangement and Foreign Plan is in compliance (A) with all 
material provisions of applicable law and all material applicable 
regulations and published interpretations thereunder with respect to such 
Foreign Benefit Arrangement or Foreign Plan and (B) with the terms of such 
plan or arrangement.


Section 4.14    Investment Company Act; Other Regulations. No Loan Party is 
an “investment company”, or a company “controlled” by an “investment 
company”, within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as 
amended. No Loan Party is subject to regulation under any Requirement of 
Law (other than Regulation X of the Board) that limits its ability to incur 
Indebtedness.


Section 4.15    Subsidiaries. Except as disclosed to the Administrative 
Agent by the Borrower in writing from time to time after the Closing Date, 
(a) Schedule 4.15 sets forth the name and jurisdiction of organization of 
each Subsidiary and, as to each such Subsidiary, the percentage of each 
class of Capital Stock owned by the Borrower and each Subsidiary; (b) 
Schedule 4.15 identifies each Subsidiary as either a Restricted Subsidiary 
or an Unrestricted Subsidiary and identifies each Immaterial Subsidiary, 
and (b) there are no outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, 
rights or other agreements or commitments (other




51
------------------------------------------------------------------------


than stock options granted to employees or directors and directors’ 
qualifying shares) of any nature relating to any Capital Stock of any 
Subsidiary of the Borrower, except as created by the Loan Documents. Each 
Restricted Subsidiary of the Borrower that is a Guarantor is a Wholly Owned 
Subsidiary of the Borrower.


Section 4.16    Use of Proceeds. The proceeds of the Loans, and the Letters 
of Credit, will be used (a) for working capital and general corporate 
purposes (including to fund Capital Expenditures, Restricted Payments 
permitted by Section 7.6(d) and (e) and Permitted Acquisitions), and (b) to 
pay fees and expenses related to the Facility.


Section 4.17    Licenses, etc. Each Group Member has obtained and holds in 
full force and effect, all franchises, licenses, permits, certificates, 
authorizations, qualifications, accreditation, easements, rights of way and 
other consents and approvals which are necessary for the operation of its 
businesses as presently conducted, the absence of which is likely to have a 
Material Adverse Effect.


Section 4.18    Environmental Matters. Except as, in the aggregate, could 
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect:


(a)    each Group Member is in compliance with all, and has not violated 
any, applicable Environmental Laws, and reasonably believes that it will 
continue to comply with all requirements of Environmental Laws currently 
applicable to it and any other requirements under Environmental Laws 
currently in effect which need not be complied with until a date hereafter;


(b)    each Group Member holds all Environmental Permits (each of which is 
in full force and effect) required for its operations as currently 
conducted, and for any property owned, leased, or otherwise operated by it 
and complies with all and has not violated any such Environmental Permits, 
and reasonably believes that: each of its Environmental Permits will not be 
revoked or adversely modified and will be timely renewed in the ordinary 
course of business; and that any applications by or for it that are 
currently pending for any additional Environmental Permits will be timely 
obtained in the ordinary course of business;


(c)    except as set forth in Schedule 4.18, Materials of Environmental 
Concern are not present at, on, in or under and are not emanating from any 
real property currently or formerly owned, leased or operated by any Group 
Member (the “Properties”) or at any other location (including, without 
limitation, any location to which Materials of Environmental Concern have 
been sent for re-use or recycling or for treatment, storage, or disposal) 
which could reasonably be expected to (i) give rise to liability of any

Concern (i) to which any Group Member is or would reasonably expected to be

Party to the Administrative Agent or the Lenders, or any of them, for use 
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the 
other Loan Documents, taken as a whole, contained as of the date such 
statement, information, document or certificate was so furnished, any 
untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact 
necessary to make the statements contained herein or therein, in light of

information. The projections and pro forma financial information contained 
in the materials referenced above are based upon good faith estimates and 
assumptions believed by management of the Borrower to be reasonable at the 
time made, it being recognized by the Lenders that such financial 
information as it relates to future events is not to be viewed as fact and 
that actual results during the period or periods covered by such financial

contemplated hereby and by the other Loan Documents.


Section 4.20    Security Documents.


(a)    The Guarantee and Collateral Agreement is effective to create in 
favor of the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Secured Parties, 
a legal, valid and enforceable security interest in the Collateral 
described therein and proceeds thereof. In the case of the Pledged Stock

Collateral Agreement shall constitute a fully perfected Lien on, and 
security interest in, all right, title and interest of the Loan Parties in 
such Collateral and the proceeds thereof, as security for the Obligations, 
in each case prior and superior in right to any other Person (except, in 
the case of Collateral other than Pledged Stock, Liens permitted by 
Section 7.3).


(b)    Each of the Mortgages is effective to create in favor of the 
Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Secured Parties, a legal,

specified on Schedule 4.20 (or, in the case of any Mortgage executed and 
delivered after the Closing Date in accordance with the provisions of 
Section 6.9), when such Mortgage is filed in the offices specified in the 
local counsel opinion delivered with respect thereto in accordance with the 
provisions of Section 6.9), each such Mortgage shall constitute a fully 
perfected Lien on, and security interest in, all right, title and interest 
of the Loan Parties in the Mortgaged Properties constituting real property 
and the proceeds thereof, as security for the Obligations (as defined in 
the relevant Mortgage), in each case prior and superior in right to any 
other Person (other than Customary Permitted Liens).

Indebtedness and obligations being incurred in connection herewith will be

after giving effect to) each Credit Extension.


Section 4.22    Insurance. All insurance maintained by Group Members is in 
full force and effect, all premiums have been duly paid (or arrangements 
for payment therefor have been made), no Group Member has received notice 
of violation or cancellation thereof, the properties covered thereby, and 
the use, occupancy and operation thereof, comply in all material respects 
with all Insurance Requirements, and there exists no material default under 
any Insurance Requirement. Each Group Member has insurance in such amounts 
and covering such risks and liabilities as are customary for companies of a 
similar size engaged in similar businesses in similar locations.


Section 4.23    Flood Insurance Related Matters. Except as set forth on 
Schedule 4.23 as it may be supplemented from time to time by delivery of a 
written notice to the Administrative Agent, no Mortgage encumbers improved 
real property that contains Buildings or Manufactured (Mobile) Homes (as 
those terms are defined in applicable Flood Insurance Laws) (such real 
property, the “Improved Real Property” and to the extent listed on 
Schedule 4.23, as it may be supplemented from time to time, the “Improved 
Mortgaged Property”). The Loan Parties have obtained flood insurance in 
accordance with Section 6.5, with respect to each Improved Mortgaged 
Property that is located in a “flood hazard area” in any Flood Insurance 
Rate Map published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (or any 
successor agency).

modified in any manner, other than pursuant to amendments or modifications 
permitted pursuant to Section 7.19 and previously delivered to the 
Administrative Agent.

(a)    The Borrower has implemented and maintains in effect policies and 
procedures intended to ensure compliance by the Borrower, its Subsidiaries 
and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents (while 
acting in their capacity as agents for the Borrower or its Subsidiaries) 
with Anti-Corruption Laws and Sanctions applicable to the Borrower, its 
Subsidiaries and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents 
(while acting in their capacity as agents for the Borrower or its 
Subsidiaries).


(b)    The Borrower, its Subsidiaries, their respective officers and 
employees and, to the knowledge of the Borrower, its directors and agents 
(acting in their capacity as agents for the Borrower or its Subsidiaries) 
are in compliance with Anti-Corruption Laws and applicable Sanctions in all 
material respects and are not engaged in any activity that would reasonably 
be expected to result in any Group Member being designated as a Sanctioned 
Person.


(c)    None of (x) the Borrower, any Subsidiary or any of their respective 
directors, officers or employees, or (y) to the knowledge of the Borrower,

or benefit from the credit facility established hereby, is a Sanctioned 
Person. The Borrower will not directly or indirectly use any Letter of 
Credit or the proceeds from the Loans or lend, contribute or

Section 6.5    Insurance.


(a)    Generally. Keep its insurable property adequately insured at all 
times by financially sound and reputable insurers; maintain such other 
insurance, to such extent and against such risks as is customary with 
companies in the same or similar businesses operating in the same or 
similar locations, including insurance with respect to Mortgaged Properties 
and other properties material to the business of the Group Members against 
such casualties and contingencies and of such types and in such amounts 
with such deductibles as is customary in the case of similar businesses

any material reduction in amount or material change in coverage thereof) 
and (ii) name the Administrative Agent as mortgagee (in the case of 
property insurance)




61
------------------------------------------------------------------------


or additional insured on behalf of the Secured Parties (in the case of 
liability insurance) or loss payee (in the case of property insurance), as 
applicable; provided that, notwithstanding any such loss payee or mortgagee 
designation, so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, any payment 
under such Insurance may be made solely to the applicable Group Member for 
application as required and permitted by Section 2.6.


(c)    Notice to Agents. Notify the Administrative Agent promptly whenever 
any separate insurance concurrent in form or contributing in the event of 
loss with that required to be maintained under this Section 6.5 is taken 
out by any Group Member; and promptly deliver to the Administrative Agent a 
duplicate original copy of such policy or policies.


(d)    Flood Insurance. With respect to each parcel of Improved Mortgaged 
Property located in a “flood hazard area” in any Flood Insurance Rate Map 
published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (or any successor 
agency), obtain flood insurance in an amount not less than the outstanding 
principal amount of the Obligations that are reasonably allocable to such 
Improved Mortgaged Property or the maximum limit of coverage made available 
with respect to the particular type of property under the National Flood 
Insurance Act of 1968, and otherwise comply with the National Flood 
Insurance Program as set forth in the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 
1973, as amended from time to time, it being understood that such flood 
insurance may be obtained from private insurance companies and issued on a 
collective basis to cover all of such Improved Mortgaged Property located 
in a “flood hazard area” in any Flood Insurance Rate Map published by the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency (or any successor agency). Without 
limiting the generality of the foregoing, with respect to any Improved Real 
Property that is, or is to become subject to a Mortgage, the Borrower shall 
deliver, or cause to be delivered to, the Administrative Agent (A) a “life 
of loan” flood hazard certification from the National Research Center, or 
any successor agency thereto and, (B) if such Improved Real Property is 
located in a special flood hazard area: (i) notices to (and confirmation of 
receipt by) the applicable Loan Party as to the existence of a special 
flood hazard and, if applicable, the unavailability of flood hazard 
insurance under the National Flood Insurance Program because the community 
does not participate in the National Flood Insurance Program; and (ii) to 
the extent flood hazard insurance is available in the community in which 
the Improved Real Property is located, a copy of one of the following: (w) 
the flood hazard insurance policy, (x) the Loan Party’s application for a 
flood hazard insurance policy, together with proof of payment of the 
premium associated therewith, (y) a declaration page confirming that flood 
hazard insurance has been issued to the applicable Loan Party or (z) such 
other evidence of flood hazard insurance reasonably satisfactory to the 
Administrative Agent, which in any event, reflects flood hazard insurance 
coverage in such total amount as required by Regulation H of the Federal 
Reserve Board, as from time to time in effect and all official rulings and 
interpretations thereunder or thereof, and otherwise in compliance with the 
Flood Insurance Laws. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no 
mortgage, deed of trust, trust deed, deed to secure debt or other security 
instrument with respect to any Improved Real Property shall be executed 
until the earlier of (x) five (5) Business Days after each Regulated Lender 
Entity has received the documentation described in Section 6.5(d) above 
with respect to such Improved Real Property and (y) the date such Regulated 
Lender Entity confirms to the Administrative Agent its satisfaction with 
compliance with the Flood Insurance Laws with respect to such Improved Real 
Property (such confirmation not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or 
delayed, and to be delivered promptly upon such completion by the 
applicable Regulated Lender Entity).


(e)    Broker’s Report. Deliver to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders 
a report or reports of one or more reputable insurance brokers or 
consultants with respect to such insurance and such supplemental reports 
with respect thereto as the Administrative Agent may from time to time 
reasonably request.




62
------------------------------------------------------------------------


(f)    Mortgaged Properties. No Loan Party that is an owner of Mortgaged 
Property shall take any action that is reasonably likely to be the basis 
for termination, revocation or denial of any insurance coverage required to 
be maintained under such Loan Party’s respective Mortgage or that could be 
the basis for a defense to any claim under any Insurance Policy, and each 
Loan Party shall otherwise comply in all material respects with all 
Insurance Requirements; provided, however, that each Loan Party may, at its 
own expense and after written notice to the Administrative Agent, (i) 
contest the applicability or enforceability of any such Insurance 
Requirements by appropriate legal proceedings, the prosecution of which 
does not constitute a basis for cancellation or revocation of any insurance 
coverage required under this Section 6.5 or (ii) cause the Insurance Policy 
containing any such Insurance Requirement to be replaced by a new policy 
complying with the provisions of this Section 6.5.


Section 6.6    Inspection of Property; Books and Records; Discussions. (a) 
Keep proper books of records and account in which full, true and correct 
entries in conformity with GAAP shall be made of all financial transactions 
in relation to its business and activities and (b) permit representatives 
of the Administrative Agent or any Lender to visit and inspect any of its 
properties and examine and make abstracts from any of its books and records 
at any reasonable time and as often as may reasonably be desired and to 
discuss the business, operations, properties and financial and other 
condition of the Group Members with officers and employees of the Group 
Members and with their independent certified public accountants; provided, 
the Borrower shall not be obligated to reimburse the costs or expenses 
incurred by the Administrative Agent or any Lender in complying with the 
Borrower’s obligations pursuant to this Section unless a Default or an 
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.


Section 6.7    Notices. Promptly (and, in any event, within three Business 
Days after a Responsible Officer of the Borrower obtains knowledge thereof) 
give notice to the Administrative Agent and each Lender of:


(a)    the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default;


(b)    any (i) default or event of default under any Contractual Obligation 
of any Group Member or (ii) litigation, investigation or proceeding that 
may exist at any time between any Group Member and any Governmental 
Authority, that in either case, if not cured or if adversely determined, as 
the case may be, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse 
Effect;


(c)    any litigation or proceeding affecting any Group Member (i) in which 
the uninsured amount involved is $2,500,000 or more, (ii) in which 
injunctive or similar relief is sought or (iii) which relates to any Loan 
Document;


(d)    an ERISA Event that is reasonably expected to result in a liability 
to any Group Member in excess of $2,500,000;


(e)    any development or event that has had or could reasonably be 
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect;


(f)    the occurrence of a Recovery Event; and


(g)    the incurrence of any material Lien (other than Liens permitted by 
Section 7.3) on, or claim asserted against any of the Collateral or (ii) 
the occurrence of any other event which could materially detract from the 
value of the Collateral.




63
------------------------------------------------------------------------


Each notice pursuant to this Section 6.7 shall be accompanied by a 
statement of a Responsible Officer setting forth details of the occurrence 
referred to therein and stating what action the relevant Group Member 
proposes to take with respect thereto.

reasonable efforts to prevent any other Person from generating, using, 
treating, storing, releasing, transporting, disposing of, or otherwise 
managing Materials of Environmental Concern in a manner that could 
reasonably be expected to result in a liability to, or adversely affect any 
real property owned or operated by, any Group Member; it being understood 
that this paragraph (a) shall be deemed not breached by a noncompliance 
with any of the foregoing (i) or (ii) provided that, upon learning of such 
noncompliance or any condition that results from such noncompliance, any 
affected Group Member promptly develops and diligently implements a 
response to such noncompliance and any such condition that is consistent 
with principles of commercially reasonable prudent environmental management 
and all applicable Environmental Laws, and provided further that such 
response and condition, in the aggregate with any other such responses and 
conditions, could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse 
Effect.


(b)    Conduct and complete all investigations, studies, sampling and 
testing, and all remedial, removal and other actions required under 
applicable Environmental Laws and promptly comply in all material respects 
with all orders and directives of all Governmental Authorities regarding

cause the execution, acknowledgement and delivery of, and thereafter 
register, file or record, or cause to be registered, filed or recorded, in

Section 6.10    Commodity Exchange Act Keepwell Provisions.  The Borrower 
hereby guarantees the payment and performance of all Obligations of each 
Loan Party (other than Borrower) and absolutely, unconditionally and 
irrevocably undertakes to provide such funds or other support as may be 
needed from time to time to each Loan Party (other than the Borrower) in 
order for such Loan Party to honor its obligations under the Guarantee and 
Collateral Agreement including obligations with respect to Swap Agreements 
(provided, however, that the Borrower shall only be liable under this 
Section 6.10 for the maximum amount of such liability that can be hereby 
incurred without rendering its obligations under this Section 6.10, or 
otherwise under this Agreement or any Loan Document, as it relates to such 
other Loan Parties, voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent 
conveyance or fraudulent transfer, and not for any greater amount). The 
obligations of the Borrower under this Section 6.10 shall remain in full 
force and effect until all Obligations are paid in full to the Lenders, the 
Administrative Agent and all other Secured Parties, and all of the Lenders’ 
Commitments are terminated. The Borrower intends that this Section 6.10 
constitute, and this Section 6.10 shall be deemed to constitute, a 
“keepwell, support, or other agreement” for the benefit of each other Loan 
Party for all purposes of Section 1a(18)(A)(v)(II) of the Commodity 
Exchange Act.


Section 6.11    Designation and Conversion of Restricted and Unrestricted 
Subsidiaries.


(a)    Unless designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary on Schedule 4.15 as 
of the Closing Date or thereafter, assuming compliance with Section 6.11(b)
, any Person that becomes a Subsidiary of the Borrower or any of its 
Restricted Subsidiaries shall be classified as a Restricted Subsidiary.


(b)    The Borrower may designate by prior written notice thereof to the 
Administrative Agent, any Restricted Subsidiary, including a newly formed 
or newly acquired Subsidiary, as an Unrestricted Subsidiary if immediately 
prior, and after giving effect, to such designation, (i) (A) the 
representations and




66
------------------------------------------------------------------------


warranties of the Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries contained in 
each of the Loan Documents are true and correct in all material respects on 
and as of such date as if made on and as of the date of such redesignation 
(or, if stated to have been made expressly as of an earlier date, were true 
and correct in all material respects as of such date), and (B) no Default 
or Event of Default exists or would exist (and the Borrower shall be in 
compliance, on a Pro Forma Basis, with the covenants set forth in Section 
7.1); and (ii) the Investment deemed to be made in such Subsidiary pursuant 
to the next sentence would be permitted to be made at the time of such 
designation under Section 7.7(e). The designation of any Restricted 
Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary shall constitute an Investment in 
an Unrestricted Subsidiary in an amount equal to the fair market value of 
the Borrower’s direct and indirect ownership interest in such Subsidiary. 
Except as provided in this Section 6.11(b), no Restricted Subsidiary may be 
redesignated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary.


(c)    The Borrower may designate by prior written notice thereof to the 
Administrative Agent any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted 
Subsidiary if immediately prior, and after giving effect to such 
designation, (i) (A) the representations and warranties of the Borrower and 
its Restricted Subsidiaries contained in each of the Loan Documents are 
true and correct in all material respects on and as of such date as if made 
on and as of the date of such redesignation (or, if stated to have been 
made expressly as of an earlier date, were true and correct in all material 
respects as of such date), (ii) no Default or Event of Default exists or 
would exist (and the Borrower shall be in compliance, on a Pro Forma Basis, 
with the covenants set forth in Section 7.1) and (ii) the Borrower is in 
compliance with the requirements of Section 6.9 and Section 7.18. Any such 
designation shall (x) be treated as a cash dividend in an amount equal to 
the lesser of the fair market value of the Borrower’s direct and indirect 
ownership interest in such Subsidiary or the amount of the Borrower’s cash 
investment previously made for purposes of the limitation on Investments 
under Section 7.7(e) and (y) constitute the incurrence at the time of such 
designation of any Investment, Indebtedness or Liens of such Subsidiary 
existing at such time.


(d)    The Borrower will cause the management, business and affairs of each 
Group Member to be conducted in such a manner (including, without 
limitation, by keeping separate books of account, furnishing separate 
financial statements of Unrestricted Subsidiaries to creditors and 
potential creditors thereof and by not permitting Properties of the Group 
Members to be commingled) so that each Unrestricted Subsidiary that is a 
corporation will be treated as a corporate entity separate and distinct 
from each Group Member.


Section 6.12    Post Closing Matters. Execute and deliver the documents and 
complete the tasks set forth on Schedule 6.12, in each case within the time 
limits specified on such schedule.


Section 6.13    Accounts. Each Loan Party shall:


(a)    from and after the 30th day following the Closing Date (as such date 
may be extended by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion from 
time to time) cause all of its deposit accounts, securities accounts and 
commodity accounts, other than Excluded Accounts, to be subject to Account 
Control Agreements; and


(b)    upon the request of the Administrative Agent, promptly provide a 
schedule of the deposit accounts, securities accounts and commodity 
accounts of the Loan Parties together with such other information in 
respect of such accounts as the Administrative Agent may reasonably 
request.


Section 6.14    Anti-Corruption Laws and Sanctions.




67
------------------------------------------------------------------------


(a)    Implement and maintain in effect policies and procedures intended to 
ensure compliance by the Borrower, its Subsidiaries and their respective 
directors, officers, employees and agents (while acting in their capacity 
as agents for the Borrower or its Subsidiaries) with Anti-Corruption Laws 
and Sanctions applicable to the Borrower, its Subsidiaries and their 
respective directors, officers, employees and agents (while acting in their 
capacity as agents for the Borrower or its Subsidiaries).


(b)    Comply with Anti-Corruption Laws and applicable Sanctions in all 
material respects and conduct any and all activities such that no activity 
of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries would reasonably be expected to 
result in any Group Member being designated as a Sanctioned Person.


(c)    Ensure that the proceeds from the Loans are not used for the purpose 
of financing the activities of any Sanctioned Person in violation of 
Sanctions, and ensure that the proceeds are not lent, contributed or 
otherwise made available to any Subsidiary, joint venture partner or other 
Person for the purpose of financing the activities of any Sanctioned Person 
in violation of Sanctions.

agent on behalf of such holder or beneficiary) to cause, with the giving of 
notice if required, such Indebtedness to become due prior to its stated 
maturity or (in the case of any such Indebtedness constituting a Guarantee

such entity does not have reasonable grounds for contesting such Withdrawal

appropriate manner; or (iv) any other event or condition shall occur or 
exist with respect to a Plan; and in each case in clauses (i) through (iv) 
above, such event or condition, together with all other such events or 
conditions, if any, could, in the sole judgment of the Required Lenders, 
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect; or


(h)    one or more judgments or decrees shall be entered against (or any 
valid and binding settlement agreement shall be entered into by) any Group 
Member involving in the aggregate a liability (to the extent not paid by

full force and effect, or any Loan Party or any Affiliate of any Loan Party

78
------------------------------------------------------------------------


(k)    any Change of Control shall occur;


then, and in any such event, (A) if such event is an Event of Default 
specified in clause (i) or (ii) of paragraph (f) above with respect to the 
Borrower or the General Partner, automatically the Commitments shall 
immediately terminate and the Loans (with accrued interest thereon) and all 
other amounts owing under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents 
(including all amounts of LC Exposure, whether or not the beneficiaries of 
the then outstanding Letters of Credit shall have presented the documents 
required thereunder) shall immediately become due and payable, and (B) if 
such event is any other Event of Default, either or both of the following 
actions may be taken: (i) with the consent of the Required Lenders, the 
Administrative Agent may, or upon the request of the Required Lenders, the 
Administrative Agent shall, by notice to the Borrower declare the 
Commitments to be terminated forthwith, whereupon the Commitments shall 
immediately terminate; and (ii) with the consent of the Required Lenders, 
the Administrative Agent may, or upon the request of the Required Lenders, 
the Administrative Agent shall, by notice to the Borrower, declare the 
Loans (with accrued interest thereon) and all other amounts owing under 
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents (including all amounts of LC 
Exposure, whether or not the beneficiaries of the then outstanding Letters 
of Credit shall have presented the documents required thereunder) to be due 
and payable forthwith, whereupon the same shall immediately become due and 
payable. With respect to all Letters of Credit with respect to which 
presentment for honor shall not have occurred at the time of an 
acceleration pursuant to this paragraph, the Borrower shall at such time 
deposit in a cash collateral account opened by the Administrative Agent an 
amount equal to the aggregate then undrawn and unexpired amount of such 
Letters of Credit. Amounts held in such cash collateral account shall be 
applied by the Administrative Agent to the payment of drafts drawn under 
such Letters of Credit, and the unused portion thereof after all such 
Letters of Credit shall have expired or been fully drawn upon, if any, 
shall be applied to repay other Obligations of the Borrower hereunder and 
under the other Loan Documents. After all such Letters of Credit shall have 
expired or been fully drawn upon or otherwise terminated or back-stopped to 
the applicable Issuing Lender’s satisfaction, all Reimbursement Obligations 
shall have been satisfied and all other Obligations of the Borrower 
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents shall have been paid in full, 
the balance, if any, in such cash collateral account shall be returned to 
the Borrower (or such other Person as may be lawfully entitled thereto). 
Except as expressly provided above in this Section, presentment, demand, 
protest and all other notices of any kind are hereby expressly waived by 
the Borrower.


Section 8.2    Application of Proceeds. The proceeds received by the 
Administrative Agent in respect of any sale of, collection from or other 
realization upon all or any part of the Collateral pursuant to the exercise 
by the Administrative Agent of its remedies shall be applied, in full or in 
part, together with any other sums then held by the Administrative Agent 
pursuant to this Agreement, promptly by the Administrative Agent as 
follows:


(a)    First, to the payment of all reasonable costs and expenses, fees, 
commissions and taxes of such sale, collection or other realization 
including compensation to the Administrative Agent and its agents and 
counsel, and all expenses, liabilities and advances made or incurred by the 
Administrative Agent in connection therewith, and all fees payable to the 
Administrative Agent, and all amounts for which the Administrative Agent is 
entitled to indemnification, in each case pursuant to the provisions of any 
Loan Document (including, without limitation, pursuant to Section 10.5), 
together with interest on each such amount at the highest rate then in 
effect under this Agreement from and after the date such amount is due, 
owing or unpaid until paid in full;




79
------------------------------------------------------------------------


(b)    Second, to the payment of all other reasonable costs and expenses of 
such sale, collection or other realization including compensation to the 
other Secured Parties and their agents and counsel and all costs, 
liabilities and advances made or incurred by the other Secured Parties in 
connection therewith, in each case pursuant to the provisions of any Loan 
Document, together with interest on each such amount at the highest rate 
then in effect under this Agreement from and after the date such amount is 
due, owing or unpaid until paid in full;


(c)    Third, without duplication of amounts applied pursuant to clauses 
(a) and (b) above, to the indefeasible payment in full in cash, pro rata, 
of interest and other amounts constituting Obligations (other than 
principal, Reimbursement Obligations and obligations to cash collateralize 
Letters of Credit) and any fees, premiums and scheduled periodic payments 
due under Specified Swap Agreements or Specified Cash Management Agreements 
constituting Obligations and any interest accrued thereon, in each case 
equally and ratably in accordance with the respective amounts thereof then 
due and owing;


(d)    Fourth, to the indefeasible payment in full in cash, pro rata, of 
principal amount of the Obligations and any premium thereon (including 
Reimbursement Obligations and obligations to cash collateralize Letters of 
Credit) and any breakage, termination or other payments under Specified 
Swap Agreements and Specified Cash Management Agreements constituting 
Obligations and any interest accrued thereon; and


(e)    Fifth, the balance, if any, to the Person lawfully entitled thereto 
(including the applicable Loan Party or its successors or assigns) or as a 
court of competent jurisdiction may direct.


Notwithstanding the foregoing, amounts received from the Borrower or any 
Guarantor that is not an “eligible contract participant” under the 
Commodity Exchange Act shall not be applied to any Excluded Swap 
Obligations (it being understood, that in the event that any amount is 
applied to Indebtedness other than Excluded Swap Obligations as a result of 
this clause, the Administrative Agent shall make such adjustments as it 
determines are appropriate to distributions pursuant to clause third or 
fourth above from amounts received from “eligible contract participants” 
under the Commodity Exchange Act to ensure, as nearly as possible, that the 
proportional aggregate recoveries with respect to Indebtedness described in 
clause third or fourth above, as applicable, by the holders of any Excluded 
Swap Obligations are the same as the proportional aggregate recoveries with 
respect to other Indebtedness pursuant to clause third or fourth above, as 
applicable).



ARTICLE 9
THE AGENTS


Section 9.1    Appointment. Each Lender hereby irrevocably designates and 
appoints the Administrative Agent as the agent of such Lender under this 
Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and each such Lender irrevocably 
authorizes the Administrative Agent, in such capacity, to take such action 
on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan 
Documents and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are 
expressly delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms of this 
Agreement and the other Loan Documents, together with such other powers as 
are reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any provision to the 
contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall not 
have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth 
herein, or any fiduciary relationship with any Lender, and no implied 
covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities 
shall be read into this Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise 
exist against the Administrative Agent.




80
------------------------------------------------------------------------


Section 9.2    Delegation of Duties. The Administrative Agent may execute 
any of its duties under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents by or 
through agents or attorneys in fact and shall be entitled to advice of 
counsel concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. The 
Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or 
misconduct of any agents or attorneys in fact selected by it with 
reasonable care.


Section 9.3    Exculpatory Provisions. Neither any Agent nor any of their 
respective Related Parties shall be (a) liable for any action lawfully 
taken or omitted to be taken by it or such Person under or in connection 
with this Agreement or any other Loan Document (except to the extent that 
any of the foregoing are found by a final and nonappealable decision of a 
court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from its or such Person’s 
own gross negligence or willful misconduct) or (b) responsible in any 
manner to any of the Lenders for any recitals, statements, representations 
or warranties made by any Loan Party or any officer thereof contained in 
this Agreement or any other Loan Document or in any certificate, report, 
statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by 
the Agents under or in connection with, this Agreement or any other Loan 
Document or for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness, 
enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Loan Document 
or for any failure of any Loan Party a party thereto to perform its 
obligations hereunder or thereunder. The Agents shall not be under any 
obligation to any Lender to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or 
performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, this 
Agreement or any other Loan Document, or to inspect the properties, books 
or records of any Loan Party.


Section 9.4    Reliance by Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent 
shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon 
any instrument, writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate, 
affidavit, letter, telecopy or email message, statement, order or other 
document or conversation believed by it to be genuine and correct and to 
have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons and upon 
advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to the Borrower), 
independent accountants and other experts selected by the Administrative 
Agent. The Administrative Agent may deem and treat the payee of any Note as 
the owner thereof for all purposes unless a written notice of assignment, 
negotiation or transfer thereof shall have been filed with the 
Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in 
failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement or any other 
Loan Document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of 
the Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all Lenders) 
as it deems appropriate or it shall first be indemnified to its 
satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense that 
may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such 
action. The Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in 
acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement and the other 
Loan Documents in accordance with a request of the Required Lenders (or, if 
so specified by this Agreement, all Lenders), and such request and any 
action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all 
the Lenders and all future holders of the Loans.


Section 9.5    Notice of Default. The Administrative Agent shall not be 
deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or 
Event of Default unless the Administrative Agent has received notice from a 
Lender or the Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing such Default 
or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a “notice of default”. 
In the event that the Administrative Agent receives such a notice, the 
Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Lenders. The 
Administrative Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or 
Event of Default as shall be reasonably directed by the Required Lenders 
(or, if so specified by this Agreement, all Lenders); provided that unless 
and until the Administrative Agent has received such directions, the 
Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, 
or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event 
of Default as it shall deem advisable in the best interests of the Lenders.




81
------------------------------------------------------------------------


Section 9.6    Non-Reliance on Agents and Other Lenders. Each Lender 
expressly acknowledges that neither the Agents nor any of their respective 
officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors, attorneys in fact or 
affiliates have made any representations or warranties to it and that no 
act by any Agent hereafter taken, including any review of the affairs of a 
Loan Party or any affiliate of a Loan Party, shall be deemed to constitute 
any representation or warranty by any Agent to any Lender. Each Lender 
represents to the Agents that it has, independently and without reliance 
upon any Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and 
information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and 
investigation into the business, operations, property, financial and other 
condition and creditworthiness of the Loan Parties and their affiliates and 
made its own decision to make its Loans hereunder and enter into this 
Agreement. Each Lender also represents that it will, independently and 
without reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender, and based on such 
documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, 
continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in 
taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan 
Documents, and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform 
itself as to the business, operations, property, financial and other 
condition and creditworthiness of the Loan Parties and their affiliates. 
Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be 
furnished to the Lenders by the Administrative Agent hereunder, the 
Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide 
any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business, 
operations, property, condition (financial or otherwise), prospects or 
creditworthiness of any Loan Party or any affiliate of a Loan Party that 
may come into the possession of the Administrative Agent or any of its 
officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors, attorneys in fact or 
affiliates.


Section 9.7    Indemnification. Without limiting the obligations of the 
Lenders under Section 10.5, the Lenders agree to indemnify each Agent and 
each Related Party of such Person (each, an “Agent Indemnitee”) (to the 
extent not reimbursed by the Borrower and without limiting the obligation 
of the Borrower to do so), ratably according to their respective Aggregate 
Exposure Percentages in effect on the date on which indemnification is 
sought under this Section (or, if indemnification is sought after the date 
upon which the Commitments shall have terminated and the Loans shall have 
been paid in full, ratably in accordance with such Aggregate Exposure 
Percentages immediately prior to such date), from and against any and all 
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, 
suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever that may at 
any time (whether before or after the payment of the Loans) be imposed on, 
incurred by or asserted against such Agent Indemnitee in any way relating 
to or arising out of, the Commitments, this Agreement, any of the other 
Loan Documents or any documents contemplated by or referred to herein or 
therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any action 
taken or omitted by such Agent Indemnitee under or in connection with any 
of the foregoing; provided that no Lender shall be liable for the payment 
of any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, 
penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements that 
are found by a final and nonappealable decision of a court of competent 
jurisdiction to have resulted from such Agent Indemnitee’s gross negligence 
or willful misconduct. The agreements in this Section shall survive the 
termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other 
amounts payable hereunder.


Section 9.8    Agent in Its Individual Capacity. Each Agent and its 
affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from and generally engage in 
any kind of business with any Loan Party as though such Agent were not an 
Agent. With respect to its Loans made or renewed by it and with respect to 
any Letter of Credit issued or participated in by it, each Agent shall have 
the same rights and powers under this Agreement and the other Loan 
Documents as any Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not an 
Agent, and the terms “Lender” and “Lenders” shall include each Agent in its 
individual capacity.


Section 9.9    Successor Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may 
resign as Administrative Agent upon 10 days’ notice to the Lenders and the 
Borrower. If the Administrative Agent




82
------------------------------------------------------------------------


shall resign as Administrative Agent under this Agreement and the other 
Loan Documents, then the Required Lenders shall appoint from among the 
Lenders a successor agent for the Lenders, which successor agent shall 
(unless an Event of Default under Section 8.1(a) or Section 8.1(f) with 
respect to the Borrower shall have occurred and be continuing) be subject 
to approval by the Borrower (which approval shall not be unreasonably 
withheld or delayed), whereupon such successor agent shall succeed to the 
rights, powers and duties of the Administrative Agent, and the term “
Administrative Agent” shall mean such successor agent effective upon such 
appointment and approval, and the former Administrative Agent’s rights, 
powers and duties as Administrative Agent shall be terminated, without any 
other or further act or deed on the part of such former Administrative 
Agent or any of the parties to this Agreement or any holders of the Loans. 
If no successor agent has accepted appointment as Administrative Agent by 
the date that is 10 days following a retiring Administrative Agent’s notice 
of resignation (except that in the case of any Collateral and Liens held by 
the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Secured Parties under any of the 
Loan Documents, the retiring Administrative Agent shall continue to hold 
such Collateral and Liens until such time as a successor Administrative 
Agent is appointed), the retiring Administrative Agent’s resignation shall 
nevertheless thereupon become effective, and the Lenders shall assume and 
perform all of the duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder until such 
time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor agent as provided 
for above. After any retiring Administrative Agent’s resignation as 
Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Section 9.9 and of Section 
10.5 shall continue to inure to its benefit.


Section 9.10    Lead Arrangers, Co-Syndication Agents and Co-Documentation 
Agents. No Lead Arranger, Co-Syndication Agent and no Co-Documentation 
Agent shall have any duties or responsibilities hereunder in its capacity 
as such.

Loan Document, nor any terms hereof or thereof may be waived, amended, 
supplemented or modified except in accordance with the provisions of this 
Section 10.1. The Required Lenders and each Loan Party party to the 
relevant Loan Document may, or, with the written consent of the Required 
Lenders, the Administrative Agent and each Loan Party party to the relevant 
Loan Document may, from time to time, (a) enter into written amendments,

the stated rate of any interest or fee payable hereunder (except (x) in 
connection with the waiver of applicability of any post-default increase in

used in the financial covenants in this Agreement shall not constitute a 
reduction in the rate of interest or fees for purposes of this clause (i))

or extend the expiration date of any Lender’s Commitment, in each case 
without the written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby; (ii)

the Loans. In the case of any waiver, the Loan Parties, the Lenders and the 
Administrative Agent shall be restored to their former position and rights 
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, and any Default or Event of 
Default waived shall be deemed to be cured and not continuing; but no such 
waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or Event of Default, 
or impair any right consequent thereon. Notwithstanding anything to the 
contrary herein, any Loan Document may be waived, amended, supplemented or 
modified pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by 
each Loan Party party to the relevant Loan Document and the Administrative 
Agent (without the consent of any Lender) solely to cure a defect or error, 
or to grant a new Lien for the benefit of the Secured Parties or extend an 
existing Lien over additional property, or to facilitate the joinder of a 
Subsidiary as a Subsidiary Guarantor.

Section 10.3    No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies. No failure on the part of 
the Administrative Agent, any other Agent, any Issuing Lender or any Lender 
to exercise and no delay in exercising, and no course of dealing with 
respect to, any right, power or privilege, or any abandonment or 
discontinuance of steps to enforce such right, power or privilege, under 
any of the Loan Documents shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any 
single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege under 
any of the Loan Documents preclude any other or further exercise thereof or 
the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. The rights, 
remedies, powers and privileges of the Administrative Agent, any other 
Agent, any Issuing Lender and the Lenders hereunder and under the other 
Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights, 
remedies, powers and privileges that they would otherwise have (but in no

hereunder.

charges incurred by the Administrative Agent or any Lender in connection

provisions of Section 2.14(b) shall apply instead), (iii) all reasonable

with the Loans made or Letters of Credit issued hereunder, including, 
without limitation, all such out-of-pocket expenses incurred during any 
workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect of such Loans or Letters 
of Credit; provided, that the Borrower shall not have any obligation under 
this Section 10.5 in connection with any action or claims brought by one 
Secured Party solely against another Secured Party.


(b)    THE BORROWER SHALL INDEMNIFY THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, EACH OTHER 
AGENT, THE LEAD ARRANGERS, EACH ISSUING LENDER AND EACH LENDER, AND EACH 
RELATED PARTY OF ANY OF THE FOREGOING PERSONS (EACH SUCH PERSON BEING

DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR ANY AGREEMENT OR 
INSTRUMENT CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY, THE PERFORMANCE BY THE PARTIES 
HERETO OR THE PARTIES TO ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OF THEIR RESPECTIVE 
OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER OR THEREUNDER OR THE CONSUMMATION OF THE TRANSACTIONS

WITH THE TERMS OF SUCH LETTER OF CREDIT, OR (b) THE PAYMENT OF A DRAWING 
UNDER ANY LETTER OF CREDIT NOTWITHSTANDING THE NON-COMPLIANCE, NON-DELIVERY 
OR OTHER IMPROPER PRESENTATION OF THE DOCUMENTS PRESENTED IN CONNECTION 
THEREWITH, (5) ANY OTHER ASPECT OF THE LOAN DOCUMENTS, (6) THE OPERATIONS 
OF THE BUSINESS OF THE BORROWER AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES OR ANY OF THEIR

THE PRESENCE, USE, RELEASE, STORAGE, TREATMENT, DISPOSAL, GENERATION, 
THREATENED RELEASE, TRANSPORT, ARRANGEMENT FOR TRANSPORT OR ARRANGEMENT FOR 
DISPOSAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS ON OR AT ANY OF THE PROPERTIES OWNED OR

ANY OF THEIR AFFILIATES, OR (14) ANY ACTUAL OR PROSPECTIVE CLAIM, 
LITIGATION, INVESTIGATION OR PROCEEDING RELATING TO ANY OF THE FOREGOING, 
WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY AND REGARDLESS OF 
WHETHER ANY INDEMNITEE IS A PARTY THERETO, AND SUCH INDEMNITY SHALL EXTEND 
TO EACH INDEMNITEE NOTWITHSTANDING THE SOLE OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE OF 
EVERY KIND OR CHARACTER WHATSOEVER, WHETHER ACTIVE OR PASSIVE, WHETHER AN 
AFFIRMATIVE ACT OR AN OMISSION, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ALL TYPES OF 
NEGLIGENT CONDUCT IDENTIFIED IN THE RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF TORTS OF ONE OR

BY A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION BY FINAL AND NONAPPEALABLE JUDGMENT TO 
HAVE RESULTED FROM THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF SUCH 
INDEMNITEE, (y) RESULT FROM A CLAIM BROUGHT BY THE BORROWER OR ANY OTHER 
LOAN PARTY AGAINST AN INDEMNITEE FOR BREACH IN BAD FAITH OF SUCH 
INDEMNITEE’S OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER OR UNDER ANY LOAN DOCUMENT, IF THE 
BORROWER OR SUCH LOAN PARTY HAS OBTAINED A FINAL AND NONAPPEALABLE JUDGMENT 
IN ITS FAVOR ON SUCH CLAIM AS DETERMINED BY A COURT OF COMPETENT 
JURISDICTION OR (z) RESULT FROM CLAIMS SOLELY BETWEEN OR AMONG INDEMNITEES

87
------------------------------------------------------------------------


(c)    To the extent that the Borrower fails to pay any amount required to 
be paid by it to the Administrative Agent, any other Agent, the Lead 
Arrangers or any Issuing Lender under this Section, each Lender severally 
agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, such other Agent, the Lead 
Arrangers or such Issuing Lender, as the case may be, ratably according to 
its respective Aggregate Exposure Percentage (determined as of the time 
that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of 
such unpaid amount; provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified 
loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was 
incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent, such other Agent, 
the Lead Arrangers or such Issuing Lender in its capacity as such.


(d)    To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrower shall not 
assert, and hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory 
of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages 
arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement, any 
other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or 
thereby, any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof.


(e)    All amounts due under this Section 10.5 shall be payable not later 
than ten (10) days after written demand therefor. The agreements in this 
Section 10.5 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the 
repayment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.


Section 10.6    Successors and Assigns; Participations and Assignments.


(a)    The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to 
the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and 
assigns permitted hereby (including any affiliate of an Issuing Lender that 
issues any Letter of Credit), except that (i) the Borrower may not assign 
or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without 
the prior written consent of each Lender (and any attempted assignment or 
transfer by the Borrower without such consent shall be null and void) and 
(ii) no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer its rights or obligations 
hereunder except in accordance with this Section.


(b)    (i) Subject to the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(ii) below, 
any Lender may assign to one or more assignees (each, an “Assignee”) all or 
a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all 
or a portion of its Commitments and the Loans at the time owing to it) with 
the prior written consent of:


(A)    the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or 
delayed), provided that no consent of the Borrower shall be required for an 
assignment to a Lender, an affiliate of a Lender, an Approved Fund (as 
defined below) or, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, 
any other Person; provided that the Borrower shall be deemed to have 
consented to any such assignment unless it shall object thereto by written 
notice to the Administrative Agent within five Business Days after having 
received notice thereof;


(B)    the Administrative Agent;


(C)    each Issuing Lender; and


(D)    without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, no 
assignment shall be made to a prospective Assignee that bears a 
relationship to the Borrower described in Section 108(e)(4) of the Code.




88
------------------------------------------------------------------------


(ii)    Assignments shall be subject to the following additional 
conditions:


(A)    except in the case of an assignment to a Lender, an affiliate of a 
Lender or an Approved Fund or an assignment of the entire remaining amount 
of the assigning Lender’s Commitments or Loans, the amount of the 
Commitments or Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such 
assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with 
respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall 
not be less than $5,000,000 unless each of the Borrower and the 
Administrative Agent otherwise consent, provided that (1) no such consent 
of the Borrower shall be required if an Event of Default has occurred and 
is continuing and (2) such amounts shall be aggregated in respect of each 
Lender and its affiliates or Approved Funds, if any;


(B)    (1) the parties to each assignment (other than any party that is 
solely consenting thereto) shall execute and deliver to the Administrative 
Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and 
recordation fee of $3,500 and (2) the assigning Lender shall have paid in 
full any amounts owing by it to the Administrative Agent; and


(C)    the Assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the 
Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire in which the Assignee 
designates one or more credit contacts to whom all syndicate-level 
information (which may contain material non-public information about the 
Borrower and its Affiliates and their related parties or their respective 
securities) will be made available and who may receive such information in 
accordance with the assignee’s compliance procedures and applicable laws, 
including Federal and state securities laws.


For the purposes of this Section 10.6, “Approved Fund” means any Person 
(other than a natural Person) that is engaged in making, purchasing, 
holding or investing in bank loans and similar extensions of credit in the 
ordinary course of its business and that is administered or managed by (a) 
a Lender, (b) an affiliate of a Lender or (c) an entity or an affiliate of 
an entity that administers or manages a Lender.


(iii)    Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to paragraph 
(b)(iv) below, from and after the effective date specified in each 
Assignment and Assumption the Assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto 
and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and 
Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this 
Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the 
interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its 
obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and 
Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations 
under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but 
shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.13, Section 2.14
, Section 2.15 and Section 10.5). Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of 
rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this 
Section 10.6 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by 
such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance 
with paragraph (c) of this Section.


(iv)    The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of 
the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices a copy of each 
Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the 
recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments 
of, and principal amount (and stated interest) of the Loans and LC Exposure 
owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the “
Register”). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the 
Borrower, the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Lender and the Lenders 
shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to 
the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, 
notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for 
inspection by the




89
------------------------------------------------------------------------


Borrower and any Lender or Issuing Lender at any reasonable time and from 
time to time upon reasonable prior notice.


(v)    Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Assumption 
executed by an assigning Lender and an Assignee, the Assignee’s completed 
Administrative Questionnaire (unless the Assignee shall already be a Lender 
hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) 
of this Section and any written consent to such assignment required by 
paragraph (b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such 
Assignment and Assumption and record the information contained therein in 
the Register. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this 
Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this 
paragraph.


(c)    Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower or the 
Administrative Agent, sell participations to one or more banks or other 
entities (a “Participant”) in all or a portion of such Lender’s rights and 
obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its 
Commitments and the Loans owing to it); provided that (A) such Lender’s 
obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (B) such Lender 
shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the 
performance of such obligations, (C) the Borrower, the Administrative 
Agent, each Issuing Lender and the other Lenders shall continue to deal 
solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s 
rights and obligations under this Agreement, and (D) without the prior 
written consent of the Administrative Agent, no participation shall be sold 
to a prospective Participant that bears a relationship to the Borrower 
described in Section 108(e)(4) of the Code. Any agreement pursuant to which 
a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall 
retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any 
amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; 
provided that such agreement may provide that such Lender will not, without 
the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or 
waiver that (1) requires the consent of each Lender directly affected 
thereby pursuant to the proviso to the second sentence of Section 10.1 and 
(2) directly affects such Participant. The Borrower agrees that each 
Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.13, Section 2.14
 and Section 2.15 (subject to the requirements and limitations therein, 
including the requirements under Section 2.14(f) (it being understood that 
the documentation required under Section 2.14(f) shall be delivered to the 
participating Lender)) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had 
acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this 
Section; provided that such Participant (A) agrees to be subject to the 
provisions of Section 2.13, Section 2.14 and Section 2.17 as if it were an 
assignee under paragraph (b) of this Section; and (B) shall not be entitled 
to receive any greater payment under Section 2.13 or Section 2.14, with 
respect to any participation, than its participating Lender would have been 
entitled to receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a 
greater payment results from an adoption of or any change in any 
Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or application thereof or 
compliance by any Lender with any request or directive (whether or not 
having the force of law) from any central bank or other Governmental 
Authority made subsequent to the date hereof that occurs after the 
Participant acquired the applicable participation. To the extent permitted 
by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 
10.7(b) as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant shall be 
subject to Section 10.7(a) as though it were a Lender. Each Lender that 
sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of 
the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address 
of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each 
Participant's interest in the Loans or other obligations under this 
Agreement (the “Participant Register”); provided that no Lender shall have 
any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register 
to any Person (including the identity of any Participant or any information 
relating to a Participant's interest in any Commitments, Loans, Letters of 
Credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) except to the 
extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such Commitment, 
Loan, Letter of Credit or other obligation is in registered form under 
Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries 
in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and 
such Lender shall treat each Person whose




90
------------------------------------------------------------------------




name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such 
participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice 
to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in 
its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for 
maintaining a Participant Register.


(d)    Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in 
all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations 
of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to 
a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge 
or assignment of a security interest; provided that no such pledge or 
assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its 
obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or Assignee for such 
Lender as a party hereto.


(e)    The Borrower, upon receipt of written notice from the relevant 
Lender, agrees to issue Notes to any Lender requiring Notes to facilitate 
transactions of the type described in paragraph (d) above.


Section 10.7    Adjustments; Set off.


(a)    Except to the extent that this Agreement, any other Loan Document or 
a court order expressly provides for payments to be allocated to a 
particular Lender, if any Lender (a “Benefitted Lender”) shall receive any 
payment of all or part of the Obligations owing to it (other than in 
connection with an assignment made pursuant to Section 10.6), or receive 
any collateral in respect thereof (whether voluntarily or involuntarily, by 
set off, pursuant to events or proceedings of the nature referred to in 
Section 8.1(f), or otherwise), in a greater proportion than any such 
payment to or collateral received by any other Lender, if any, in respect 
of the Obligations owing to such other Lender, such Benefitted Lender shall 
purchase for cash from the other Lenders a participating interest in such 
portion of the Obligations owing to each such other Lender, or shall 
provide such other Lenders with the benefits of any such collateral, as 
shall be necessary to cause such Benefitted Lender to share the excess 
payment or benefits of such collateral ratably with each of the Lenders; 
provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment or 
benefits is thereafter recovered from such Benefitted Lender, such purchase 
shall be rescinded, and the purchase price and benefits returned, to the 
extent of such recovery, but without interest.


(b)    In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders provided by 
law, each Lender shall have the right, without notice to the Borrower, any 
such notice being expressly waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted 
by applicable law, upon any Obligations becoming due and payable by the 
Borrower (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), to 
apply to the payment of such Obligations, by setoff or otherwise, any and 
all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final), in 
any currency, and any other credits, indebtedness or claims, in any 
currency, in each case whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, 
matured or unmatured, at any time held or owing by such Lender, any 
affiliate thereof or any of their respective branches or agencies to or for 
the credit or the account of the Borrower. Each Lender agrees promptly to 
notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent after any such application 
made by such Lender, provided that the failure to give such notice shall 
not affect the validity of such application.

and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally 
agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding may be

THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A 
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF 
OR RELATING TO THE LOAN DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY 
(WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO 
(a) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY 
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, 
IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO

ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (b) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER 
PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG 
OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.


Section 10.13    Acknowledgements. The Borrower hereby acknowledges that:


(a)    it has been advised by counsel in the negotiation, execution and 
delivery of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents;


(b)    neither the Administrative Agent, nor any Issuing Lender nor any 
Lender has any fiduciary relationship with or duty to the Borrower arising 
out of or in connection with this Agreement or any of the other Loan 
Documents, and the relationship between Administrative Agent, such Issuing 
Lender and Lenders, on one hand, and the Borrower, on the other hand, in 
connection herewith or therewith is solely that of debtor and creditor; and


(c)    no joint venture is created hereby or by the other Loan Documents or 
otherwise exists by virtue of the transactions contemplated hereby among 
the Lenders or among the Borrower and the Lenders.


Section 10.14    Releases of Guarantees and Liens.


(a)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any 
other Loan Document, the Administrative Agent is hereby irrevocably 
authorized by each Lender (without requirement of notice to or consent of 
any Lender except as expressly required by Section 10.1) to take any action 
requested by the Borrower having the effect of releasing any Collateral or 
guarantee obligations (i) to the extent necessary to permit consummation of 
any transaction not prohibited by any Loan Document or that has been 
consented to in accordance with Section 10.1 or (ii) under the 
circumstances described in paragraph (b) below.


(b)    At such time as the Loans, the Reimbursement Obligations and the 
other obligations under the Loan Documents (other than contingent 
indemnification obligations and obligations under or in respect of 
Specified Swap Agreements and Specified Cash Management Agreements) shall 
have been paid in full in cash, the Commitments have been terminated and no 
Letters of Credit shall be outstanding (other than Letters of Credit that 
have been cash collateralized or otherwise backstopped in a manner 
satisfactory to the applicable Issuing Lender), the Collateral shall be 
released from the Liens created by the Security Documents, and the Security 
Documents and all obligations (other than those expressly stated to survive 
such termination) of the Administrative Agent and each Loan Party under the 
Security Documents shall terminate, all without delivery of any instrument 
or performance of any act by any Person.


(c)    In each case as specified in this Section 10.14, the Administrative 
Agent will, at the Borrower’s sole expense, execute and deliver to the 
applicable Loan Party such documents as such Loan Party may reasonably 
request to evidence the release of such item of Collateral from the 
Security Documents or to release such Subsidiary Guarantor from its 
obligations under the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement, in each case in 
accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents and this Section 10.14.


Section 10.15    Confidentiality. Each of the Administrative Agent and each 
Lender agrees to keep confidential all Information (as defined below); 
provided that nothing herein shall prevent the Administrative Agent or any 
Lender from disclosing any such Information (a) to the Administrative 
Agent, any other Lender or any affiliate thereof, (b) subject to an 
agreement to comply with the provisions of this Section, to any actual or 
prospective Transferee or any direct or indirect counterparty to any Swap 
Agreement (or any




93
------------------------------------------------------------------------


professional advisor to such counterparty), (c) to its employees, 
directors, agents, attorneys, accountants and other professional advisors 
or those of any of its affiliates (it being understood that the persons to 
whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of 
such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential), (d) 
upon the request or demand of any Governmental Authority, (e) in response 
to any order of any court or other Governmental Authority or as may 
otherwise be required pursuant to any Requirement of Law, (f) if requested 
or required to do so in connection with any litigation or similar 
proceeding, (g) that has been publicly disclosed, (h) to the National 
Association of Insurance Commissioners or any similar organization or any 
nationally recognized rating agency that requires access to information 
about a Lender’s investment portfolio in connection with ratings issued 
with respect to such Lender, (i) in connection with the exercise of any 
remedy hereunder or under any other Loan Document or (j) if agreed by the 
Borrower in its sole discretion, to any other Person. For purposes of this 
Section, “Information” means all information received from the General 
Partner or any Loan Party (or on their behalf) relating to the General 
Partner or any Loan Party or any of their respective businesses, other than 
any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent or any 
Lender on a non-confidential basis prior to such disclosure; provided that, 
in the case of such information received by the Administrative Agent or any 
Lender after the Closing Date, such information is clearly identified at 
the time of delivery as confidential.


Each Lender acknowledges that information furnished to it pursuant to this 
Agreement or the other Loan Documents may include material non-public 
information concerning the General Partner, the Borrower and its Affiliates 
and their related parties or their respective securities, and confirms that 
it has developed compliance procedures regarding the use of material 
non-public information and that it will handle such material non-public 
information in accordance with those procedures and applicable law, 
including Federal and state securities laws.


All information, including requests for waivers and amendments, furnished 
by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent pursuant to, or in the course 
of administering, this Agreement or the other Loan Documents will be 
syndicate-level information, which may contain material non-public 
information about the General Partner, the Borrower and its Affiliates and 
their related parties or their respective securities. Accordingly, each 
Lender represents to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent that it has 
identified in its Administrative Questionnaire a credit contact who may 
receive information that may contain material non-public information in 
accordance with its compliance procedures and applicable law, including 
Federal and state securities laws.


Section 10.16    USA PATRIOT Act Notice and Customer Verification. Each 
Lender that is subject to the USA PATRIOT Act and the Administrative Agent 
(for itself and not on behalf of any Lender) hereby notifies the Borrower 
that pursuant to the “know your customer” regulations and the requirements 
of the USA PATRIOT Act, they are required to obtain, verify and record 
information that identifies each Loan Party, which information includes the 
name, address and tax identification number (and other identifying 
information in the event this information is insufficient to complete 
verification) that will allow such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as 
applicable, to verify the identity of each Loan Party. This information 
must be delivered to the Lenders and the Administrative Agent no later than 
five days prior to the Closing Date and thereafter promptly upon request. 
This notice is given in accordance with the requirements of the USA PATRIOT 
Act and is effective as to the Lenders and the Administrative Agent.


Section 10.17    Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding anything herein 
to the contrary, if at any time the interest rate applicable to any Loan, 
together with all fees, charges and other amounts which are treated as 
interest on such Loan under applicable Requirements of Law (collectively, 
the “Charges”), shall exceed the maximum lawful rate (the “Maximum Rate”) 
which may be contracted for, charged, taken, received or reserved by the 
Lender holding such Loan in accordance with applicable Requirements of Law,




94
------------------------------------------------------------------------


the rate of interest payable in respect of such Loan hereunder, together 
with all Charges payable in respect thereof, shall be limited to the 
Maximum Rate and, to the extent lawful, the interest and Charges that would 
have been payable in respect of such Loan but were not payable as a result 
of the operation of this Section shall be cumulated and the interest and 
Charges payable to such Lender in respect of other Loans or periods shall 
be increased (but not above the Maximum Rate therefor) until such cumulated 
amount, together with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Effective Rate 
to the date of repayment, shall have been received by such Lender.


Section 10.18    Obligations Absolute.     To the fullest extent permitted 
by applicable Requirements of Law, all Obligations of the Borrower 
hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional irrespective of:


(a)    any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, arrangement, 
readjustment, composition, liquidation or the like of any Loan Party;


(b)    any lack of validity or enforceability of any Loan Document or any 
other agreement or instrument relating thereto against any Loan Party;


(c)    any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any 
other term of, all or any of the Obligations, or any other amendment or 
waiver of or any consent to any departure from any Loan Document or any 
other agreement or instrument relating thereto, in each case to the extent 
such change, amendment, waiver, consent or departure is made in accordance 
with Section 10.1;


(d)    any exchange, release or non-perfection of any other Collateral, or 
any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to any departure from any 
guarantee, for all or any of the Obligations;


(e)    any exercise or non-exercise, or any waiver of any right, remedy, 
power or privilege under or in respect hereof or any Loan Document; or


(f)    any other circumstances which might otherwise constitute a defense 
available to, or a discharge of, the Borrower or any of the Loan Parties, 
other than the payment in full of the Obligations.


Section 10.19    Limitation of Liability. The General Partner, as general 
partner of the Borrower, shall not be liable for the obligations of the 
Borrower under this Agreement, including, without limitation, by reason of 
any payment obligation imposed by governing state partnership statutes and 
any provision of the applicable limited partnership agreement of the 
Borrower that requires the General Partner to restore a capital account 
deficit.


Section 10.20    True-Up Loans. Upon the effectiveness of this Agreement, 
(a) each Lender who holds Loans in an aggregate amount less than its 
Applicable Percentage (after giving effect to this amendment and 
restatement) of all Loans shall advance new Loans which shall be disbursed 
to the Administrative Agent and used to repay Loans outstanding to each 
Lender who holds Loans in an aggregate amount greater than its Applicable 
Percentage of all Loans, (b) each Lender’s participation in each Letter of 
Credit shall be automatically adjusted to equal its Applicable Percentage 
(after giving effect to this amendment and restatement), and (c) such other 
adjustments shall be made as the Administrative Agent shall specify so that 
each Lender’s Aggregate Exposure Percentage equals its Applicable 
Percentage (after giving effect to this amendment and restatement) of the 
total Aggregate Exposures of all of the Lenders.




95
------------------------------------------------------------------------


Section 10.21    Acknowledgement and Consent to Bail-In of EEA Financial 
Institutions.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Loan 
Document or in any other agreement, arrangement or understanding among any 
such parties, each party hereto acknowledges that any liability of any EEA 
Financial Institution arising under any Loan Document, to the extent such 
liability is unsecured, may be subject to the Write-Down and Conversion 
Powers of an EEA Resolution Authority and agrees and consents to, and 
acknowledges and agrees to be bound by:


(a)    the application of any Write-Down and Conversion Powers by an EEA 
Resolution Authority to any such liabilities arising hereunder which may be 
payable to it by any party hereto that is an EEA Financial Institution; and


(b)    the effects of any Bail-in Action on any such liability, including, 
if applicable:


(i)    a reduction in full or in part or cancellation of any such 
liability;


(ii)    a conversion of all, or a portion of, such liability into shares or 
other instruments of ownership in such EEA Financial Institution, its 
parent undertaking, or a bridge institution that may be issued to it or 
otherwise conferred on it, and that such shares or other instruments of 
ownership will be accepted by it in lieu of any rights with respect to any 
such liability under this Agreement or any other Loan Document; or


(iii)    the variation of the terms of such liability in connection with 
the exercise of the write-down and conversion powers of any EEA Resolution 
Authority.


The provisions of this Section 10.21 are intended to comply with, and shall 
be interpreted in light of, Article 55 of Directive 2014/59/EU of the 
European Parliament and of the Council of the European Union.


Section 10.22    Exiting Lenders. Subject to receipt of funds necessary to 
pay off all principal, interest, fees and other charges owed under the 
Existing Loan Documents to Lloyds TSB Bank PLC, Suntrust Bank, Société 
Générale, Coöperatieve Rabobank U.A., New York Branch (f/k/a Coöperatieve 
Centrale Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank, B.A., “Rabobank Nederland”, New York 
Branch) and Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. (collectively, the “Exiting Lenders
”, and each individually, an “Exiting Lender”), each of the Exiting Lenders 
hereby (a) consents to the amendment and restatement of the Existing Credit 
Agreement. Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees and confirms that upon 
the effectiveness of this Agreement, each of the Exiting Lender’s 
Commitment shall be $0, its Commitments to lend and all of its obligations 
under the Existing Credit Agreement and this Agreement shall be terminated 
and each of the Exiting Lenders shall cease to be a Lender for all purposes 
under the Loan Documents. The Lenders hereby waive any requirement of the 
Existing Credit Agreement and this Agreement (including Section 2.12 of 
this Agreement) that requires payments to Lenders to be made on a pro rata 
basis solely to the extent necessary to permit the payment to the Exiting 
Lenders of the amounts provided by Section 5.1(p) of this Agreement. The 
Borrower acknowledges and agrees that the provisions of the Existing Credit 
Agreement, including Section 10.5 thereof, by their terms survive the 
termination of the Existing Credit Agreement and the repayment of the loans 
thereunder shall remain in effect and continue to benefit each of the 
Exiting Lenders.


Section 10.23    Amendment and Restatement. It is the intention of the 
Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Exiting Lenders, 
and such parties hereby agree, from and after the Closing Date, this 
Agreement supersedes and replaces the Existing Credit Agreement in its 
entirety, and that (a) such amendment and restatement shall operate to 
renew, amend and modify certain of the rights and obligations of the 
parties under the Existing Credit Agreement as provided herein, but shall 
not act as a novation thereof, and (b) the Liens securing the “Obligations” 
under and as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement shall




96
------------------------------------------------------------------------


not be extinguished, but shall be carried forward and shall secure such 
obligations and Indebtedness as renewed, amended, restated, and modified 
hereby. Unless specifically amended hereby, each of the Loan Documents, the 
Exhibits and the Schedules shall continue in full force and effect and, 
from and after the Closing Date, all references to the “Credit Agreement” 
contained therein shall be deemed to refer to this Agreement. Each Lender 
hereunder that is an Existing Lender and the Borrower each hereby consent 
to the amendments to, and amendments and restatements of, the Existing Loan 
Documents in the form of the Loan Documents.

GUARANTEE


Section 2.1    Guarantee.


     (a)    Each of the Guarantors hereby, jointly and severally,
     unconditionally and irrevocably, guarantees to the Administrative
     Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Secured Parties and their
     respective permitted successors, indorsees, transferees and assigns,
     the prompt and complete payment and performance by the Borrower and
     its Subsidiaries when due (whether at the stated maturity, by
     acceleration or otherwise) of the Obligations.


     (b)    Anything herein or in any other Loan Document to the contrary
     notwithstanding, the maximum liability of each Guarantor hereunder and
     under the other Loan Documents shall in no event exceed the amount
     which can be guaranteed by such Guarantor under applicable federal and
     state laws relating to the insolvency of debtors (after giving effect
     to the right of contribution established in Section 2.2).


     (c)    Each Guarantor agrees that the Obligations may at any time and
     from time to time exceed the amount of the liability of such Guarantor
     hereunder without impairing the guarantee

------------------------------------------------------------------------


     contained in this Article 2 or affecting the rights and remedies of
     the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party hereunder.


     (d)    The guarantee contained in this Article 2 shall remain in full
     force and effect until the Release Date, notwithstanding that from
     time to time during the term of the Credit Agreement the Borrower may
     be free from any Obligations.


     (e)    No payment made by the Borrower, any of the Guarantors, any
     other guarantor or any other Person or received or collected by the
     Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party from the Borrower, any
     of the Guarantors, any other guarantor or any other Person by virtue
     of any action or proceeding or any set-off or appropriation or
     application at any time or from time to time in reduction of or in
     payment of the Obligations shall be deemed to modify, reduce, release
     or otherwise affect the liability of any Guarantor hereunder which
     shall, notwithstanding any such payment (other than any payment made
     by such Guarantor in respect of the Obligations or any payment
     received or collected from such Guarantor in respect of the
     Obligations), remain liable for the Obligations up to the maximum
     liability of such Guarantor hereunder until the Release Date.


     (f)    To the extent that such Guarantor is a Qualified ECP Guarantor,
     each such Guarantor hereby guarantees the payment and performance of
     all Secured Obligations and absolutely, unconditionally and
     irrevocably undertakes to provide such funds or other support as may
     be needed from time to time by such Person in order for such Person to
     honor its obligations (a) under Swap Agreements to which such Person
     is a party and (b) under this Agreement including obligations with
     respect to Swap Agreements (provided, however, that each such
     Guarantor shall only be liable under this Section 2.1(f) for the
     maximum amount of such liability that can be hereby incurred (a)
     without rendering its obligations under this Section 2.1(f), or
     otherwise under this Agreement or any Loan Document, as it relates to
     such other Persons, voidable under applicable law relating to
     fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer, and not for any greater
     amount and (b) without rendering such Guarantor liable for amounts to
     creditors, other than the Secured Parties, that such Guarantor would
     not otherwise have made available to such creditors if this Section
     2.01(f) was not in effect). The obligations of each Guarantor under
     this Section 2.1(f) shall remain in full force and effect until the
     Release Date. The parties intend that this Section 2.1(f) constitute,
     and this Section 2.1(f) shall be deemed to constitute, a “keepwell,
     support, or other agreement” for the benefit of the Borrower and each
     other Guarantor for all purposes of Section 1a(18)(A)(v)(II) of the
     Commodity Exchange Act.


Section 2.2    Right of Contribution. Each Guarantor hereby agrees that to 
the extent that a Guarantor shall have paid more than its proportionate 
share of any payment made hereunder, such Guarantor shall be entitled to 
seek and receive contribution from and against any other Guarantor 
hereunder which has not paid its proportionate share of such payment. Each 
Guarantor’s right of contribution shall be subject to the terms and 
conditions of Section 2.3. The provisions of this Section 2.2 shall in no 
respect limit the obligations and liabilities of any Guarantor to the 
Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties, and each Guarantor 
shall remain liable for the Obligations up to the maximum liability of such 
Guarantor hereunder until the Release Date.


Section 2.3    No Subrogation. Notwithstanding any payment made by any 
Guarantor hereunder or any set-off or application of funds of any Guarantor 
by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party, no Guarantor shall 
be entitled to be subrogated to any of the rights of the Administrative 
Agent or any other Secured Party against the Borrower or any other 
Guarantor or any collateral security or guarantee or right of offset held 
by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party for the payment of 
the Obligations, nor shall any Guarantor seek or be entitled to seek any 
contribution or reimbursement from the Borrower or



7
------------------------------------------------------------------------


any other Guarantor in respect of payments made by such Guarantor 
hereunder, until the Release Date. If any amount shall be paid to any 
Guarantor on account of such subrogation rights at any time when all of the 
Obligations shall not have been paid in full, such amount shall be held by 
such Guarantor in trust for the Administrative Agent and the other Secured 
Parties, segregated from other funds of such Guarantor, and shall, 
forthwith upon receipt by such Guarantor, be turned over to the 
Administrative Agent in the exact form received by such Guarantor (duly 
indorsed by such Guarantor to the Administrative Agent, if required), to be 
applied against the Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in 
accordance with Section 8.2 of the Credit Agreement.


Section 2.4    Amendments, etc. with respect to the Obligations. Each 
Guarantor shall remain obligated hereunder notwithstanding that, without 
any reservation of rights against any Guarantor and without notice to or 
further assent by any Guarantor, any demand for payment of any of the 
Obligations made by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party may 
be rescinded by the Administrative Agent or such other Secured Party and 
any of the Obligations continued, and the Obligations, or the liability of 
any other Person upon or for any part thereof, or any collateral security 
or guarantee therefor or right of offset with respect thereto, may, from 
time to time, in whole or in part, be renewed, extended, amended, modified, 
accelerated, compromised, waived, surrendered or released by the 
Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party, and the Credit Agreement 
and the other Loan Documents and any other documents executed and delivered 
in connection therewith may be amended, modified, supplemented or 
terminated, in whole or in part, as the Administrative Agent (or the 
Required Lenders or all Lenders, as the case may be) and the other parties 
to such documents that are required in connection therewith may deem 
advisable from time to time, and any collateral security, guarantee or 
right of offset at any time held by the Administrative Agent or any other 
Secured Party for the payment of the Obligations may be sold, exchanged, 
waived, surrendered or released in accordance with the Loan Documents and 
any other documents executed and delivered in connection therewith. Neither 
the Administrative Agent nor any other Secured Party shall have any 
obligation to protect, secure, perfect or insure any Lien at any time held 
by it as security for the Obligations or for the guarantee contained in 
this Article 2 or any property subject thereto.


Section 2.5    Guarantee Absolute and Unconditional. Each Guarantor waives 
any and all notice of the creation, renewal, extension or accrual of any of 
the Obligations and notice of or proof of reliance by the Administrative 
Agent or any other Secured Party upon the guarantee contained in this 
Article 2 or acceptance of the guarantee contained in this Article 2; the 
Obligations, and any of them, shall conclusively be deemed to have been 
created, contracted or incurred, or renewed, extended, amended or waived, 
in reliance upon the guarantee contained in this Article 2; and all 
dealings between the Borrower and any of the Guarantors, on the one hand, 
and the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties, on the other 
hand, likewise shall be conclusively presumed to have been had or 
consummated in reliance upon the guarantee contained in this Article 2. 
Each Guarantor waives diligence, presentment, protest, demand for payment 
and notice of default or nonpayment to or upon the Borrower or any of the 
Guarantors with respect to the Obligations. To the maximum extent permitted 
by any Requirement of Law, each Guarantor understands and agrees that the 
guarantee contained in this Article 2 shall be construed as a continuing, 
absolute and unconditional guarantee of payment and not of collection 
without regard to (a) the validity or enforceability of the Credit 
Agreement or any other Loan Document, any of the Obligations or any other 
collateral security therefor or guarantee or right of offset with respect 
thereto at any time or from time to time held by the Administrative Agent 
or any other Secured Party, (b) any defense, set-off or counterclaim (other 
than a defense of payment or performance) which may at any time be 
available to or be asserted by the Borrower or any other Person against the 
Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party, or (c) any other 
circumstance whatsoever (with or without notice to or knowledge of the 
Borrower or such Guarantor) which constitutes, or might be construed to 
constitute, an equitable or legal discharge of the Borrower for the 
Obligations, or of such Guarantor under the guarantee contained in this 
Article 2, in bankruptcy or in any other instance



8
------------------------------------------------------------------------


(other than a defense of payment or performance). When making any demand 
hereunder or otherwise pursuing its rights and remedies hereunder against 
any Guarantor, the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party may, but 
shall be under no obligation to, make a similar demand on or otherwise 
pursue such rights and remedies as it may have against the Borrower, any 
other Guarantor or any other Person or against any collateral security or 
guarantee for the Obligations or any right of offset with respect thereto, 
and any failure by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party to 
make any such demand, to pursue such other rights or remedies or to collect 
any payments from the Borrower, any other Guarantor or any other Person or 
to realize upon any such collateral security or guarantee or to exercise 
any such right of offset, or any release of the Borrower, any other 
Guarantor or any other Person or any such collateral security, guarantee or 
right of offset, shall not relieve any Guarantor of any obligation or 
liability hereunder, and shall not impair or affect the rights and 
remedies, whether express, implied or available as a matter of law, of the 
Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party against any Guarantor. For 
the purposes hereof “demand” shall include the commencement and continuance 
of any legal proceedings.


Section 2.6    Payments. Each Guarantor hereby guarantees that payments 
hereunder will be paid to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the 
Secured Parties, without set-off or counterclaim in Dollars at the Funding 
Office.


ARTICLE 3.

Each Grantor hereby grants to the Administrative Agent, for the ratable 
benefit of the Secured Parties, a security interest in all of the following 
property now owned or at any time hereafter acquired by such Grantor or in 
which such Grantor now has or at any time in the future may acquire any 
right, title or interest (collectively, the “Collateral”), as collateral 
security for the prompt and complete payment and performance when due 
(whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) of the 
Secured Obligations:


     (a)    all Accounts;


     (b)    all Chattel Paper;


     (c)    all Deposit Accounts;


     (d)    all Documents;


     (e)    all Equipment;


     (f)    all Fixtures;


     (g)    all General Intangibles;

     (i)    all Intellectual Property;


     (j)    all Inventory;


     (k)    all Investment Property;


     (l)    all Commercial Tort Claims;



9
------------------------------------------------------------------------


     (m)    all other property not otherwise described above (except for
     any property specifically excluded from any clause in this Section
     above, and any property specifically excluded from any defined term
     used in any clause of this Section above);


     (n)    all books and records pertaining to the Collateral; and


     (o)    to the extent not otherwise included, all Proceeds, Supporting
     Obligations and products of any and all of the foregoing and all

     any of the foregoing;


provided, however, that notwithstanding any other provision set forth in 
this Article 3 or elsewhere in this Agreement, this Agreement shall not, at 
any time, constitute a grant of a security interest in any property that 
is, at such time, Excluded Property, and the term “Collateral” and each of 
the defined terms incorporated therein shall exclude all Excluded Property.

ARTICLE 4.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

To induce the Administrative Agent and the Lenders to enter into the Credit 
Agreement and to induce the Lenders to make their respective extensions of 
credit to the Borrower thereunder, each Grantor hereby represents and 
warrants to the Administrative Agent and each Lender that:

Section 4.1    Title; No Other Liens. Except for the security interest 
granted to the Administrative Agent for the ratable benefit of the Secured 
Parties pursuant to this Agreement and the other Liens permitted to exist 
on the Collateral by the Credit Agreement, such Grantor owns or has a valid 
leasehold interest in each item of the Collateral free and clear of any and 
all Liens or claims of others. No financing statement or other public 
notice with respect to all or any part of the Collateral is on file or of 
record in any public office, except such as have been filed in favor of the 
Administrative Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Secured Parties, 
pursuant to this Agreement or as are permitted by the Credit Agreement. For 
the avoidance of doubt, it is understood and agreed that any Grantor may, 
as part of its business, grant licenses to third parties to use 
Intellectual Property owned or developed by a Grantor. For purposes of this 
Agreement and the other Loan Documents, such licensing activity shall not 
constitute a “Lien” on such Intellectual Property. Each of the 
Administrative Agent and each other Secured Party understands that any such 
licenses may be exclusive to the applicable licensees, and such exclusivity 
provisions may limit the ability of the Administrative Agent to utilize, 
sell, lease or transfer the related Intellectual Property or otherwise 
realize value from such Intellectual Property pursuant hereto.


Section 4.2    Perfected First Priority Liens. The security interests 
granted pursuant to this Agreement (a) upon completion of the filings and 
other actions specified on Schedule 3 will constitute valid perfected 
security interests in all of the Collateral in favor of the Administrative 
Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Secured Parties, as collateral 
security for such Grantor’s Secured Obligations, enforceable in accordance 
with the terms hereof and (b) are prior to all other Liens on the 
Collateral in existence on the date hereof except for Liens permitted by 
the Credit Agreement which have priority over the Liens on the Collateral 
by operation of law.


Section 4.3    Jurisdiction of Organization; Chief Executive Office. On the 
date hereof, such Grantor’s jurisdiction of organization, identification 
number from the jurisdiction of organization (if any), and the location of 
such Grantor’s chief executive office or sole place of business or 
principal residence, as the case may be, are specified on Schedule 4. Such 
Grantor has furnished to the Administrative Agent a certified charter, 
certificate of incorporation or other organization document and good 
standing certificate as of a date which is recent to the date hereof.



10
------------------------------------------------------------------------


Section 4.4    Inventory and Equipment. On the date hereof, substantially 
all of the Inventory and the Equipment (other than mobile goods, pipelines, 
Equipment and Inventory in transit and pumping stations) are kept at the 
locations listed on Schedule 5.


Section 4.5    Investment Property.


     (a)    The shares of Pledged Stock pledged by such Grantor hereunder
     constitute all the issued and outstanding shares of all classes of the
     Capital Stock of each Issuer owned by such Grantor or, in the case of
     Foreign Subsidiary Voting Stock, the lesser of 65% and all of the
     outstanding Foreign Subsidiary Voting Stock of each relevant Issuer
     owned by such Grantor.


     (b)    All the shares of the Pledged Stock issued by any Issuer that
     is a Subsidiary of the Borrower have been duly and validly issued and
     are fully paid and nonassessable (or, with respect to the Pledged
     Stock that is Capital Stock in a partnership or limited liability
     company, has been duly and validly issued).


     (c)    With respect to the Pledged Stock of any Issuer that is a
     Subsidiary of the Borrower, there are no restrictions on transfer
     (that have not been waived or otherwise consented to) in the LLC
     Agreement governing any Pledged LLC Interest or the Partnership
     Agreement governing any Pledged Partnership Interest or any other
     agreement relating thereto which would limit or restrict: (i) the
     grant of a security interest in the Pledged LLC Interests or the
     Pledged Partnership Interests, (ii) the perfection of such security
     interest or (iii) the exercise of remedies in respect of such
     perfected security interest in the Pledged LLC Interests or the
     Pledged Partnership Interests, in each case, as contemplated by this
     Agreement. With respect to the Pledged Stock of any Issuer that is a
     Subsidiary of the Borrower, upon the exercise of remedies in respect
     of the Pledged LLC Interests or the Pledged Partnership Interests, a
     transferee or assignee of a membership interest or a partnership
     interest, as the case may be, of such LLC or Partnership, as the case
     may be, shall become a member or partner, as the case may be, of such
     LLC or Partnership, as the case may be, entitled to participate in the
     management thereof and, upon the transfer of the entire interest of
     such Grantor, such Grantor shall cease to be a member or partner, as
     the case may be.


     (d)    Each of the Pledged Notes constitutes the legal, valid and
     binding obligation of the obligor with respect thereto, enforceable in
     accordance with its terms, subject to the effects of bankruptcy,
     insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and
     other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors’ rights
     generally, general equitable principles (whether considered in a
     proceeding in equity or at law) and an implied covenant of good faith
     and fair dealing.


     (e)    Such Grantor is the record and beneficial owner of, and has
     good title to, the Investment Property pledged by it hereunder, free
     of any and all Liens or options in favor of, or claims of, any other
     Person, except the security interest created by this Agreement.


     (f)    No Grantor is party to any Partnership Agreement or LLC
     Agreement that includes an election to treat the membership interests
     or partnership interests of such Grantor as a security under Section
     8-103 of the New York UCC.


Section 4.6    Receivables. The amounts represented by such Grantor to the 
Secured Parties from time to time as owing to such Grantor in respect of 
the Receivables will at such times be accurate (subject to offsets and 
refunds in the ordinary course of business).


Section 4.7    Intellectual Property.



11
------------------------------------------------------------------------


     (a)    Schedule 6 lists all registered Intellectual Property owned by
     such Grantor in its own name on the date hereof. The Grantor solely
     owns all such registered Intellectual Property and any material
     Intellectual Property used in the conduct of the business except for
     Intellectual Property licensed to Grantor pursuant to licenses set
     forth on Schedule 6. No current or former partner, director, officer,
     or employee of Grantor will, after giving effect to each of the
     transactions contemplated by this Agreement, own or retain any rights
     in or to, or have the right to receive any royalty or other payment
     with respect to, any of the Intellectual Property used or owned by
     Grantor.


     (b)    On the date hereof, all material Intellectual Property is
     valid, subsisting, unexpired and enforceable, has not been abandoned
     and the use of the Intellectual Property does not infringe in any
     material respects on the intellectual property rights of any other
     Person.


     (c)    Except as set forth in Schedule 6, on the date hereof, none of
     the material Intellectual Property is the subject of any licensing or
     franchise agreement pursuant to which such Grantor is the licensor or
     franchisor.


     (d)    No holding, decision or judgment has been rendered by any
     Governmental Authority which would limit, cancel or question the
     validity of, or such Grantor’s rights in, any Intellectual Property in
     any respect that could reasonably be expected to have a Material
     Adverse Effect.


     (e)    No action or proceeding is pending, or, to the knowledge of
     such Grantor, threatened, on the date hereof (i) seeking to limit,
     cancel or question the validity of any material Intellectual Property
     or such Grantor’s ownership interest therein, or (ii) which, if
     adversely determined, would have a material adverse effect on the
     value of any Intellectual Property.


Section 4.8    Commercial Tort Claims.


     (a)    On the date hereof, except to the extent listed in Section 3(l)
      above, no Grantor is aware that it has rights in any Commercial Tort
     Claim with potential value in excess of $500,000.


     (b)    Upon the filing of a financing statement covering any
     Commercial Tort Claim referred to in Section 5.9 against such Grantor
     in the jurisdiction specified in Schedule 3 hereto, the security
     interest granted in such Commercial Tort Claim will constitute a valid
     perfected security interest in favor of the Administrative Agent, for
     the ratable benefit of the Secured Parties, as collateral security for
     the Secured Obligations, enforceable in accordance with the terms
     hereof against all creditors of such Grantor and any Persons
     purporting to purchase such Collateral from Grantor, which security
     interest shall be prior to all other Liens on such Collateral except
     for unrecorded liens permitted by the Credit Agreement which have
     priority over the Liens on such Collateral by operation of law.


Section 4.9    Deposit Accounts. Schedule 7 lists all Deposit Accounts 
owned by such Grantor in its own name on the date hereof.


Section 4.10    Transmitting Utilities. Except as disclosed to the 
Administrative Agent by the Borrower in writing after the Closing Date, 
such Grantor, other than BKEP Crude, L.L.C. and BKEP Pipeline, L.L.C., is 
not a Transmitting Utility.


Section 4.11    Representations in the Credit Agreement. In the case of 
each Grantor other than the Borrower, the representations and warranties 
set forth in Article 4 of the Credit Agreement as they relate to such 
Grantor or to the Loan Documents to which such Grantor is a party, each of 
which is hereby incorporated by reference, are true and correct in all 
material respects, and the Administrative Agent and the



12
------------------------------------------------------------------------


Lenders shall be entitled to rely on each of them; provided that each 
reference in each such representation and warranty to the Borrower’s 
knowledge shall, for the purposes of this Section 4.11, be deemed to be a 
reference to such Grantor’s knowledge.


ARTICLE 5.
COVENANTS


Each Grantor covenants and agrees with the Administrative Agent and the 
Lenders that, from and after the date of this Agreement until the Release 
Date:

Paper. If any amount payable under or in connection with any of the 
Collateral shall be or become evidenced by any Instrument, Certificated 
Security or Chattel Paper, such Instrument, Certificated Security or 
Chattel Paper shall be immediately delivered to the Administrative Agent, 
duly indorsed in a manner satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, to be 
held as Collateral pursuant to this Agreement; provided that no such

     limitation, (i) filing any financing or continuation statements under
     the Uniform Commercial Code (or other similar laws) in effect in any
     jurisdiction with respect to the security interests created hereby and
     (ii) in the case of Investment Property, Deposit Accounts,

     “control” (within the meaning of the applicable Uniform Commercial
     Code) with respect thereto.


Section 5.4    Changes in Name, etc. Such Grantor will not, except upon 15 
days’ (or such shorter period of time permitted by the Administrative Agent 
in its sole discretion) prior written notice to the Administrative Agent 
and delivery to the Administrative Agent of all additional financing 
statements and other documents reasonably requested by the Administrative 
Agent to maintain the validity, perfection and priority of the security 
interests provided for herein, (i) change its jurisdiction of organization

a “registered organization” (within the meaning of Section 9-102(a)70) of 
the New York UCC, the location of its chief executive office or sole place 
of business or principal residence from that referred to in Section 4.3 or 
(ii) change its name.


Section 5.5    Notices. Such Grantor will advise the Administrative Agent 
promptly, in reasonable detail, of:


     (a)    any Lien (other than security interests created hereby or Liens
     permitted under the Credit Agreement) on any of the Collateral which
     would adversely affect the ability of the Administrative Agent to
     exercise any of its remedies hereunder; and


     (b)    the occurrence of any other event which could reasonably be
     expected to have a material adverse effect on the aggregate value of
     the Collateral or on the security interests created hereby.


Section 5.6    Investment Property.


     (a)    If such Grantor shall become entitled to receive or shall
     receive any certificate (including, without limitation, any
     certificate representing a dividend or a distribution in connection
     with any reclassification, increase or reduction of capital or any
     certificate issued in connection with any reorganization), option or
     rights in respect of the Capital Stock of any Issuer, whether in
     addition to, in substitution of, as a conversion of, or in exchange
     for, any shares of the Pledged Stock, or otherwise in respect thereof,
     such Grantor shall accept the same as the agent of the Administrative
     Agent and the other Secured Parties, hold the same in trust for the
     Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties and deliver the
     same forthwith to the Administrative Agent in the exact form received,
     duly indorsed by such Grantor to the Administrative Agent, if
     required, together with an undated stock power covering such
     certificate duly executed in blank by such Grantor and with, if the
     Administrative Agent so requests, signature guaranteed, to be held by
     the Administrative Agent, subject to the terms hereof, as additional
     collateral security for the Secured Obligations. Any sums paid upon or
     in respect of the Investment Property upon the liquidation or
     dissolution of any Issuer shall, if an Event of Default then exists,
     be paid over to the Administrative Agent to be held by it hereunder as
     additional collateral security for the Secured Obligations, and in
     case any distribution of capital shall be made on or in respect of the
     Investment Property or any property shall be distributed upon or with
     respect to the Investment Property pursuant to the recapitalization or
     reclassification of the capital of any Issuer or pursuant to the
     reorganization thereof, the property so distributed shall, unless
     otherwise subject to a perfected security interest in favor of the
     Administrative Agent, be delivered to the Administrative Agent to be
     held by it hereunder as additional collateral security for the Secured
     Obligations. If any sums of money or property so paid or distributed
     in respect of the Investment Property shall be received by such
     Grantor during the continuance of an Event of Default, such Grantor
     shall, until such money or property is paid or delivered to the
     Administrative Agent, hold such money or property in trust for the
     Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties, segregated from
     other funds of such Grantor, as additional collateral security for the
     Secured Obligations. Each Grantor hereby authorizes and instructs each
     Issuer of any Investment Property pledged by such Grantor hereunder to
     notify the Administrative Agent promptly in writing of the occurrence
     of any of the events described in this Section 5.6(a).


     (b)    Without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent,
     such Grantor will not (i) vote to enable, or take any other action to
     permit, any Subsidiary of the Borrower that is an Issuer to issue any
     Capital Stock of any nature or to issue any other securities
     convertible into or



14
------------------------------------------------------------------------


     granting the right to purchase or exchange for any Capital Stock of
     any nature of any Issuer (unless such Capital Stock shall otherwise be
     subject to a perfected security interest in favor of the
     Administrative Agent), (ii) sell, assign, transfer, exchange, or
     otherwise dispose of, or grant any option with respect to, the
     Investment Property or Proceeds thereof (except pursuant to a
     transaction expressly permitted by the Credit Agreement), (iii)
     create, incur or permit to exist any Lien or option in favor of, or
     any claim of any Person with respect to, any of the Investment
     Property or Proceeds thereof, or any interest therein, except for the
     security interests created by this Agreement or (iv) enter into any
     agreement or undertaking restricting the right or ability of such
     Grantor or the Administrative Agent to sell, assign or transfer any of
     the Investment Property or Proceeds thereof (except pursuant to a
     transaction expressly permitted by the Credit Agreement).


     (c)    In the case of each Grantor which is an Issuer, such Issuer
     agrees that (i) it will be bound by the terms of this Agreement
     relating to the Investment Property issued by it and will comply with
     such terms insofar as such terms are applicable to it, (ii) it will
     notify the Administrative Agent promptly in writing of the occurrence
     of any of the events described in Section 5.6(a) with respect to the
     Investment Property issued by it and (iii) the terms of Section 6.3(c)
      and Section 6.7 shall apply to it, mutatis mutandis, with respect to
     all actions that may be required of it pursuant to Section 6.3(c) or 
     Section 6.7 with respect to the Investment Property issued by it. In
     the case of any Issuer that is not a Grantor hereunder or a Wholly
     Owned Subsidiary of the Borrower, such Grantor will use commercially
     reasonable efforts to cause such Issuer to execute and deliver to the
     Administrative Agent an Acknowledgment and Consent.


     (d)    In the case of each Grantor that is a partner in a Partnership,
     such Grantor hereby consents to the extent required by the applicable
     Partnership Agreement to the pledge by each other Grantor, pursuant to
     the terms hereof, of the Pledged Partnership Interests in such
     Partnership and to the transfer of such Pledged Partnership Interests
     to the Administrative Agent or its nominee following the occurrence
     and during the continuance of an Event of Default and thereafter to
     the substitution of the Administrative Agent or its nominee as a
     substituted partner in such Partnership with all the rights, powers
     and duties of a general partner or a limited partner, as the case may
     be. In the case of each Grantor that is a member of an LLC, such
     Grantor hereby consents to the extent required by the applicable LLC
     Agreement to the pledge by each other Grantor, pursuant to the terms
     hereof, of the Pledged LLC Interests in such LLC and to the transfer
     of such Pledged LLC Interests to the Administrative Agent or its
     nominee following the occurrence and during the continuance of an
     Event of Default and thereafter to the substitution of the
     Administrative Agent or its nominee as a substituted member of the LLC
     with all the rights, powers and duties of a member of such LLC.


     (e)    Such Grantor shall not agree to any amendment of a Partnership
     Agreement or an LLC Agreement that (i) in any way adversely affects
     the perfection of the security interest of the Administrative Agent in
     the Pledged Partnership Interests or Pledged LLC Interests pledged by
     such Grantor hereunder or (ii) causes any Partnership Agreement or LLC
     Agreement to include an election to treat the membership interests or
     partnership interests of such Grantor as a security under Section
     8-103 of the New York UCC.


Section 5.7    Receivables.


     (a)    Other than in the ordinary course of business consistent with
     its past practice, such Grantor will not (i) grant any extension of
     the time of payment of any Receivable, (ii) compromise or settle any
     Receivable for less than the full amount thereof, (iii) release,
     wholly or partially, any Person liable for the payment of any
     Receivable, (iv) allow any credit or discount whatsoever on any
     Receivable



15
------------------------------------------------------------------------


     or (v) amend, supplement or modify any Receivable in any manner that
     could adversely affect the value thereof.


     (b)    Such Grantor will deliver to the Administrative Agent a copy of
     each material demand, notice or document received by it that questions
     or calls into doubt the validity or enforceability of more than 5% of
     the aggregate amount of the then outstanding Receivables.


Section 5.8    Intellectual Property.


     (a)    Such Grantor (either itself or through licensees) will, in the
     exercise of its reasonable business judgment, taking into account the
     Administrative Agent’s interests under this Agreement, (i) continue to
     use each material Trademark on each and every trademark class of goods
     applicable to its current line as reflected in its current catalogs,
     brochures and price lists in order to maintain such Trademark in full
     force free from any claim of abandonment for non-use, (ii) maintain as
     in the past the quality of products and services offered under such
     Trademark, (iii) use such Trademark with the appropriate notice of
     registration and all other notices and legends required by applicable
     Requirements of Law, (iv) not adopt or use any mark which is
     confusingly similar or a colorable imitation of such Trademark unless
     the Administrative Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Secured
     Parties, shall obtain a perfected security interest in such mark
     pursuant to this Agreement, and (v) not (and not permit any licensee
     or sublicensee thereof to) do any act or knowingly omit to do any act
     whereby such Trademark may become invalidated or impaired in any way.


     (b)    Such Grantor (either itself or through licensees), subject to
     the exercise of its reasonable business judgment, taking into account
     the Administrative Agent’s interests under this Agreement, will not do
     any act, or omit to do any act, whereby any material Patent may become
     forfeited, abandoned or dedicated to the public.


     (c)    Such Grantor (either itself or through licensees), subject to
     the exercise of its reasonable business judgment, taking into account
     the Administrative Agent’s interests under this Agreement, (i) will
     employ each material Copyright and (ii) will not (and will not permit
     any licensee or sublicensee thereof to) do any act or knowingly omit
     to do any act whereby any material portion of such Copyrights may
     become invalidated or otherwise impaired. Such Grantor will not
     (either itself or through licensees) do any act whereby any material
     portion of the Copyrights that constitute material Intellectual
     Property may fall into the public domain.


     (d)    Such Grantor (either itself or through licensees) will not do
     any act that knowingly uses any material Intellectual Property to
     infringe the intellectual property rights of any other Person.


     (e)    Such Grantor will notify the Administrative Agent and the
     Lenders immediately if it knows, or has reason to know, that any
     application or registration relating to any material Intellectual
     Property may become forfeited, abandoned or dedicated to the public,
     or of any adverse determination or development (including, without
     limitation, the institution of, or any such determination or
     development in, any proceeding in the United States Patent and
     Trademark Office, the United States Copyright Office or any court or
     tribunal in any country) regarding such Grantor’s ownership of, or the
     validity of, any material Intellectual Property or such Grantor’s
     right to register the same or to own and maintain the same.


     (f)    Whenever such Grantor, either by itself or through any agent,
     employee, licensee or designee, shall file an application for the
     registration or issuance of any Intellectual Property with the United
     States Patent and Trademark Office, the United States Copyright Office
     or any similar



16
------------------------------------------------------------------------


     office or agency in any other country or any political subdivision
     thereof, or purchase or acquire any registered Intellectual Property
     or application therefor, from a third party, such Grantor shall report
     such filing or acquisition to the Administrative Agent within 45 days
     (or 90 days for the last fiscal quarter in each year) after the last
     day of the fiscal quarter in which such filing occurs. Upon request of
     the Administrative Agent, such Grantor shall execute and deliver, and
     have recorded, any and all agreements, instruments, documents, and
     papers as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request to evidence
     the Administrative Agent’s security interest in any Copyright, Patent
     or Trademark and the goodwill and general intangibles of such Grantor
     relating thereto or represented thereby.


     (g)    Such Grantor will, subject to the exercise of its reasonable
     business judgment, taking into account the Administrative Agent’s
     interests under this Agreement, take all reasonable and necessary
     steps, including, without limitation, in any proceeding before the
     United States Patent and Trademark Office, the United States Copyright
     Office or any similar office or agency in any other country or any
     political subdivision thereof, to maintain and pursue each application
     (and to obtain the relevant registration) and to maintain each
     registration of the material Intellectual Property, including, without
     limitation, filing of applications for renewal, affidavits of use and
     affidavits of incontestability.


     (h)    In the event that any material Intellectual Property is
     infringed, misappropriated or diluted by a third party, such Grantor
     shall (i) take such actions as such Grantor shall reasonably deem
     appropriate under the circumstances to protect such Intellectual
     Property and (ii) if such Intellectual Property is of material
     economic value, promptly notify the Administrative Agent after it
     learns thereof and sue for infringement, misappropriation or dilution,
     to seek injunctive relief where appropriate and to recover any and all
     damages for such infringement, misappropriation or dilution.


Section 5.9    Commercial Tort Claims. If such Grantor shall obtain an 
interest in any Commercial Tort Claim with a potential value in excess of 
$500,000, such Grantor shall within thirty (30) days of a Responsible 
Officer obtaining knowledge of such interest sign and deliver documentation 
acceptable to the Administrative Agent granting a security interest under 
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in and to such Commercial Tort 
Claim.


Section 5.10    Transmitting Utilities. Unless previously disclosed to the 
Administrative Agent in writing, each Grantor, other than BKEP Crude, 
L.L.C. and BKEP Pipeline, L.L.C., shall promptly notify the Administrative 
Agent in writing if it engages in any activity that would or might cause it 
to be a Transmitting Utility.


Section 5.11    Covenants in Credit Agreement. Such Grantor shall take, or 
shall refrain from taking, as the case may be, each action that is 
necessary to be taken or not taken, as the case may be, by it so that no 
Default or Event of Default is caused by the failure to take such action or 
to refrain from taking such action by such Grantor.

     (a)    The Administrative Agent shall have the right to make test
     verifications of the Receivables in any manner and through any medium
     that it reasonably considers advisable, and each Grantor shall furnish
     all such assistance and information as the Administrative Agent may
     reasonably require in connection with such test verifications.



17
------------------------------------------------------------------------


     (b)    Each Grantor hereby agrees to use its commercially reasonable
     efforts to continue to collect all amounts due or to become due to
     such Grantor under the Receivables and any Supporting Obligation and
     diligently exercise each material right it may have under any
     Receivable and any Supporting Obligation, in each case, at its own
     expense. If required by the Administrative Agent at any time after the
     occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, any
     payments of Receivables, when collected by any Grantor, (i) shall be
     forthwith (and, in any event, within two Business Days) deposited by
     such Grantor in the exact form received, duly indorsed by such Grantor
     to the Administrative Agent if required, in a Collateral Account
     maintained under the sole dominion and control of the Administrative
     Agent, subject to withdrawal by the Administrative Agent for the
     account of the Secured Parties only as provided in Section 6.5, and
     (ii) until so turned over, shall be held by such Grantor in trust for
     the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties, segregated
     from other funds of such Grantor. Each such deposit of Proceeds of
     Receivables shall be accompanied by a report identifying in reasonable
     detail the nature and source of the payments included in the deposit.


     (c)    At the Administrative Agent’s request, each Grantor shall
     deliver to the Administrative Agent all original and other documents
     evidencing, and relating to, the agreements and transactions which
     gave rise to the Receivables, including, without limitation, all
     original orders, invoices and shipping receipts.


Section 6.2    Communications with Obligors; Grantors Remain Liable.


     (a)    The Administrative Agent in its own name or in the name of
     others may at any time after the occurrence and during the continuance
     of an Event of Default communicate with obligors under the Receivables
     to verify with them to the Administrative Agent’s satisfaction the
     existence, amount and terms of any Receivables.


     (b)    The Administrative Agent may at any time after the occurrence
     and during the continuance of an Event of Default notify, or require
     any Grantor to so notify (whereupon such Grantor shall so notify) the
     obligors on the Receivables of the security interest of the
     Administrative Agent therein. In addition, after the occurrence and
     during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Administrative
     Agent may upon written notice to the applicable Grantor, notify, or
     require any Grantor to notify (whereupon such Grantor shall so notify)
     the obligors on the Receivables to make all payments under such
     Receivables directly to the Administrative Agent.


     (c)    Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, each Grantor
     shall remain liable under each of the Receivables to observe and
     perform all the conditions and obligations to be observed and
     performed by it thereunder, all in accordance with the terms of any
     agreement giving rise thereto. Neither the Administrative Agent nor
     any other Secured Party shall have any obligation or liability under
     any Receivable (or any agreement giving rise thereto) by reason of or
     arising out of this Agreement or the receipt by the Administrative
     Agent or any other Secured Party of any payment relating thereto, nor
     shall the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party be obligated
     in any manner to perform any of the obligations of any Grantor under
     or pursuant to any Receivable (or any agreement giving rise thereto),
     to make any payment, to make any inquiry as to the nature or the
     sufficiency of any payment received by it or as to the sufficiency of
     any performance by any party thereunder, to present or file any claim,
     to take any action to enforce any performance or to collect the
     payment of any amounts which may have been assigned to it or to which
     it may be entitled at any time or times.

Section 6.3    Pledged Stock.


     (a)    Unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and be
     continuing and the Administrative Agent shall have given notice to the
     relevant Grantor of the Administrative Agent’s intent to exercise its
     corresponding rights pursuant to Section 6.3(b), each Grantor shall be
     permitted to receive all cash dividends, payments or other Proceeds,
     in each case, paid in respect of the Pledged Stock and all payments
     made in respect of the Pledged Notes to the extent permitted in the
     Credit Agreement, and to exercise all voting and corporate or other
     organizational rights with respect to the Investment Property; 
     provided, however, that no vote shall be cast or corporate or other
     organizational right exercised or other action taken which would
     result in a Default.


     (b)    If an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing and the
     Administrative Agent shall give notice of its intent to exercise such
     rights to the relevant Grantor or Grantors, (i) the Administrative
     Agent shall have the right to receive any and all cash dividends,
     payments or other Proceeds paid in respect of the Investment Property
     and make application thereof to the Secured Obligations in accordance
     with Section 6.5, and (ii) any or all of the Investment Property shall
     be registered in the name of the Administrative Agent or its nominee,
     and the Administrative Agent or its nominee may thereafter exercise
     (x) all voting, corporate and other rights pertaining to such
     Investment Property at any meeting of shareholders of the relevant
     Issuer or Issuers or otherwise and (y) any and all rights of
     conversion, exchange and subscription and any other rights, privileges
     or options pertaining to such Investment Property as if it were the
     absolute owner thereof (including, without limitation, the right to
     exchange at its discretion any and all of the Investment Property upon
     the merger, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization or other
     fundamental change in the corporate or other organizational structure
     of any Issuer, or upon the exercise by any Grantor or the
     Administrative Agent of any right, privilege or option pertaining to
     such Investment Property, and in connection therewith, the right to
     deposit and deliver any and all of the Investment Property with any
     committee, depositary, transfer agent, registrar or other designated
     agency upon such terms and conditions as the Administrative Agent may
     determine), all without liability except to account for property
     actually received by it, but the Administrative Agent shall have no
     duty to any Grantor to exercise any such right, privilege or option
     and shall not be responsible for any failure to do so or delay in so
     doing.


     (c)    Each Grantor hereby authorizes and instructs each Issuer of any
     Investment Property pledged by such Grantor hereunder to (i) comply
     with any instruction received by it from the Administrative Agent in
     writing that (x) states that an Event of Default has occurred and is
     continuing and (y) is otherwise in accordance with the terms of this
     Agreement, without any other or further instructions from such
     Grantor, and each Grantor agrees that each Issuer shall be fully
     protected in so complying, and (ii) upon any such instruction by the
     Administrative Agent following the occurrence and during the
     continuance of an Event of Default, pay any dividends or other
     payments with respect to the Investment Property directly to the
     Administrative Agent.


Section 6.4    Proceeds to be Turned Over To Administrative Agent. In 
addition to the rights of the Administrative Agent specified in Section 6.1
 with respect to payments of Receivables, if an Event of Default shall 
occur and be continuing, all Proceeds received by any Grantor consisting of 
cash, checks and other near-cash items shall, if requested in writing by 
the Administrative Agent, be held by such Grantor in trust for the 
Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties, segregated from other 
funds of such Grantor, and shall, forthwith upon receipt by such Grantor, 
be turned over to the Administrative Agent in the exact form received by 
such Grantor (duly indorsed by such Grantor to the Administrative Agent, if 
required). All Proceeds received by the Administrative Agent hereunder 
shall be held by the Administrative Agent in a Collateral Account 
maintained under its sole dominion and control. All Proceeds while held by 
the



19
------------------------------------------------------------------------


Administrative Agent in a Collateral Account (or by such Grantor in trust 
for the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties) shall continue 
to be held as collateral security for all the Secured Obligations and shall 
not constitute payment thereof until applied as provided in Section 6.5.


Section 6.5    Application of Proceeds. At such intervals as may be agreed 
upon by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, or, if an Event of 
Default shall have occurred and be continuing, at any time at the 
Administrative Agent's election, the Administrative Agent may apply all or 
any part of Proceeds constituting Collateral realized through the exercise 
by the Administrative Agent of its rights hereunder, whether or not held in 
any Collateral Account, and any proceeds of the guarantee set forth in 
Article 2, in payment of the Secured Obligations in accordance with Section 
8.2 of the Credit Agreement.


Section 6.6    Code and Other Remedies. If an Event of Default shall occur 
and be continuing, the Administrative Agent, on behalf of the Secured 
Parties, may exercise, in addition to all other rights and remedies granted 
to it in this Agreement and in any other instrument or agreement securing, 
evidencing or relating to the Secured Obligations, all rights and remedies 
of a secured party under the New York UCC or any other applicable law. 
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if an Event of Default 
has occurred and is continuing, the Administrative Agent, without demand of 
performance or other demand, presentment, protest, advertisement or notice 
of any kind (except any notice required by law referred to below) to or 
upon any Grantor or any other Person (all and each of which demands, 
defenses, advertisements and notices are hereby waived), may in such 
circumstances forthwith collect, receive, appropriate and realize upon the 
Collateral, or any part thereof, and/or may forthwith sell, lease, assign, 
give option or options to purchase, or otherwise dispose of and deliver the 
Collateral or any part thereof (or contract to do any of the foregoing), in 
one or more parcels at public or private sale or sales, at any exchange, 
broker’s board or office of the Administrative Agent or any other Secured 
Party or elsewhere upon such terms and conditions as it may deem advisable 
and at such prices as it may deem best, for cash or on credit or for future 
delivery without assumption of any credit risk. The Administrative Agent or 
any other Secured Party shall have the right upon any such public sale or 
sales, and, to the extent permitted by law, upon any such private sale or 
sales, to purchase the whole or any part of the Collateral so sold, free of 
any right or equity of redemption in any Grantor, which right or equity is 
hereby waived and released. Each Grantor further agrees, at the 
Administrative Agent’s request, to assemble the Collateral and make it 
available to the Administrative Agent at places which the Administrative 
Agent shall reasonably select, whether at such Grantor’s premises or 
elsewhere. The Administrative Agent shall apply the net proceeds of any 
action taken by it pursuant to this Section 6.6, after deducting all 
reasonable costs and expenses of every kind incurred in connection 
therewith or incidental to the care or safekeeping of any of the Collateral 
or in any way relating to the Collateral or the rights of the 
Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties hereunder, including, 
without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and disbursements, to the 
payment in whole or in part of the Secured Obligations, in such order as 
provided in Section 6.5, and only after such application and after the 
payment by the Administrative Agent of any other amount required by any 
provision of law, including, without limitation, Section 9-615(a)(3) of the 
New York UCC, need the Administrative Agent account for the surplus, if 
any, to any Grantor. To the extent permitted by applicable law, each 
Grantor waives all claims, damages and demands it may acquire against the 
Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party arising out of the exercise 
by them of any rights hereunder. If any notice of a proposed sale or other 
disposition of Collateral shall be required by law, such notice shall be 
deemed reasonable and proper if given at least ten (10) days before such 
sale or other disposition.


Section 6.7    Private Sales.


     (a)    Each Grantor recognizes that the Administrative Agent may be
     unable to effect a public sale of any or all the Pledged Stock, by
     reason of certain prohibitions contained in the Securities



20
------------------------------------------------------------------------


     Act and applicable state securities laws or otherwise, and may be
     compelled to resort to one or more private sales thereof to a
     restricted group of purchasers which will be obliged to agree, among
     other things, to acquire such securities for their own account for
     investment and not with a view to the distribution or resale thereof.
     Each Grantor acknowledges and agrees that any such private sale may
     result in prices and other terms less favorable than if such sale were
     a public sale and, notwithstanding such circumstances, agrees that any
     such private sale shall be deemed to have been made in a commercially
     reasonable manner. The Administrative Agent shall be under no
     obligation to delay a sale of any of the Pledged Stock for the period
     of time necessary to permit the Issuer thereof to register such
     securities for public sale under the Securities Act, or under
     applicable state securities laws, even if such Issuer would agree to
     do so.


     (b)    Each Grantor agrees to use its best efforts to do or cause to
     be done all such other acts as may be necessary to make such sale or
     sales of all or any portion of the Pledged Stock pursuant to this 
     Section 6.7 valid and binding and in compliance with any and all other
     applicable Requirements of Law. Each Grantor further agrees that a
     breach of any of the covenants contained in this Section 6.7 will
     cause irreparable injury to the Administrative Agent and the other
     Secured Parties, that the Administrative Agent and the other Secured
     Parties have no adequate remedy at law in respect of such breach and,
     as a consequence, that each and every covenant contained in this 
     Section 6.7 shall be specifically enforceable against such Grantor,
     and such Grantor hereby waives and agrees not to assert any defenses
     against an action for specific performance of such covenants except
     for a defense that no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing
     under the Credit Agreement or a defense of payment in full.


Section 6.8    Deficiency. Each Grantor shall remain liable for any 
deficiency if the proceeds of any sale or other disposition of the 
Collateral are insufficient to pay its Secured Obligations and the fees and 
disbursements of any attorneys employed by the Administrative Agent or any 
other Secured Party to collect such deficiency.


ARTICLE 7.
THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT


Section 7.1    Administrative Agent’s Appointment as Attorney-in-Fact, etc
.


     (a)    Each Grantor hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints the
     Administrative Agent and any officer or agent thereof, with full power
     of substitution, as its true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full
     irrevocable power and authority in the place and stead of such Grantor
     and in the name of such Grantor or in its own name, for the purpose of
     carrying out the terms of this Agreement, to take any and all
     appropriate action and to execute any and all documents and
     instruments which may be necessary or desirable to accomplish the
     purposes of this Agreement, and, without limiting the generality of
     the foregoing, each Grantor hereby gives the Administrative Agent the
     power and right, on behalf of such Grantor, without notice to or
     assent by such Grantor, to do any or all of the following:


      (i)         in the name of such Grantor or its own name, or
      otherwise, take possession of and indorse and collect any checks,
      drafts, notes, acceptances or other instruments for the payment of
      moneys due under any Receivable or with respect to any other
      Collateral and file any claim or take any other action or proceeding
      in any court of law or equity or otherwise deemed appropriate by the
      Administrative Agent for the purpose of collecting any and all such
      moneys due under any Receivable or with respect to any other
      Collateral whenever payable;


      (ii)    in the case of any Intellectual Property, execute and
      deliver, and have recorded, any



21
------------------------------------------------------------------------


      and all agreements, instruments, documents and papers as the
      Administrative Agent may request to evidence the Administrative
      Agent’s security interest in such Intellectual Property and the
      goodwill and general intangibles of such Grantor relating thereto or
      represented thereby;


      (iii)    pay or discharge taxes and Liens levied or placed on or
      threatened against the Collateral, effect any repairs or any
      insurance called for by the terms of this Agreement and pay all or
      any part of the premiums therefor and the costs thereof;


      (iv)    execute, in connection with any sale provided for in Section
      6.6 or Section 6.7, any indorsements, assignments or other
      instruments of conveyance or transfer with respect to the Collateral;
      and


      (v)    (1)  direct any party liable for any payment under any of the
      Collateral to make payment of any and all moneys due or to become due
      thereunder directly to the Administrative Agent or as the
      Administrative Agent shall direct; (2)   ask or demand for, collect,
      and receive payment of and receipt for, any and all moneys, claims
      and other amounts due or to become due at any time in respect of or
      arising out of any Collateral; (3)   sign and indorse any invoices,
      freight or express bills, bills of lading, storage or warehouse
      receipts, drafts against debtors, assignments, verifications, notices
      and other documents in connection with any of the Collateral; (4)
      commence and prosecute any suits, actions or proceedings at law or in
      equity in any court of competent jurisdiction to collect the
      Collateral or any portion thereof and to enforce any other right in
      respect of any Collateral; (5) defend any suit, action or proceeding
      brought against such Grantor with respect to any Collateral; (6)
      settle, compromise or adjust any such suit, action or proceeding and,
      in connection therewith, give such discharges or releases as the
      Administrative Agent may deem appropriate; (7) assign any Copyright,
      Patent or Trademark (along with the goodwill of the business to which
      any such Copyright, Patent or Trademark pertains), throughout the
      world for such term or terms, on such conditions, and in such manner,
      as the Administrative Agent shall in its sole discretion determine;
      and (8) generally, sell, transfer, pledge and make any agreement with
      respect to or otherwise deal with any of the Collateral as fully and
      completely as though the Administrative Agent were the absolute owner
      thereof for all purposes, and do, at the Administrative Agent’s
      option and such Grantor’s expense, at any time, or from time to time,
      all acts and things which the Administrative Agent deems necessary to
      protect, preserve or realize upon the Collateral and the
      Administrative Agent’s security interests therein and to effect the
      intent of this Agreement, all as fully and effectively as such
      Grantor might do.


Anything in this Section 7.1(a)  to the contrary notwithstanding, the 
Administrative Agent agrees that it will not exercise any rights under the 
power of attorney provided for in this Section 7.1(a) unless an Event of 
Default shall have occurred and be continuing.


     (b)    If any Grantor fails to perform or comply with any of its
     agreements contained herein, the Administrative Agent, at its option,
     but without any obligation so to do, may perform or comply, or
     otherwise cause performance or compliance, with such agreement.


     (c)    The expenses of the Administrative Agent incurred in connection
     with actions undertaken as provided in this Section 7.1, together with
     interest thereon at a rate per annum equal to the highest rate per
     annum at which interest would then be payable on any category of past
     due ABR Loans under the Credit Agreement, from the date of payment by
     the Administrative Agent to the date reimbursed by the relevant
     Grantor, shall be payable by such Grantor to the Administrative Agent
     on demand.



22
------------------------------------------------------------------------


     (d)    Each Grantor hereby ratifies all that said attorneys shall
     lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue hereof. All powers,
     authorizations and agencies contained in this Agreement are coupled
     with an interest and are irrevocable until this Agreement is
     terminated and the security interests created hereby are released.


Section 7.2    Duty of Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent’s 
sole duty with respect to the custody, safekeeping and physical 
preservation of the Collateral in its possession, under Section 9-207 of 
the New York UCC or otherwise, shall be to deal with it in the same manner 
as the Administrative Agent deals with similar property for its own 
account. Neither the Administrative Agent, any other Secured Party nor any 
of their respective officers, directors, employees or agents shall be 
liable for failure to demand, collect or realize upon any of the Collateral 
or for any delay in doing so or shall be under any obligation to sell or 
otherwise dispose of any Collateral upon the request of any Grantor or any 
other Person or to take any other action whatsoever with regard to the 
Collateral or any part thereof. The powers conferred on the Administrative 
Agent hereunder are solely to protect the Administrative Agent’s interests, 
on behalf of the Secured Parties, in the Collateral and shall not impose 
any duty upon the Administrative Agent to exercise any such powers. The 
Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties shall be accountable 
only for amounts that they actually receive as a result of the exercise of 
such powers, and neither they nor any of their officers, directors, 
employees or agents shall be responsible to any Grantor for any act or 
failure to act hereunder, except for their own gross negligence or willful 
misconduct.


Section 7.3    Authentication of Financing Statements. Each Grantor 
acknowledges that pursuant to Section 9-509(b) of the New York UCC and any 
other applicable law, by executing this Agreement such Grantor authorizes 
the Administrative Agent to file or record financing or continuation 
statements, and amendments thereto, and other filing or recording documents 
or instruments with respect to the Collateral, without the signature of 
such Grantor, in such form and in such offices as the Administrative Agent 
reasonably determines appropriate to perfect or maintain the perfection of 
the security interests of the Administrative Agent under this Agreement. 
Each Grantor further agrees that such financing statements may describe the 
collateral in the same manner as described in this Agreement or as “all 
assets,” “all personal property” or words of similar effect, regardless of 
whether or not the Collateral includes all assets or all personal property 
of such Grantor, or such other description as the Administrative Agent, in 
its sole judgment, determines is necessary or advisable that is of an equal 
or lesser scope or with greater detail.


Section 7.4    Authority of Administrative Agent. Each Grantor acknowledges 
that the rights and responsibilities of the Administrative Agent under this 
Agreement with respect to any action taken by the Administrative Agent or 
the exercise or non-exercise by the Administrative Agent of any option, 
voting right, request, judgment or other right or remedy provided for 
herein or resulting or arising out of this Agreement shall, as between the 
Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties, be governed by the 
Credit Agreement and by such other agreements with respect thereto as may 
exist from time to time among them, but, as between the Administrative 
Agent and the Grantors, the Administrative Agent shall be conclusively 
presumed to be acting as agent for the Secured Parties with full and valid 
authority so to act or refrain from acting, and no Grantor shall be under 
any obligation, or entitlement, to make any inquiry respecting such 
authority.


ARTICLE 8.
SUBORDINATION OF GRANTOR CLAIMS


Section 8.1    Subordination of Grantor Claims. As used herein, the term “
Grantor Claims” shall mean all debts and obligations of any Grantor to any 
other Grantor, whether such debts and obligations now exist or are 
hereafter incurred or arise, or whether the obligation of the debtor 
thereon be direct, contingent,



23
------------------------------------------------------------------------


primary, secondary, several, joint and several, or otherwise, and 
irrespective of whether such debts or obligations be evidenced by note, 
contract, open account, or otherwise, and irrespective of the Person or 
Persons in whose favor such debts or obligations may, at their inception, 
have been, or may hereafter be created, or the manner in which they have 
been or may hereafter be acquired by. After the occurrence and during the 
continuation of an Event of Default, and provided that the Administrative 
Agent has given such Grantor written notice of the Administrative Agent’s 
intent to exercise its rights pursuant to this Article 8, no Grantor shall 
receive or collect, directly or indirectly, from any obligor in respect 
thereof any amount upon the Grantor Claims.


Section 8.2    Claims in Bankruptcy. In the event of receivership, 
bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, debtor’s relief, or other 
insolvency proceedings involving any Grantor, the Administrative Agent on 
behalf of the Administrative Agent and the Secured Parties shall have the 
right, to the extent permitted by applicable law, to prove such Grantor’s 
claim in any proceeding with respect to Grantor Claims, so as to establish 
their rights hereunder and receive directly from the receiver, trustee or 
other court custodian, dividends and payments which would otherwise be 
payable upon Grantor Claims, and each Grantor hereby assigns such dividends 
and payments to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the 
Administrative Agent and the Secured Parties for application against the 
Obligations as provided under Section 8.2 of the Credit Agreement. Should 
the Administrative Agent or any Secured Party receive, for application upon 
the Obligations, any such dividend or payment which is otherwise payable to 
any Grantor, and which, as between such Grantors, shall constitute a credit 
upon the Grantor Claims, then upon the Release Date, the intended recipient 
shall become subrogated to the rights of the Administrative Agent and the 
Secured Parties to the extent that such payments to the Administrative 
Agent and the Secured Parties on the Grantor Claims have contributed toward 
the liquidation of the Obligations, and such subrogation shall be with 
respect to that proportion of the Obligations which would have been unpaid 
if the Administrative Agent and the Secured Parties had not received 
dividends or payments upon the Grantor Claims.


Section 8.3    Payments Held in Trust. In the event that, notwithstanding 
Section 8.1 and Section 8.2, any Grantor should receive any funds, 
payments, claims or distributions which is prohibited by such Sections, 
then it agrees: (a) to hold in trust for the Administrative Agent and the 
other Secured Parties an amount equal to the amount of all funds, payments, 
claims or distributions so received and (b) that it shall have absolutely 
no dominion over the amount of such funds, payments, claims or 
distributions except to pay them promptly to the Administrative Agent, for 
the benefit of the Secured Parties; and each Grantor covenants promptly to 
pay the same to the Administrative Agent.


Section 8.4    Liens Subordinate. Each Grantor agrees that, until the 
Release Date, any Liens securing payment of the Grantor Claims shall be and 
remain inferior and subordinate to any Liens securing payment of the 
Obligations, regardless of whether such encumbrances in favor of such 
Grantor, the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party presently 
exist or are hereafter created or attach. Without the prior written consent 
of the Administrative Agent, no Grantor shall, until the Release Date, (a) 
exercise or enforce any creditor’s right it may have against any debtor in 
respect of the Grantor Claims or (b) foreclose, repossess, sequester or 
otherwise take steps or institute any action or proceeding (judicial or 
otherwise, including without limitation the commencement of or joinder in 
any liquidation, bankruptcy, rearrangement, debtor’s relief or insolvency 
proceeding) to enforce any Lien held by it.


Section 8.5    Notation of Records. Upon the request of the Administrative 
Agent, all promissory notes and all accounts receivable ledgers or other 
evidence of the Grantor Claims accepted by or held by any Grantor shall 
contain a specific written notice thereon that the indebtedness evidenced 
thereby is subordinated under the terms of this Agreement.

ARTICLE 9.
MISCELLANEOUS


Section 9.1    Amendments in Writing. None of the terms or provisions of 
this Agreement may be waived, amended, supplemented or otherwise modified 
except in accordance with Section 10.1 of the Credit Agreement.


Section 9.2    Notices. All notices, requests and demands to or upon the 
Administrative Agent or any Grantor hereunder shall be effected in the 
manner provided for in Section 10.2 of the Credit Agreement; provided that 
any such notice, request or demand to or upon any Guarantor shall be 
addressed to such Guarantor at its notice address set forth on Schedule 1.


Section 9.3    No Waiver by Course of Conduct; Cumulative Remedies. Neither 
the Administrative Agent nor any other Secured Party shall by any act 
(except by a written instrument pursuant to Section 9.1), delay, 
indulgence, omission or otherwise be deemed to have waived any right or 
remedy hereunder or to have acquiesced in any Default or Event of Default. 
No failure to exercise, nor any delay in exercising, on the part of the 
Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party, any right, power or 
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof. No single or partial 
exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder shall preclude any 
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power 
or privilege. A waiver by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured 
Party of any right or remedy hereunder on any one occasion shall not be 
construed as a bar to any right or remedy which the Administrative Agent or 
such other Secured Party would otherwise have on any future occasion. The 
rights and remedies herein provided are cumulative, may be exercised singly 
or concurrently and are not exclusive of any other rights or remedies 
provided by law.


Section 9.4    Enforcement Expenses; Indemnification.


     (a)    Each Grantor agrees to pay or reimburse the Administrative
     Agent and each other Secured Party for all advances, charges, costs
     and expenses (including, without limitation, all costs and expenses of
     holding, preparing for sale and selling, collecting or otherwise
     realizing upon the Collateral and all attorneys’ fees, legal expenses
     and court costs) incurred by the Administrative Agent or any other
     Secured Party in connection with the exercise of its respective rights
     and remedies hereunder, including, without limitation, any advances,
     charges, costs and expenses that may be incurred in any effort to
     enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement or any obligation of
     any Grantor in respect of the Collateral or in connection with (i) the
     preservation of the Lien of, or the rights of the Administrative Agent
     or any other Secured Party under this Agreement, (ii) any actual or
     attempted sale, lease, disposition, exchange, collection, compromise,
     settlement or other realization in respect of, or care of, the
     Collateral, including all such costs and expenses incurred in any
     bankruptcy, reorganization, workout or other similar proceeding, or
     (iii) collecting against any Guarantor under the guarantee contained
     in Article 2 or otherwise enforcing or preserving any rights under
     this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which any Grantor is a
     party, including, without limitation, the fees and disbursements of
     counsel (including the allocated fees and expenses of in-house
     counsel) to each Secured Party and of counsel to the Administrative
     Agent.


     (b)    Each Grantor agrees to pay, and to save the Administrative
     Agent and the other Secured Parties harmless from, any and all
     liabilities with respect to, or resulting from any delay in paying,
     any and all Other Taxes which may be payable or determined to be
     payable with respect to any of the Collateral or in connection with
     any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

     Agent and the other Secured Parties harmless from, any and all
     liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions,
     judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or
     nature whatsoever (including, without limitation, court costs and
     attorneys’ fees, any and all liabilities with respect to, or resulting
     from any delay in paying, any and all stamp, excise, sales or other
     taxes which may be payable or determined to be payable with respect to
     any of the Collateral or in connection with any of the transactions
     contemplated by this Agreement) incurred because of, incident to, or
     with respect to, the Collateral (including, without limitation, any
     exercise of rights or remedies in connection therewith) and the
     execution, delivery, enforcement, performance and administration of
     this Agreement to the extent, but only to the extent, that the
     Borrower would be required to do so pursuant to Section 2.13, Section
     2.14 or Section 10.5 of the Credit Agreement. All amounts for which
     any Grantor is liable pursuant to this Section 9.4 shall be due and
     payable by such Grantor to the Secured Parties within ten (10) days
     after demand therefor.

     under the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents.


Section 9.5    Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon 
the successors and assigns of each Grantor and shall inure to the benefit

prior written consent of the Administrative Agent.


Section 9.6    Set-Off. In addition to any rights and remedies of the 
Secured Parties provided by law, each Secured Party shall have the right, 
without notice to any Grantor, any such notice being expressly waived by 
each Grantor to the extent permitted by applicable law, upon any Secured 
Obligations becoming due and payable by any Grantor (whether at the stated 
maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), to apply to the payment of such 
Secured Obligations, by setoff or otherwise, any and all deposits (general 
or special, time or demand, provisional or final), in any currency, and any 
other credits, indebtedness or claims, in any currency, in each case 
whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, matured or unmatured, 
at any time held or owing by such Secured Party, any affiliate thereof or 
any of their respective branches or agencies to or for the credit or the 
account of such Grantor. Each Secured Party agrees promptly to notify the 
relevant Grantor and the Administrative Agent after any such application 
made by such Secured Party; provided that the failure to give such notice 
shall not affect the validity of such application.


Section 9.7    Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed by one or more 
of the parties to this Agreement on any number of separate counterparts, 
and all of said counterparts taken together shall be deemed to constitute 
one and the same instrument. Delivery of an executed signature page of this

Section 9.12    Jurisdiction.


     (a)    Each party hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
     submits, for itself and its property, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction
     of the courts of the Supreme Court of the State of New York, sitting
     in New York County and of the United States District Court of the

     recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties
     hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims
     in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and
     determined in such New York State court or, to the extent permitted by
     law, in such Federal court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a
     final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive
     and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or
     in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement or any

     Secured Party may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding
     relating to this Agreement against the Borrower or its properties in
     the courts of any jurisdiction. Each of the parties hereto agrees that

     the other Loan Documents, and the relationship between the Grantors,
     on the one hand, and the Administrative Agent and the other Secured
     Parties, on the other hand, in connection herewith or therewith is
     solely that of debtor and creditor; and

Section 9.15    Releases.


     (a)    Upon the Release Date, the Collateral shall be released from

     Administrative Agent and each Grantor hereunder shall terminate, all
     without delivery of any instrument or performance of any act by any
     party, and all rights to the Collateral shall revert to the Grantors.
     At the request and sole expense of any Grantor following any such
     termination, the Administrative Agent shall deliver to such Grantor
     any Collateral held by the Administrative Agent hereunder, and execute

     Grantor all releases or other documents reasonably necessary or
     desirable for the release of the Liens created hereby on such
     Collateral. At the request and sole expense of the Borrower, a

applicable pursuant to Section 9-620 of the New York UCC, no action taken 
or omission to act by the Administrative Agent or the other Secured Parties 
hereunder, including, without limitation, any exercise of voting or 
consensual rights or any other action taken or inaction, shall be deemed to 
constitute a retention of the Collateral in satisfaction of the Obligations 
or otherwise to be in full satisfaction of the Obligations, and the 
Obligations shall remain in full force and effect, until the Administrative 
Agent and the other Secured Parties shall have applied payments



28

Obligations in the full amount then outstanding or until such subsequent 
time as is provided in Section 6.5.


Section 9.18    Reinstatement. The obligations of each Grantor under this 
Agreement (including, without limitation, with respect to the guarantee 
contained in Article 2 and the provision of collateral herein) shall 
continue to be effective, or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any 
time payment, or any part thereof, of any of the Secured Obligations is 
rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned by the Administrative 
Agent or any other Secured Party upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, 
dissolution, liquidation or reorganization of the Borrower or any other 
Grantor, or upon or as a result of the appointment of a receiver, 
intervenor or conservator of, or trustee or similar officer for, the 
Borrower or any other Grantor or any substantial part of its property, or 
otherwise, all as though such payments had not been made.

ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO 
ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND

partner of the Borrower, shall not be liable for the obligations of the

Borrower that requires the General Partner to restore a capital account 
deficit.

Agreement and any Notes issued in connection therewith have been given in

Party is a party or by which any Opinion Party or any of its property is 
bound except that we have not made such assumption with respect to the 
Organizational Documents to the extent of our opinion in paragraph 5(a) 
below.
On the basis of the foregoing, and subject to the exceptions, 
qualifications and limitations set forth below, we are of the opinion that:


1.
(a)    Borrower is a limited partnership validly existing and in good 
standing under the laws
            of the State of Delaware.


      (b)
Each of the TX LLC Opinion Parties is a limited liability company validly 
existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Texas.

company validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State 
of Delaware.
      (d)
Each of the DE Corporate Opinion Parties is a corporation validly existing 
and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.
2.
(a)    Borrower has the limited partnership power to execute and deliver, 
and to perform its
              obligations under, each of the Opinion Documents to which
              Borrower is a party.

      (b)
Each of the LLC Opinion Parties (as defined in Part B of Schedule II 
hereto) has the limited liability company power to execute and deliver, and 
to perform its obligations under, each of the Opinion Documents to which 
such LLC Opinion Party is a party. BKEP GP has the limited liability 
company power to act as

------------------------------------------------------------------------
[bb.jpg]- 4 - May 11, 2017

            general partner of Borrower and, in such capacity, to execute
            on behalf of Borrower each Opinion Document to which Borrower
            is a party.


      (c)
Each of the DE Corporate Opinion Parties has the corporate power to execute 
and deliver, and to perform its obligations under, each of the Opinion 
Documents to which such DE Corporate Opinion Party is a party.
3.
Each Opinion Document to which an Opinion Party is a party has been duly 
authorized by all necessary limited liability company, limited partnership 
or corporate action, as applicable, by or on behalf of such Opinion Party, 
including any requisite authorizing action by BKEP GP (in its capacity as 
the general partner of Borrower).
4.
Each Opinion Document to which an Opinion Party is a party has been duly 
executed and delivered by such Opinion Party.
5.
The execution and delivery by each of the Opinion Parties of the Opinion 
Documents to which it is a party do not, and the performance by such 
Opinion Party of its obligations thereunder will not, (a) violate any of 
the Organizational Documents of such Opinion Party or (b) violate 
Applicable Law (as defined below).
6.
No Governmental Approval (as defined below) which has not been obtained is 
required to be obtained by any Opinion Party as a condition to the 
execution or delivery of the Opinion Documents by the Opinion Parties, the 
borrowings thereunder, the creation of security interests pursuant thereto 
or the performance by the Opinion Parties of their payment obligations 
thereunder.
7.
The Guarantee and Collateral Agreement is effective under the Uniform 
Commercial Code as in effect on the date hereof in the State of New York 
(the “New York UCC”) to create in favor of the Administrative Agent for the 
benefit of the Secured Parties a valid security interest (the “Article 9 
Security Interest”) in the right, title and interest of each Opinion Party 
that is a party thereto in the Collateral (as defined in the Guarantee and 
Collateral Agreement) to the extent that such Collateral constitutes 
collateral in which a security interest may be created under Article 9 of 
the New York UCC (the “Article 9 Collateral”), which security interest 
secures the respective Secured Obligations (as defined in the Guarantee and 
Collateral Agreement) of such Opinion Party.
8.
Each Opinion Document constitutes a valid and binding obligation of each 
Opinion Party that is a party thereto, enforceable against each such 
Opinion Party in accordance with its terms.
9.
(a)    Assuming that none of the Delaware Financing Statements (as defined 
in Part B of Schedule
            II hereto) has been terminated, amended or otherwise lapsed,
            the Article 9 Security Interest in that portion of the Article
            9 Collateral in which a security interest may be perfected by
            the filing of a financing statement under the Uniform
            Commercial Code as in effect on the date hereof in the State of
            Delaware (without consideration of any judicial or
            administrative interpretations thereof)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
[bb.jpg]- 5 - May 11, 2017

            (the “Delaware UCC”) is perfected by the filing of the Delaware
            Financing Statements.


      (b)
Assuming that none of the Texas Financing Statements (as defined in Part B 
of Schedule II hereto) has been terminated, amended or otherwise lapsed, 
the Article 9 Security Interest in that portion of the Article 9 Collateral 
in which a security interest may be perfected by the filing of a financing 
statement under the Texas Business and Commerce Code as in effect on the 
date hereof in the State of Texas (the “Texas UCC”) is perfected by the 
filing of the Texas Financing Statements.
10.
Neither BKEP GP nor any of the Opinion Parties is required to register as 
an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
11.
Based upon the representations and warranties in Section 4.11 of the Credit 
Agreement, the making of the Loans to Borrower and the use of the proceeds 
of the Loans as contemplated by the Credit Agreement will not violate 
Regulation U or X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
as in effect on the date hereof (“Regulation U and X”).
The foregoing opinions are subject to the following assumptions, 
exceptions, qualifications and limitations:


(a)    As used herein, “Applicable Law” means (i) for purposes of our 
opinions in (A) paragraphs 4, 7 and 8, the law of the State of New York and 
(B) paragraphs 5(b) and 6, the laws of the State of New York and the 
federal law of the United States of America, in each case that a New York 
lawyer exercising customary professional diligence would reasonably be 
expected to recognize as being applicable to the Opinion Parties, the 
Opinion Documents or the transactions contemplated by the Opinion 
Documents, without regard to the particular nature of the business or 
assets of any Opinion Party or its affiliates, (ii) solely for purposes of 
our opinions in paragraphs 1, 2, 3 and 5(a), the General Corporation Law of 
the State of Delaware, the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act, the 
Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act and the Texas Limited 
Liability Company Act, as applicable (without consideration of any judicial 
or administrative interpretations thereof other than with respect to the 
Texas Limited Liability Company Act), (iii) solely for purposes of our 
opinion in paragraph 9(b), Chapter 9 of the Texas UCC, (iv) solely for 
purposes of our opinion in paragraph 9(a), Article 9 of the Delaware UCC, 
and (v) solely for purposes of our opinion in each of paragraphs 10 and 11, 
the federal law of the United States of America specifically referenced in 
such opinion.


(b)    As used herein, “Governmental Approval” means any consent, approval, 
license, authorization or validation of, or filing, recording or 
registration with, any United States federal or New York state governmental 
authority or regulatory body pursuant to any Applicable Law.


(c)    In rendering the opinions set forth in paragraph 1 above, to the 
extent such relate to the valid existence and good standing of (i) each 
Opinion Party (other than the TX LLC Opinion Parties) and BKEP GP, we have 
relied solely upon certificates issued as of a recent date



------------------------------------------------------------------------
[bb.jpg]- 6 - May 11, 2017

by public officials of the State of Delaware, and (ii) each TX LLC Opinion 
Party, we have relied solely upon certificates issued as of a recent date 
by public officials of the State of Texas and statements of Franchise Tax 
Account Status obtained as of a recent date through the website of the 
Office of the Comptroller of Public Accounts of Texas, which statements 
indicate that, as of a recent date, the right of each such TX LLC Opinion 
Party to transact business in Texas is “active”.


(d)    Our opinions are subject to the effect of (i) applicable bankruptcy, 
insolvency, reorganization, arrangement, fraudulent transfer or conveyance, 
preference, moratorium, conservatorship and similar laws relating to or 
affecting creditors’ rights and remedies generally, (ii) general principles 
of equity (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), 
including, without limitation, the possible unavailability of specific 
performance, injunctive relief or any other equitable remedy and (iii) 
principles of materiality and reasonableness and implied covenants of good 
faith and fair dealing.


(e)    Certain of the remedial, waiver, consent and other provisions of the 
Guarantee and Collateral Agreement may be further limited or rendered 
unenforceable under existing laws or judicial decisions. However, subject 
to the other express qualifications contained herein, such laws or judicial 
decisions do not, in our opinion, substantially interfere with the 
practical realization of the principal benefits expressed in the Guarantee 
and Collateral Agreement, except for the economic consequences of any 
procedural delay that might result from such laws or decisions.


(f)    We express no opinion as to the enforceability of any provision in 
the Opinion Documents, to the extent relating to: (i) any failure to comply 
with requirements concerning notices, relating to delay or omission to 
enforce rights or remedies or purporting to waive or affect rights, claims, 
defenses or other benefits to the extent that any of the same cannot be 
waived or so affected under Section 1-302(b), 9-602 or 9-603 of the New 
York UCC or other provisions of applicable law; (ii) indemnities or 
exculpation from liability to the extent prohibited by federal or state 
laws and the public policies underlying those laws or that might require 
indemnification for, or exculpation from liability on account of, gross 
negligence, willful misconduct, unlawful acts, violations of securities 
laws, fraud or illegality of an indemnified or exculpated party; (iii) the 
disregard of any course of dealing between the parties; (iv) an attempt to 
grant to any party conclusive rights of determination; (v) an attempt to 
confer subject matter jurisdiction on any federal court of the United 
States; (vi) methods or procedures for service of process; (vii) a waiver 
of any objection based on inappropriate venue or forum non conveniens in 
any federal court of the United States; (viii) the establishment of 
evidentiary standards; (ix) the severability of unenforceable provisions 
from the Opinion Documents to the extent that the enforcement of remaining 
provisions would frustrate the fundamental intent of the parties; (x) the 
preservation of the solvency of any guarantor, pledgor or grantor by 
purporting to limit (by formula or otherwise) the amount of the liability 
of, or to provide rights of contribution or subrogation in favor of, such 
guarantor, pledgor or grantor; (xi) any guaranty provided by, or any joint 
and several liability imposed upon, or the grant of a Lien by, any person 
or entity that is not an “eligible contract participant” within the meaning 
of Section 1a(18) of the Commodity Exchange Act, insofar as such guaranty 
or such joint and several liability covers, or such Lien



------------------------------------------------------------------------
[bb.jpg]- 7 - May 11, 2017

secures, an agreement, contract or transaction that constitutes a “swap” 
within the meaning of Section 1a(47) of the Commodity Exchange Act; (xii) 
forfeitures, liquidated damages, prepayment or make-whole premiums, default 
interest, late charges or other economic remedies to the extent such 
provisions are deemed to constitute penalties; (xiii) the grant of any 
right of set-off to the extent that such right can be exercised without 
notice or with respect to any contingent or unmatured obligation or by or 
against any Person that is not a party to the Opinion Documents; or (xiv) 
provisions relating to any “bail-in” regulations or requirements related 
thereto of any jurisdiction, including, without limitation, the European 
Union, any member state of the European Union, Iceland, Lichtenstein and 
Norway.


(g)    We express no opinion as to the effect of any state or federal 
securities laws, rules or regulations insofar as they are applicable to or 
otherwise affect any party to the Opinion Documents, the transactions 
contemplated by the Opinion Documents or the exercise of any rights or 
remedies of any party to the Opinion Documents, other than the Investment 
Company Act of 1940, as amended, to the extent specifically covered by our 
opinion in paragraph 10 above, and Regulation U and X to the extent 
specifically covered by our opinion in paragraph 11 above.


(h)    We express no opinion as to the effect on the opinions expressed 
herein of (i) the compliance or non-compliance of any of the Secured 
Parties with any state, federal or other laws, rules or regulations 
applicable to it, (ii) the legal or regulatory status or the nature of the 
business of any of the Secured Parties, (iii) other facts specifically 
pertaining to the Secured Parties or (iv) any state, federal or other laws, 
rules or regulations or orders that may be applicable as a result of the 
involvement of the Secured Parties in the transactions contemplated by any 
of the Opinion Documents or because of the legal or regulatory status or 
the nature of the business of any of the Secured Parties.


(i)    We call to your attention that Section 552 of the Bankruptcy Code 
(11 U.S.C. § 101 et seq.) limits the extent to which proceeds realized and 
property acquired by a debtor after the commencement of a case under such 
Code may be subject to a security interest arising from a security 
agreement entered into by the debtor before the commencement of that case.


(j)    Our opinions in paragraphs 7 and 9 above are subject to the 
following qualifications and limitations:


      (i)    Our opinion in paragraph 7 is limited to Article 9 of the New
      York UCC, our opinion in paragraph 9(a) is limited to Article 9 of
      the Delaware UCC and our opinion in paragraph 9(b) is limited to
      Chapter 9 of the Texas UCC. We express no opinion as to any property
      or transaction that is excluded from the scope of Chapter 9 of the
      Texas UCC by Section 9.109 thereof or from the scope of Article 9 of
      the New York UCC or the Delaware UCC by Section 9-109 thereof or as
      to the perfection of any security interest by a means other than
      those described in paragraph 9.


      (ii)    We express no opinion as to the creation of a security
      interest in any collateral to the extent that the description of such
      collateral does not reasonably identify



------------------------------------------------------------------------
[bb.jpg]- 8 - May 11, 2017

      the property purported to be described thereby in accordance with
      Section 9-108 of the New York UCC.


      (iii)    In the case of proceeds (as such term is used in Section
      9.102 of the Texas UCC and Section 9-102 of each of the New York UCC
      and the Delaware UCC, respectively), including that portion of the
      collateral under the Opinion Documents that constitutes proceeds,
      continuation of perfection is limited to the extent set forth in
      Section 9.315 of the Texas UCC and Section 9-315 of the New York UCC
      and the Delaware UCC, respectively.


      (iv)    We express no opinion with respect to any actions that may be
      required to be taken periodically after the date hereof under the New
      York UCC, the Texas UCC or the Delaware UCC in order for the
      effectiveness of the Financing Statements or perfection of any
      security interest to be maintained.


(k)    We express no opinion as to (i) the priority of the liens and 
security interests created by the Opinion Documents with respect to any 
collateral thereunder, (ii) the filing or recording of the Opinion 
Documents, the Financing Statements or any other instruments relating 
thereto, other than to the extent set forth in our opinion in paragraph 9 
above, (iii) whether the properties described in the Guarantee and 
Collateral Agreement are the properties and interests intended by the 
Secured Parties to be encumbered thereby, or (iv) the creation or 
perfection of a security interest in any collateral consisting of 
commercial tort claims, consumer goods, cooperative interests, farm 
products, fixtures, timber to be cut, and minerals and the like (including 
as-extracted collateral).


(l)    We call to your attention that the perfection, effect of perfection 
and non-perfection, and the priority, of the security interests created 
under the Opinion Documents may be governed by laws other than the laws of 
the State of Texas, the State of New York or the State Delaware. In this 
regard, among other things, we call your attention to Section 9.311 of the 
Texas UCC and Section 9-311 of each of the New York UCC and the Delaware 
UCC relating to the perfection of security interests in property subject to 
certain statutes, regulations and treaties.


(m)    Our opinions expressed above are limited to Applicable Law, and no 
opinion is expressed as to any other law. We undertake no, and hereby 
disclaim any, obligation or responsibility to update or supplement this 
opinion letter in response to changes in law or facts or the occurrence of 
developments or events after the date hereof affecting any transaction 
contemplated by any Opinion Document or any opinion expressed herein.


This opinion letter is rendered solely for your benefit in connection with 
the transactions contemplated by the Opinion Documents to be consummated on 
this date. This opinion letter may not be used for any other purpose, or 
relied upon by any other person, firm or entity, without, in each instance, 
our prior written consent. At your request, we hereby consent to reliance 
hereon by any future Lender under the Credit Agreement that becomes a party 
thereto pursuant to an assignment that is made and consented to in 
accordance with the express provisions of Section 10.6(b) of the Credit 
Agreement, in each case on the condition and

------------------------------------------------------------------------
[bb.jpg]- 9 - May 11, 2017

understanding that (i) this opinion letter speaks only as of the date 
hereof, (ii) we have no responsibility or obligation to update this opinion 
letter to consider its applicability or correctness to such future Lender, 
(iii) in no event shall any future Lender have any greater rights with 
respect hereto than the original addressees of this opinion letter on the 
date hereof nor, in the case of any future Lender that becomes a Lender by 
assignment, any greater rights than its assignor, (iv) in furtherance and 
not in limitation of the foregoing, our consent to such reliance shall in 
no event constitute a reissuance of the opinions expressed herein or 
otherwise extend any statute of limitations period applicable hereto on the 
date hereof, and (v) any such reliance by any such future Lender also must 
be actual and reasonable under the circumstances existing at the time of 
its becoming a Lender, including any changes in law or facts, or any other 
developments or events known to or reasonably knowable by such future 
Lender at such time.


Very truly yours,
