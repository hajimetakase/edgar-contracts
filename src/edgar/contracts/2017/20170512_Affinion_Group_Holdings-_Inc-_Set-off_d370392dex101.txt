------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 2.02 Loans and Borrowings.

(a) Each Loan shall be made as part of a Borrowing consisting of Loans of 
the same Class and Type made by the Lenders ratably in accordance with 
their respective Commitments of the applicable Class (or, in the case of 
Swingline Loans, in accordance with their respective Swingline 
Commitments).

(b) Subject to Section 2.14, each Borrowing (other than a Swingline 
Borrowing) shall be comprised entirely of ABR Loans or Eurocurrency Loans 
as the Borrower may request in accordance herewith. Each Swingline 
Borrowing shall be an ABR Borrowing. Each Lender at its option may make any 
ABR Loan or Eurocurrency Loan by causing any domestic or foreign branch or 
Affiliate of such Lender to make such Loan; provided, that any exercise of 
such option shall not affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay such 
Loan in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and such Lender shall 
not be entitled to any amounts payable under Section 2.15 or 2.17 solely in 
respect of increased costs or taxes resulting from such exercise and 
existing at the time of such exercise.

(c) At the commencement of each Interest Period for any Eurocurrency 
Revolving Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount that is 
an integral multiple of the Borrowing Multiple and not less than the 
Borrowing Minimum. At the time that (i) each ABR Revolving Borrowing is 
made, such Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount that is an integral 
multiple of the Borrowing Multiple and not less than the Borrowing Minimum; 
provided, that an ABR Revolving Borrowing may be in an aggregate amount 
that is equal to the entire unused balance of the Revolving Commitments or 
that is required to finance the reimbursement of an L/C Disbursement as 
contemplated by Section 2.05(e). Borrowings of more than one Type and Class 
may be outstanding at the same time; provided, that there shall not at any 
time be more than a total of (i) ten Eurocurrency Borrowings outstanding 
under each Class of Term Loans and (ii) ten Eurocurrency Borrowings 
outstanding under each Class of Revolving Facility Loans.

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Borrower shall 
not be entitled to request, or to elect to convert or continue, any 
Borrowing if the Interest Period requested with respect thereto would end 
after the Revolving Facility Maturity Date or Term Loan Maturity Date or 
other final stated maturity date of any other Class of Loans, as 
applicable.

SECTION 2.03 Requests for Borrowings. To request a Revolving Facility 
Borrowing and/or a Term Borrowing, the Borrower shall notify the 
Administrative Agent of such request (as provided in Section 9.01) in 
writing by providing a Borrowing Request in the form of Exhibit C-1 hereto 
(a) in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, not later than 12:00 p.m., 
Local Time, four Business Days before the date of the proposed Borrowing, 
(b) in the case of an ABR Term Loan Borrowing, not later than 12:00 p.m., 
Local Time, four Business Day before the date of the proposed Borrowing, 
and (c) in the case of an ABR Revolving Borrowing, not later than 12:00 
p.m., Local Time, four Business Days before the date of the proposed 
Borrowing; provided, that any such notice of an ABR Revolving Borrowing to 
finance the reimbursement of an L/C Disbursement as contemplated by 
Section 2.05(e) may be given not later than 11:00 a.m., Local Time, on the 
date of the proposed Borrowing. Each such written Borrowing Request shall 
be irrevocable and shall be provided by electronic mail or telecopy to the 
Administrative Agent. Each such written Borrowing Request shall specify the 
following information in compliance with Section 2.02:
 
-54-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(i) the Class of such Borrowing;

(ii) the aggregate amount of the requested Borrowing;

(iii) the date of such Borrowing, which shall be a Business Day;

(iv) whether such Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurocurrency 
Borrowing;

(v) in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, the initial Interest Period to 
be applicable thereto, which shall be a period contemplated by the 
definition of the term Interest Period; and

(vi) the location and number of the Borrowers account to which funds are 
to be disbursed.

If no election as to the Type of Term Borrowing or Revolving Facility 
Borrowing is specified (as applicable), then the requested Revolving 
Facility Borrowing shall be an ABR Borrowing. If no Interest Period is 
specified with respect to any requested Eurocurrency Borrowing, then the 
Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one months 
duration. Promptly following receipt of a Borrowing Request in accordance 
with this Section, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the 
details thereof and of the amount of such Lenders Loan to be made as part 
of the requested Borrowing.

SECTION 2.04 Swingline Loans.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Swingline 
Lender may, in its sole discretion, make Swingline Loans in U.S. Dollars to 
the Borrower from time to time during the Revolving Availability Period, in 
an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding that will not result 
in (i) the Swingline Exposure exceeding the Swingline Commitment or (ii) 
the Revolving Facility Exposure plus the face amount of letters of credit 
issued under Section 6.01(s) exceeding the total Revolving Facility 
Commitments; provided, that the Swingline Lender shall not be required to 
make a Swingline Loan to refinance an outstanding Swingline Borrowing. Each 
Swingline Borrowing shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of 
an amount to be agreed between the Borrower and Swingline Lender, and not 
less than an amount to be agreed between the Borrower and Swingline Lender. 
Within the foregoing limits and subject to the terms and conditions set 
forth herein, the Borrower may borrow, prepay and reborrow Swingline Loans.

(b) To request a Swingline Borrowing, the Borrower shall notify the 
Administrative Agent and the Swingline Lender of such request in writing 
(which may be by electronic mail) in the form of a Swingline Borrowing 
Request, not later than 11:00 a.m., Local Time, on the day of a proposed 
Swingline Borrowing. Each such notice and Swingline Borrowing Request shall 
be irrevocable and shall specify (i) the requested date (which shall be a 
Business Day) and (ii) the amount of the requested Swingline Borrowing. The 
Swingline Lender shall consult with the Administrative Agent as to whether 
the making of the Swingline Loan is in accordance with the terms of this 
Agreement prior to the Swingline Lender funding such Swingline Loan. The 
Swingline Lender shall make each Swingline Loan to be made by it
 
-55-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
hereunder in accordance with Section 2.02(a) on the proposed date thereof 
by wire transfer of immediately available funds by 3:00 p.m., Local Time, 
to the account of the Borrower (or, in the case of a Swingline Borrowing 
made to finance the reimbursement of an L/C Disbursement as provided in 
Section 2.05(e), by remittance to the applicable Issuing Bank).

(c) The Swingline Lender may by written notice given to the Administrative 
Agent not later than 12:00 p.m., Local Time, in its sole discretion, four 
Business Days before the date of the proposed participations, require the 
Revolving Facility Lenders to acquire participations in all or a portion of 
the outstanding Swingline Loans made by it. Such notice shall specify the 
aggregate amount of such Swingline Loans in which the Revolving Facility 
Lenders will participate. Promptly upon receipt of such notice, the 
Administrative Agent will give notice thereof to each such Revolving 
Facility Lender, specifying in such notice such Revolving Facility Lenders 
Applicable Percentage of such Swingline Loan or Loans. Each Revolving 
Facility Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees, upon receipt 
of notice as provided above, to pay to the Administrative Agent for the 
account of the Swingline Lender, such Revolving Facility Lenders 
Applicable Percentage of such Swingline Loan or Loans (and the 
Administrative Agent may apply Cash Collateral available with respect to 
the applicable Swingline Loan). Each Revolving Facility Lender acknowledges 
and agrees that its respective obligation to acquire participations in 
Swingline Loans pursuant to this paragraph is absolute and unconditional 
and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including the 
occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the 
Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, 
abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Each Revolving Facility 
Lender shall comply with its obligation under this paragraph by wire 
transfer of immediately available funds, in the same manner as provided in 
Section 2.06 with respect to Loans made by such Revolving Facility Lender 
(and Section 2.06 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations 
of the Revolving Facility Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall 
promptly pay to the Swingline Lender the amounts so received by it from the 
Revolving Facility Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall notify the 
Borrower of any participations in any Swingline Loan acquired pursuant to 
this paragraph (c), and thereafter payments in respect of such Swingline 
Loan shall be made to the Administrative Agent and not to the Swingline 
Lender. Any amounts received by the Swingline Lender from the Borrower (or 
other party on behalf of the Borrower) in respect of a Swingline Loan after 
receipt by the Swingline Lender of the proceeds of a sale of participations 
therein shall be promptly remitted to the Administrative Agent; any such 
amounts received by the Administrative Agent shall be promptly remitted by 
the Administrative Agent to the Revolving Facility Lenders that shall have 
made their payments pursuant to this paragraph and to the Swingline Lender, 
as their interests may appear; provided, that any such payment so remitted 
shall be repaid to the Swingline Lender or to the Administrative Agent, as 
applicable, if and to the extent such payment is required to be refunded to 
the Borrower for any reason. The purchase of participations in a Swingline 
Loan pursuant to this paragraph shall not relieve the Borrower of any 
default in the payment thereof.

(d) The Swingline Lender may be replaced at any time by written agreement 
among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the replaced Swingline Lender 
and the successor Swingline Lender. The Administrative Agent shall notify 
the Lenders of any such replacement of the Swingline Lender. At the time 
any such replacement shall become effective, the Borrower shall pay all 
unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced Swingline Lender. From 
and after the effective date of any such replacement, (i) the successor 
Swingline Lender shall have all
 
-56-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
the rights and obligations of the replaced Swingline Lender under this 
Agreement with respect to Swingline Loans to be extended thereafter and 
(ii) references herein to the term Swingline Lender shall be deemed to 
refer to such successor or to any previous Swingline Lender, or to such 
successor and all previous Swingline Lenders, as the context shall require. 
After the replacement of a Swingline Lender hereunder, the replaced 
Swingline Lender shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all 
the rights and obligations of such Swingline Loans under this Agreement 
with respect to Swingline Loans extended by it prior to such replacement 
but shall not be required to extend any additional Swingline Loans.

(e) From time to time, HPS (in its sole discretion) may agree to act as the 
Swingline Lender pursuant to a written agreement among the Borrower, the 
Administrative Agent and HPS, provided that notwithstanding such written 
agreement or anything herein to contrary, if at any time HPS is unable act 
as the Swingline Lender or cannot act as the Swingline Lender without undue 
burden or without incurring incremental fees, costs or expenses of a 
non-de minimis nature then HPS may, upon written notice (Swingline 
Resignation Notice) to the Borrower and Administrative Agent, immediately 
resign from its role as Swingline Lender. After any potential resignation 
of HPS hereunder, HPS shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to 
have all the rights and obligations of such Swingline Loans under this 
Agreement with respect to Swingline Loans extended by it prior to such 
resignation but shall not be required to extend any additional Swingline 
Loans. Such Swingline Resignation Notice shall also serve as a notice to 
the Revolving Facility Lenders pursuant to Section 2.04(c) and the 
Revolving Facility Lenders hereby agree to acquire participations in such 
Swingline Loans in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.04(c).

SECTION 2.05 Letters of Credit.

(a) General. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, (i) each 
Issuing Bank agrees (and in the case of HPS, solely with respect to this 
clause (i), to the extent HPS agrees to act as an Issuing Bank, at its sole 
discretion), in reliance upon the agreements of the Revolving Facility 
Lenders set forth in this Section 2.05, from time to time on any Business 
day during the Revolving Availability Period and prior to the date that is 
thirty days prior to the Revolving Facility Maturity Date, to issue Letters 
of Credit for the account of the Borrower or its Subsidiaries, and to amend 
Letters of Credit previously issued by it, in accordance with subsection 
(b) below, and to honor drawings of Letters of Credit; and (ii) the 
Revolving Facility Lenders severally agree to participate in Letters of 
Credit issued for the account of the Borrower or its Subsidiaries and any 
drawings thereunder; provided that after giving effect to any issuance of 
any Letter of Credit, (x) the total Revolving Facility Exposure plus the 
face amount of letters of credit issued under Section 6.01(s) shall not 
exceed the total Revolving Facility Commitments, (y) the Revolving Facility 
Exposure of any Revolving Facility Lender shall not exceed such Revolving 
Facility Lenders respective Revolving Facility Commitment, and (z) the L/C 
Exposure shall not exceed the aggregate L/C Commitments. Each request by 
the Borrower for the issuance or amendment of a Letter of Credit shall be 
deemed to be a representation by the Borrower that the issuance or 
amendment of such Letter of Credit so requested complies with the 
conditions set forth in the proviso to the preceding sentence. Within the 
foregoing limits, and subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the 
Borrowers ability to obtain Letters of Credit shall be fully revolving, 
and accordingly the Borrower may, during the foregoing period, obtain 
Letters of Credit to replace Letters of Credit that have expired or that 
have been drawn upon and
 
-57-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
reimbursed. In the event of any inconsistency between the terms and 
conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of any form of 
Letter of Credit Application or other agreement submitted by the Borrower 
to, or entered into by the Borrower with, an Issuing Bank relating to any 
Letter of Credit (collectively, the Issuer Documents), the terms and 
conditions of this Agreement shall control. To the extent that HPS agrees 
to act as an Issuing Bank, it is understood and agreed it may satisfy its 
obligations hereunder with respect to the issuance of Letters of Credit by 
causing a Third Party LC Issuer to issue such Letters of Credit.

(b) Notice of Issuance, Amendment, Renewal, Extension. (i) Each Letter of 
Credit shall be issued or amended, as the case may be, upon the request of 
the Borrower delivered to the applicable Issuing Bank (with a copy to the 
Administrative Agent) in the form of a Letter of Credit Application, 
appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of the 
Borrower. Such Letter of Credit Application must be received by the 
applicable Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 
a.m. at least two Business Days (or such later date and time as the 
Administrative Agent and the applicable Issuing Bank may agree in a 
particular instance in their sole discretion) prior to the proposed 
issuance date or date of amendment, as the case may be. In the case of a 
request for an initial issuance of a Letter of Credit, such Letter of 
Credit Application shall specify in form and detail satisfactory to the 
applicable Issuing Bank: (A) the proposed issuance date of the requested 
Letter of Credit (which shall be a Business Day); (B) the stated amount 
thereof; (C) the expiry date thereof (and any evergreen renewals, if any, 
including the terms thereof); (D) the name and address of the beneficiary 
thereof; (E) the documents to be presented by such beneficiary in case of 
any drawing thereunder; (F) the full text of any certificate to be 
presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; (G) the 
purpose and nature of the requested Letter of Credit; and (H) such other 
matters as such Issuing Bank may require. In the case of a request for an 
amendment of any outstanding Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit 
Application shall specify in form and detail satisfactory to the applicable 
Issuing Bank (w) the Letter of Credit to be amended; (x) the proposed date 
of amendment thereof (which shall be a Business Day); (y) the nature of the 
proposed amendment; and (z) such other matters as such Issuing Bank may 
require. Additionally, the Borrower shall furnish to the applicable Issuing 
Bank and the Administrative Agent such other documents and information 
pertaining to such requested Letter of Credit issuance or amendment, 
including any Issuer Documents, as such Issuing Bank or the Administrative 
Agent may require.

(ii) Promptly after receipt of any Letter of Credit Application, the 
applicable Issuing Bank will confirm with the Administrative Agent in 
writing (which may be by electronic mail or telecopy) that the 
Administrative Agent has received a copy of such Letter of Credit 
Application from the Borrower and, if not, such Issuing Bank will provide 
the Administrative Agent with a copy thereof. Unless the applicable Issuing 
Bank has received written notice from any Revolving Facility Lender, the 
Administrative Agent or any Loan Party, at least one Business Day prior to 
the requested date of issuance or amendment of the applicable Letter of 
Credit, that one or more applicable conditions contained in Article 4.01 
shall not then be satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions 
hereof, such applicable Issuing Bank shall, on the requested date, issue a 
Letter of Credit for the account of the Borrower or the applicable 
Subsidiary or enter into the applicable amendment, as the case may be, in 
each case in accordance with such Issuing Banks usual and customary 
business practices. Immediately upon the issuance
 
-58-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
of each Letter of Credit, each Revolving Facility Lender shall be deemed 
to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the 
applicable Issuing Bank a risk participation in such Letter of Credit in an 
amount equal to the product of such Revolving Facility Lenders Applicable 
Percentage times the amount of such Letter of Credit.

(iii) Promptly after its delivery of any Letter of Credit or any amendment 
to a Letter of Credit to an advising bank with respect thereto or to the 
beneficiary thereof, the applicable Issuing Bank will also deliver to the 
Borrower and the Administrative Agent a true and complete copy of such 
Letter of Credit or amendment.

(c) Drawings and Reimbursements; Funding of Participations. (i) Upon 
receipt from the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit of any notice of a 
drawing under such Letter of Credit, the applicable Issuing Bank shall 
notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent thereof. Not later than 
11:00 a.m. on the date of any payment by the applicable Issuing Bank under 
a Letter of Credit (each such date, an Honor Date), the Borrower shall 
reimburse the applicable Issuing Bank through the Administrative Agent in 
an amount equal to the amount of such drawing. If the Borrower fails to so 
reimburse the applicable Issuing Bank by such time, the Administrative 
Agent shall promptly notify each Revolving Facility Lender of the Honor 
Date, the amount of the unreimbursed drawing (the Unreimbursed Amount), 
and the amount of such Revolving Facility Lenders Applicable Percentage 
thereof. In such event, the Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a 
Borrowing of ABR Loans to be disbursed one Business Day after the Honor 
Date in an amount equal to the Unreimbursed Amount, without regard to the 
minimum and multiples specified in Section 2.02 for the principal amount of 
ABR Loans, but subject to the amount of the unutilized portion of the 
Commitments and the conditions set forth in Section 4.01 (other than the 
delivery of a Borrowing Request) (provided, however, that for the avoidance 
of doubt, no Revolving Facility lender shall be required to disburse their 
portion of the Unreimbursed Amount sooner than the time periods specified 
in Section 2.03).

(ii) Each Revolving Facility Lender shall upon any notice pursuant to 
Section 2.05(c)(i) make funds available (and the Administrative Agent may 
apply Cash Collateral provided for this purpose) for the account of the 
applicable Issuing Bank at the Administrative Agents Office in an amount 
equal to its Applicable Percentage of the Unreimbursed Amount not later 
than 1:00 p.m. on the Business Day specified in such notice by the 
Administrative Agent, whereupon, subject to the provisions of Section 
2.05(c)(iii), each Revolving Facility Lender that so makes funds available 
shall be deemed to have made an ABR Loan to the Borrower in such amount 
(provided, however, that for the avoidance of doubt, no Revolving Facility 
lender shall be required to disburse their portion of the Unreimbursed 
Amount sooner than the time periods specified in Section 2.03). The 
Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the applicable 
Issuing Bank.

(iii) With respect to any Unreimbursed Amount that is not fully refinanced 
by a Borrowing of ABR Loans because the conditions set forth in Section 
4.01 cannot be satisfied or for any other reason, the Borrower shall be 
deemed to have incurred from the applicable Issuing Bank an L/C Borrowing 
in the amount of the Unreimbursed Amount that is not so refinanced, which 
L/C Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand
 
-59-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(together with interest) and shall bear interest at the rate specified in 
Section 2.13. In such event, each Revolving Facility Lenders payment to 
the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank 
pursuant to Section 2.05(c)(ii) shall be deemed payment in respect of its 
participation in such L/C Borrowing and shall constitute an L/C Advance 
from such Revolving Facility Lender in satisfaction of its participation 
obligation under this Section 2.05.

(iv) Until each Revolving Facility Lender funds its Loan or L/C Advance 
pursuant to this Section 2.05(c) to reimburse applicable Issuing Bank for 
any amount drawn under any Letter of Credit, interest in respect of such 
Revolving Facility Lenders Applicable Percentage of such amount shall be 
solely for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank.

(v) Each Revolving Facility Lenders obligation to make Loans or L/C 
Advances to reimburse the applicable Issuing Bank for amounts drawn under 
Letters of Credit, as contemplated by this Section 2.05(c), shall be 
absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, 
including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right 
which such Revolving Facility Lender may have against the applicable 
Issuing Bank, the Borrower or any other person for any reason whatsoever; 
(B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, or (C) any other 
occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the 
foregoing; provided, however, that each Revolving Facility Lenders 
obligation to make Loans pursuant to this Section 2.05(c) is subject to the 
conditions set forth in Section 4.01 (other than delivery by the Borrower 
of a Borrowing Request). No such making of an L/C Advance shall relieve or 
otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrower to reimburse the applicable 
Issuing Bank for the amount of any payment made by the Issuing Bank under 
any Letter of Credit, together with interest as provided herein.

(vi) If any Revolving Facility Lender fails to make available to the 
Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank any 
amount required to be paid by such Revolving Facility Lender pursuant to 
the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.05(c) by the time specified in 
Section 2.05(c)(ii), then, without limiting the other provisions of this 
Agreement, the applicable Issuing Bank shall be entitled to recover from 
such Revolving Facility Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), 
on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date 
such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately 
available to the applicable Issuing Bank at a rate per annum equal to the 
greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the applicable 
Issuing Bank in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank 
compensation, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees 
customarily charged by the applicable Issuing Bank in connection with the 
foregoing. If such Revolving Facility Lender pays such amount (with 
interest and fees as aforesaid), the amount so paid shall constitute such 
Revolving Facility Lenders Loan included in the relevant Borrowing or L/C 
Advance in respect of the relevant L/C Borrowing, as the case may be. A 
certificate of the applicable Issuing Bank submitted to any Revolving 
Facility Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any 
amounts owing under this clause (vi) shall be conclusive absent manifest 
error.
 
-60-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(d) Repayment of Participations.

(i) At any time after the applicable Issuing Bank has made a payment under 
any Letter of Credit and has received from any Revolving Facility Lender 
such Revolving Facility Lenders L/C Advance in respect of such payment in 
accordance with Section 2.05(c), if the Administrative Agent receives for 
the account of the applicable Issuing Bank any payment in respect of the 
related Unreimbursed Amount or interest thereon (whether directly from the 
Borrower or otherwise, including proceeds of Cash Collateral applied 
thereto by the Administrative Agent), the Administrative Agent will 
distribute to such Revolving Facility Lender its Applicable Percentage 
thereof in the same funds as those received by the Administrative Agent.

(ii) If any payment received by the Administrative Agent for the account of 
any Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.05(c)(i) is required to be returned 
under any of the circumstances described in Section 9.07 (including 
pursuant to any settlement entered into by the applicable Issuing Bank in 
its discretion), each Revolving Facility Lender shall pay to the 
Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank its 
Applicable Percentage thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus 
interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is 
returned by such Revolving Facility Lender, at a rate per annum equal to 
the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect. The obligations of the 
Revolving Facility Lenders under this clause shall survive the payment in 
full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement.

(e) Obligations Absolute. The obligation of the Borrower to reimburse the 
Issuing Banks for each drawing under each Letter of Credit and to repay 
each L/C Borrowing shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and 
shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under 
all circumstances, including the following:

(i) any lack of validity or enforceability of such Letter of Credit, this 
Agreement, or any other Loan Document;

(ii) the existence of any claim, counterclaim, setoff, defense or other 
right that the Borrower or any Subsidiary may have at any time against any 
beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit (or any person for 
whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), the 
applicable Issuing Bank or any other person, whether in connection with 
this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or by such Letter of 
Credit or any agreement or instrument relating thereto, or any unrelated 
transaction;

(iii) any draft, demand, certificate or other document presented under such 
Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient 
in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any 
respect; or any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any 
document required in order to make a drawing under such Letter of Credit;
 
-61-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(iv) any payment by the applicable Issuing Bank under such Letter of Credit 
against presentation of a draft or certificate that does not strictly 
comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit; or any payment made by the 
applicable Issuing Bank under such Letter of Credit to any person 
purporting to be a trustee in bankruptcy, debtor-in-possession, assignee 
for the benefit of creditors, liquidator, receiver or other representative 
of or successor to any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of 
Credit, including any arising in connection with any proceeding under any 
Debtor Relief Law; or

(v) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar 
to any of the foregoing, including any other circumstance that might 
otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the 
Borrower or any Subsidiary.

The Borrower shall promptly examine a copy of each Letter of Credit and 
each amendment thereto that is delivered to it and, in the event of any 
claim of noncompliance with the Borrowers instructions or other 
irregularity, the Borrower will immediately notify the applicable Issuing 
Bank. The Borrower shall be conclusively deemed to have waived any such 
claim against the applicable Issuing Bank and its correspondents unless 
such notice is given as aforesaid.

(f) Role of the Issuing Banks. Each Revolving Facility Lender and the 
Borrower agree that, in paying any drawing under a Letter of Credit, no 
Issuing Bank shall have any responsibility to obtain any document (other 
than any sight draft, certificates and documents expressly required by the 
Letter of Credit) or to ascertain or inquire as to the validity or accuracy 
of any such document or the authority of the person executing or delivering 
any such document. Neither any Issuing Bank, the Administrative Agent, any 
of their respective Related Parties nor any correspondent, participant or 
assignee of any Issuing Bank shall be liable to any Lender for (i) any 
action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or with the 
approval of the Lenders or the Required Lenders, as applicable; (ii) any 
action taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful 
misconduct; or (iii) the due execution, effectiveness, validity or 
enforceability of any document or instrument related to any Letter of 
Credit or Issuer Document. The Borrower hereby assumes all risks of the 
acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use 
of any Letter of Credit; provided, however, that this assumption is not 
intended to, and shall not, preclude the Borrowers pursuing such rights 
and remedies as it may have against the beneficiary or transferee at law or 
under any other agreement. Neither any Issuing Bank, the Administrative 
Agent, any of their respective Related Parties nor any correspondent, 
participant or assignee of any Issuing Bank shall be liable or responsible 
for any of the matters described in clauses (i) through (v) of Section 
2.05(e); provided, however, that anything in such clauses to the contrary 
notwithstanding, the Borrower may have a claim against an Issuing Bank, and 
such Issuing Bank may be liable to the Borrower, to the extent, but only to 
the extent, of any direct, as opposed to consequential or exemplary, 
damages suffered by the Borrower which the Borrower proves were caused by 
such Issuing Banks willful misconduct or gross negligence or such Issuing 
Banks willful failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after the 
presentation to it by the beneficiary of a sight draft and certificate(s) 
strictly complying with the terms and conditions of a Letter of Credit. In 
furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, any Issuing Bank may 
accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without 
responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or 
information to the contrary, no Issuing Bank shall be responsible for the 
validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or 
purporting to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or 
benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may 
prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason.
 
-62-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(g) Unless otherwise expressly agreed by the applicable Issuing Bank and 
the Borrower when a Letter of Credit is issued, the rules of the ISP shall 
apply to each standby Letter of Credit.

(h) Certain Conditions. No Issuing Bank shall be under any obligation to 
issue any Letter of Credit if:

(i) any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority or 
arbitrator shall by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain the applicable 
Issuing Bank from issuing the Letter of Credit, or any Law applicable to 
the applicable Issuing Bank or any request or directive (whether or not 
having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction 
over the applicable Issuing Bank shall prohibit, or request that the 
applicable Issuing Bank refrain from, the issuance of letters of credit 
generally or the Letter of Credit in particular or shall impose upon the 
applicable Issuing Bank with respect to the Letter of Credit any 
restriction, reserve or capital requirement (for which the applicable 
Issuing Bank is not otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect on the 
Closing Date, or shall impose upon the applicable Issuing Bank any 
unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which was not applicable on the Closing 
Date and which the applicable Issuing Bank in good faith deems material to 
it;

(ii) the issuance of the Letter of Credit would violate one or more 
policies of the applicable Issuing Bank applicable to letters of credit 
generally;

(iii) the Letter of Credit is to be denominated in a currency other than 
Dollars; or

(iv) any Lender is at that time a Defaulting Lender, unless the applicable 
Issuing Bank has entered into arrangements, including the delivery of Cash 
Collateral, satisfactory to the applicable Issuing Bank (in its sole 
discretion) with the Borrower or such Lender to eliminate the Issuing 
Banks actual or potential Fronting Exposure (after giving effect to 
Section 2.23(a)(iv)) with respect to the Defaulting Lender arising from 
either the Letter of Credit then proposed to be issued or that Letter of 
Credit and all other Letter of Credit obligations as to which the 
applicable Issuing Bank has actual or potential Fronting Exposure, as it 
may elect in its sole discretion.

(i) Expiration Date. Each Letter of Credit shall expire at or prior to the 
close of business on the earlier of (i) the date one year after the date of 
the issuance of such Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any renewal or 
extension thereof, one year after such renewal or extension) and (ii) the 
date that is five Business Days prior to the Revolving Facility Maturity 
Date; provided, that any Letter of Credit with a one-year tenor may provide 
for the automatic renewal thereof for additional one-year periods (which, 
in no event, shall extend beyond the applicable date referred to in clause 
(a) of this Section 2.05).
 
-63-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(j) Replacement of an Issuing Bank. An Issuing Bank may be replaced at any 
time by written agreement among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the 
replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank. The Administrative 
Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of an Issuing Bank. 
At the time any such replacement shall become effective, the Borrower shall 
pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced Issuing Bank 
pursuant to Section 2.12(b). From and after the effective date of any such 
replacement, (i) the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and 
obligations of the replaced Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect 
to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii) references herein to 
the term Issuing Bank shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to 
any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all previous Issuing 
Banks, as the context shall require. After the replacement of an Issuing 
Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and 
shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of such Issuing Bank 
under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior 
to such replacement but shall not be required to issue additional Letters 
of Credit.

(k) Appointment of an Issuing Bank and Additional Issuing Banks. From time 
to time, HPS (in its sole discretion) may agree to act as an Issuing Bank 
pursuant to a written agreement among the Borrower, the Administrative 
Agent and HPS, provided that notwithstanding such written agreement or 
anything herein to contrary, if at any time HPS is unable or cannot act as 
an Issuing Bank without undue burden or without incurring incremental fees, 
costs or expenses of a non-de minimis nature then HPS may, upon written 
notice to the Borrower and Administrative Agent, immediately resign from 
its role as Issuing Bank. If at any time, and from time to time, HPS is 
required to cash collaterize any Letter of Credit issued by a Third Party 
LC Issuer, the Borrower agrees to immediately (with either cash on hand or 
via a request for a Revolving Facility Borrowing (with such requirement 
being satisfied if the Borrower immediately requests a Revolving Facility 
Borrowing and promptly applies the proceeds of such Revolving Facility 
Borrowing as set forth in this sentence)) cash collateralize such Letter of 
Credit (or reimburse HPS for such cash collateralization). From time to 
time, the Borrower may by written notice to the Administrative Agent 
designate up to four Lenders, each of which agrees (in its sole discretion) 
to act in such capacity and each of which is reasonably satisfactory to the 
Administrative Agent as an Issuing Bank. Each such additional Issuing Bank 
shall execute a counterpart of this Agreement upon the approval of the 
Administrative Agent (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) 
and shall thereafter be an Issuing Bank hereunder for all purposes. For 
avoidance of doubt, no Third Party LC Issuer shall be required to become a 
party to this Agreement.

(l) Issuing Bank Agreements. Unless otherwise requested by the 
Administrative Agent, each Issuing Bank shall report in writing to the 
Administrative Agent (i) on the first Business Day of each month, the daily 
activity (set forth by day) in respect of Letters of Credit during the 
immediately preceding month, including all issuances, extensions, 
amendments and renewals, all expirations and cancellations and all 
disbursements and reimbursements, (ii) on or prior to each Business Day on 
which such Issuing Bank expects to issue, amend, renew or extend any Letter 
of Credit, the date of such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension, and 
the aggregate face amount of the Letters of Credit to be issued, amended, 
renewed or extended by it and outstanding after giving effect to such 
issuance, amendment, renewal or extension occurred (and whether the amount 
thereof changed), it being understood that such Issuing Bank shall not 
permit any issuance, renewal, extension or amendment resulting in an 
increase in the amount of any Letter of Credit to occur without first 
obtaining written (or, with respect to any Issuing Bank, if the 
Administrative Agent so agrees
 
-64-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
with respect to such Issuing Bank, telephonic) confirmation from the 
Administrative Agent that it is then permitted under this Agreement, (iii) 
on each Business Day on which such Issuing Bank makes any L/C Disbursement 
in respect of any Letter of Credit issued, the date of such L/C 
Disbursement and the amount of such L/C Disbursement, (iv) on any Business 
Day on which the Borrower fails to reimburse an L/C Disbursement required 
to be reimbursed to such Issuing Bank on such day, the date of such failure 
and the amount of such L/C Disbursement and (v) on any other Business Day, 
such other information as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably 
request.

SECTION 2.06 Funding of Borrowings.

(a) Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it on the proposed date 
thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds by 12:00 noon, 
Local Time, to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently 
designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders; provided, that 
Swingline Loans shall be made as provided in Section 2.04. Upon receipt of 
all funds requested in the Borrowing Request, the Administrative Agent will 
make such Loans available to the Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts 
so received, in like funds, to an account of the Borrower designated by the 
Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request; provided, that L/C Advances 
made to finance a L/C Borrowing pursuant to Section 2.05(b)(ii) shall be 
remitted by the Administrative Agent to the applicable Issuing Bank.

(b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a 
Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing of Eurocurrency Loans 
(or, in the case of any Borrowing of ABR Loans, prior to 12:00 noon on the 
date of such Borrowing) that such Lender will not make available to the 
Administrative Agent such Lenders share of such Borrowing, the 
Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share 
available on such date and at the time required by Section 2.06(a) and may, 
in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a 
corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its 
share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, 
then the applicable Lender and the Borrower each severally agree to pay to 
the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in 
immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and 
including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but 
excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (A) in the 
case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of the Federal 
Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance 
with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any 
administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the 
Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing, and (B) in the case 
of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to 
ABR Loans. If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the 
Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the 
Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of 
such interest paid by the Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its 
share of the applicable Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the 
amount so paid shall constitute such Lenders Loan included in such 
Borrowing. Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any 
claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make 
such payment to the Administrative Agent.
 
-65-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 2.07 Interest Elections. (a) Each Borrowing initially shall be of 
the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of 
a Eurocurrency Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as 
specified in such Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the Borrower may elect to 
convert such Borrowing to a different Type or to continue such Borrowing 
and, in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods 
therefor, all as provided in this Section. The Borrower may elect different 
options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in 
which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders 
holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans resulting from 
an election made with respect to any such portion shall be considered a 
separate Borrowing. This Section shall not apply to Swingline Borrowings, 
which may not be converted or continued.

(b) To make an election pursuant to this Section, the Borrower shall notify 
the Administrative Agent of such election (as provided in Section 9.01) in 
writing (in a form as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request) 
(which may be by electronic mail or telecopy) , in the case of an election 
that would result in a Borrowing, by the time that a Borrowing Request 
would be required under Section 2.03 if the Borrower were requesting a 
Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on the 
effective date of such election. Notwithstanding any other provision of 
this Section, the Borrower shall not be permitted to (i) change the 
currency of any Borrowing, (ii) elect an Interest Period for Eurocurrency 
Loans that does not comply with Section 2.02(d) or (iii) convert any 
Borrowing to a Borrowing not available under the Class of Commitments 
pursuant to which such Borrowing was made.

(c) Each written Interest Election Request shall specify the following 
information in compliance with Section 2.02:

(i) the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if 
different options are being elected with respect to different portions 
thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing 
(in which case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) 
and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing);

(ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest 
Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;

(iii) whether the resulting outstanding credit extension is to be an ABR 
Borrowing or a Eurocurrency Borrowing; and

(iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurocurrency Borrowing, the Interest 
Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such election, which 
shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term Interest 
Period.

If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurocurrency Borrowing but 
does not specify an Interest Period, then the Borrower shall be deemed to 
have selected an Interest Period of one months duration.

(d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the 
Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender to which such Interest 
Election Request relates of the details thereof and of such Lenders 
portion of each resulting Borrowing.
 
-66-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(e) If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request 
with respect to a Eurocurrency Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest 
Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as 
provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be 
converted to an ABR Borrowing. Notwithstanding any contrary provision 
hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the 
Administrative Agent, at the written request (including a request through 
electronic means) of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Borrower, then, 
so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Borrowing 
of Loans, may be converted to or continued as a Eurocurrency Borrowing and 
(ii) unless repaid, each Eurocurrency Borrowing of Loans shall be converted 
to an ABR Borrowing of the applicable Class at the end of the Interest 
Period applicable thereto.

SECTION 2.08 Termination and Reduction of Commitments. (a)(i) Unless 
previously terminated, the Revolving Facility Commitment (x) on the day 
that is the twelve month anniversary of the Closing Date, shall be reduced 
to $80,000,000, ratably among the Revolving Facility Lenders in accordance 
with their respective Revolving Facility Commitments and (y) shall 
terminate on the Revolving Facility Maturity Date.

(ii) The Term Loan Commitments shall terminate on the Closing Date 
(immediately after the incurrence of Term Loans on such date).

(b) The Borrower may at any time terminate, or from time to time reduce, 
the Revolving Facility Commitments; provided, that (i) each reduction of 
the Commitments of any Class shall be in an amount that is an integral 
multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $5,000,000 (or, if less, the 
remaining amount of the Revolving Facility Commitments) and (ii) the 
Borrower shall not terminate or reduce the Revolving Facility Commitments 
if, after giving effect to any concurrent prepayment of the Revolving 
Facility Loans in accordance with Section 2.11, the total Revolving 
Facility Exposure plus the face amount of letters of credit issued under 
Section 6.01(s) would exceed the total Revolving Facility Commitments; 
provided further that, the Borrower may terminate the unused Revolving 
Facility Commitments of any Defaulting Lender at any time, or from time to 
time, in any amounts and without a pro rata reduction of the Revolving 
Facility Commitments of the other Lenders.

(c) The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent in writing (which 
may be by electronic mail or telecopy) of any election to terminate or 
reduce the Revolving Facility Commitments under paragraph (b) of this 
Section at least three Business Days prior to the effective date of such 
termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date 
thereof. Promptly following receipt of any notice, the Administrative Agent 
shall advise the applicable Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice 
delivered by the Borrower pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable; 
provided, that a notice of termination of the Revolving Facility 
Commitments delivered by the Borrower may state that such notice is 
conditioned upon the effectiveness of other financing, in which case such 
notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative 
Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not 
satisfied. Any termination or reduction of the Commitments of any Class 
pursuant to this Section 2.08 shall be permanent. Each reduction of the 
Commitments of any Class shall be made ratably among the Lenders in 
accordance with their respective Commitments of such Class.
 
-67-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 2.09 Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt. (a) The Borrower hereby 
unconditionally promises to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the 
account of each Revolving Facility Lender the then unpaid principal amount 
of each Revolving Facility Loan of such Lender to the Borrower on the 
Revolving Facility Maturity Date, (ii) to the Administrative Agent for the 
account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Term Loan 
of such Lender to the Borrower as provided in Section 2.10 and (iii) to the 
Swingline Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Swingline Loan to 
the Borrower on the Revolving Facility Maturity Date.

(b) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an 
account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such 
Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts 
of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time 
hereunder.

(c) The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall 
record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Class and Type 
thereof and the Interest Period (if any) applicable thereto, (ii) the 
amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and 
payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) any amount 
received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the 
Lenders and each Lenders share thereof.

(d) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraph (b) 
or (c) of this Section shall be prima facie evidence of the existence, 
currencies and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; provided, that 
the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such 
accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation 
of the Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this 
Agreement and in the event of any conflict between the entries made in the 
accounts maintained pursuant to Section 2.09(b) and the accounts maintained 
pursuant to Section 2.09(c), the accounts maintained pursuant to Section 
2.09(c) shall govern and control absent manifest error.

(e) Any Lender may request that Loans of any Class made by it be evidenced 
by a promissory note (a Note). In such event, the Borrower shall prepare, 
execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to such Lender 
and its registered assigns and in a form approved by the Administrative 
Agent and reasonably acceptable to the Borrower.

SECTION 2.10 Repayment of Term Loans and Revolving Facility Loans.

(a) Subject to the other paragraphs of this Section, the Borrower shall 
repay Term Loans prior to 2:00 p.m., Local Time, on each date set forth 
below in the aggregate principal amount set forth for such Borrowings 
opposite such date; provided that if such date does not fall on a Business 
Day, then such amounts shall be paid on the preceding Business Day:

To the extent not previously paid, outstanding Term Loans shall be due and

(i) shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment 
shall be the next preceding Business Day.

(b) To the extent not previously paid, outstanding Revolving Facility Loans 
shall be due and payable on the Revolving Facility Maturity Date.

(c) Subject to Section 2.23, prepayment of the Loans from:

(i) all Net Proceeds pursuant to Section 2.11(b) and Excess Cash Flow 
pursuant to Section 2.11(c) to be applied to prepay Term Loans shall be 
applied to reduce, in the inverse order of maturity, the unpaid scheduled 
amortization payments under paragraph (a)(i) above in respect of the Term 
Loans on a ratable basis (which shall include, for the avoidance of doubt, 
the Term Loan Maturity Date payment); and

(ii) any optional prepayments of the Term Loans pursuant to Section 2.11(a) 
shall be applied to reduce in the inverse order of maturity, the unpaid 
scheduled amortization payment under paragraph (a)(i) above in respect of 
the Term Loans on a ratable basis (which shall include, for the avoidance 
of doubt, the Term Loan Maturity Date payment).

(d) Prior to any repayment of any Loan or Loans hereunder, the Borrower 
shall select the Borrowing or Borrowings constituting such Loan or Loans to 
be repaid or reduced and shall notify the Administrative Agent in writing 
by electronic mail or telecopy) of such selection (i) in the case of an ABR 
Term Loan Borrowing, not later than 12:00 p.m., Local Time, one Business 
Day before the scheduled date of such repayment, (ii) in the case of a 
Eurocurrency Borrowing, not later than 12:00 p.m., Local Time, three

-69-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Borrowing, not later than 10:00 a.m. Local Time, one Business Day prior to 
the day of such repayment.    Except as otherwise provided in Section 
2.11(e), each repayment of a Borrowing within any Class shall be applied 
ratably to the Loans in such Class included in the repaid Borrowing. 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the immediately preceding 
sentence, the Borrower shall select the Borrowing or Borrowings to be 
repaid and shall notify the Administrative Agent in writing (by electronic 
mail or telecopy) of such selection not later than 12:00 p.m., Local Time, 
on the scheduled date of such repayment. Repayments of Borrowings shall be 
accompanied by accrued interest on the amount repaid and any fees required 
pursuant to Section 2.12(e) and reasonably documented out-of-pocket 
expenses with respect to such repayments to the extent required to be 
reimbursed pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. Notwithstanding 
anything herein to the contrary (but in any event subject to Section 2.16
), the Borrower may rescind any notice of prepayment pursuant to Section 
2.11(a), if such prepayment would have resulted from a refinancing or 
repayment of the facilities under this Agreement (whether through the 
incurrence of other Indebtedness, issuance of Equity Interests or 
otherwise), which refinancing or repayment shall not be consummated or 
shall otherwise be delayed, or condition such prepayment pursuant to 
Section 2.11(a) on the consummation of such refinancing or repayment. Any 
prepayments required to be made under Sections 2.11(b), (c) or (d) shall be 
accompanied by a written notice of such prepayment in accordance with the 
timing in this Section 2.10(d), and shall include the sub-section of 
Section 2.11 that such payment is being made pursuant to.

SECTION 2.11 Prepayment of Loans. (a) The Borrower shall have the right, in 
its sole discretion at any time and from time to time to prepay any 
Borrowing in whole or in part, in accordance with paragraphs (c) and (d) of 
Section 2.10, without premium or penalty (but subject to Section 2.16 and 
except for the Prepayment Fee payable pursuant to Sections 2.12 (e)), in an 
aggregate principal amount that is an integral multiple of the Borrowing 
Multiple and not less than the Borrowing Minimum or, if less, the amount 
outstanding, subject to prior written notice in accordance with Section 
2.10(d).

(b) All Net Proceeds shall be applied promptly after receipt thereof to 
prepay Term Loans in accordance with paragraphs (c) and (d) of Section 2.10
. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that any Net Proceeds are not 
reinvested by the Borrower within the 12 month period referred to in Net 
Proceeds, or, upon request by the Administrative Agent if an Event of 
Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Borrower shall 
immediately apply the Net Proceeds as set forth in paragraphs (c) and (d) 
of Section 2.10.

(c) Not later than 90 days after the end of each Excess Cash Flow Period 
(or such later date, if any, on which the Borrower is permitted or required 
to deliver annual audited statements under Section 5.04(a)), commencing 
with the Excess Cash Flow Period ending on December 31, 2017, the Borrower 
shall prepay the Term Loans as set forth in paragraphs (c) and (d) of 
Section 2.10 in an aggregate amount equal to the (A) the Required 
Percentage of such Excess Cash Flow, if any, for such Excess Cash Flow 
Period, minus (B) the sum of (1) the aggregate principal amount of 
voluntary prepayments of Term Loans pursuant to Section 2.11(a), (2) 
permanent voluntary reductions of Revolving Facility Commitments pursuant 
to Section 2.08(b) solely to the extent that an equal amount of Revolving 
Facility Loans was simultaneously repaid pursuant to Section 2.11(a) (and 
solely to the extent any such voluntary prepayments of Term Loans and 
permanent reductions of Revolving Facility Commitments shall
 
-70-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
not have already been deducted when calculating Excess Cash Flow) and (3) 
the aggregate amount of Net Proceeds applied to repay the Term Loans 
pursuant to Section 2.11(b) in respect of clause (c) of the definition of 
Net Proceeds in such Excess Cash Flow Period; provided, that if the 
amount in clause (B) exceeds the amount in clause (A), no such prepayment 
of Term Loans shall be required. Not later than the date on which the 
Borrower is required to deliver financial statements with respect to the 
end of each Excess Cash Flow Period under Section 5.04(a), the Borrower 
will deliver to the Administrative Agent a certificate signed by a 
Responsible Officer of the Borrower setting forth the amount, if any, of 
Excess Cash Flow for such fiscal year, the amount of any required 
prepayment and the calculation thereof in reasonable detail.

(d) In the event and on such occasion that the total Revolving Facility 
Exposure plus the face amount of letters of credit issued under Section 
6.01(s) exceeds the total Revolving Facility Commitments, the Borrower 
shall prepay Revolving Facility Borrowings or Swingline Borrowings (or, if 
no such Borrowings are outstanding, deposit Cash Collateral in an account 
with the Collateral Agent pursuant to Section 2.22) in an aggregate amount 
equal to such excess.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 2.11 
or any other provision of this Agreement, the Borrower may prepay any Class 
or Classes of outstanding Term Loans, at a discount to par pursuant to one 
or more auctions (each, an Auction) on the following basis (any such 
prepayment, an Auction Prepayment):

(i) [Reserved].

(ii) All Term Lenders (other than Defaulting Lenders) of the applicable 
Class or Classes shall be permitted (but not required) to participate in 
each Auction. Any such Lender who elects to participate in an Auction may 
choose to offer all or part of such Lenders Term Loans of the applicable 
Class for prepayment.

(iii) Each Auction Prepayment shall be subject to the conditions that (A) 
the Administrative Agent shall have received a certificate to the effect 
that (I) immediately prior to and after giving effect to the Auction 
Prepayment, no Default shall have occurred and be continuing, (II) as of 
the date of the Auction Notice (as defined in Exhibit F), the Borrower is 
not in possession of any material non-public information with respect to 
Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries that has not been disclosed to the 
Lenders (other than Lenders that do not wish to receive material 
non-public information with respect to Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries) 
prior to such date, and, if not disclosed to the Lenders, could reasonably 
be expected to have a material effect upon, or otherwise be material to, 
(1) a Lenders decision to participate in any Auction or (2) the market 
price of the Term Loans subject to such Auction, and (III) each of the 
conditions to such Auction Prepayment has been satisfied, (B) immediately 
prior to and after giving effect to the Auction Prepayment, the sum of the 
unused Revolving Facility Commitments plus Unrestricted Cash and cash 
equivalents held by Loan Parties shall not be less than $75,000,000, (C) 
each offer of prepayment made pursuant to this Section 2.11(e) must be in 
an amount not less than $5,000,000, (D) no Auction Prepayment shall be made 
from the proceeds of any Revolving Facility Loan or Swingline Loan, and (E) 
any Auction Prepayment shall be offered to all Lenders with Term Loans on a 
pro rata basis.
 
-71-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(iv) All Term Loans prepaid by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 
2.11(e) shall be accompanied by all accrued interest on the par principal 
amount so prepaid to, but not including, the date of the Auction 
Prepayment. Auction Prepayments shall not be subject to Section 2.16. The 
par principal amount of Term Loans prepaid pursuant to this Section 2.11(e) 
shall be applied pro rata to reduce the remaining scheduled installments of 
principal thereof pursuant to Section 2.10(c)(i).

(v) Each Auction shall comply with the Auction Procedures and any such 
other procedures established by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable 
discretion and agreed to by the Borrower.

(vi) This Section 2.11(e) shall neither (A) require the Borrower to 
undertake any Auction nor (B) limit or restrict the Borrower from making 
voluntary prepayments of Term Loans in accordance with Section 2.11(a).

SECTION 2.12 Fees. (a) The Borrower agrees to pay to each Revolving 
Facility Lender (other than any Defaulting Lender), through the 
Administrative Agent, three Business Days after the last day of March, 
June, September and December in each year, and three Business Days after 
the date on which the Revolving Facility Commitments of all the Revolving 
Facility Lenders shall be terminated as provided herein (which, if said day 
is not a Business Day, then the next Business Day thereafter), a commitment 
fee (a Commitment Fee) on the daily amount of the Available Unused 
Commitment of such Revolving Facility Lender during the preceding quarter 
(or shorter period commencing with the Closing Date or ending with the date 
on which the last of the Revolving Facility Commitments of such Lender 
shall be terminated), which shall accrue at a rate equal to the Applicable 
Margin. All Commitment Fees shall be computed on the basis of the actual 
number of days elapsed in a year of 360 days. For the purpose of 
calculating any Lenders Commitment Fee, the outstanding Swingline Loans 
during the period for which such Lenders Commitment Fee is calculated 
shall be deemed to be zero. The Commitment Fee due to each Revolving 
Facility Lender shall commence to accrue on the Closing Date and shall 
cease to accrue on the date on which the last of the Revolving Facility 
Commitments of such Lender shall be terminated as provided herein.

(b) The Borrower from time to time agrees to pay (i) to each Revolving 
Facility Lender, through the Administrative Agent, three Business Days 
after the last day of March, June, September and December of each year and 
three Business Days after the date on which the Revolving Facility 
Commitments of all the Lenders shall be terminated as provided herein, a 
fee (an L/C Participation Fee) on such Lenders Applicable Percentage of 
the daily aggregate L/C Exposure (excluding the portion thereof 
attributable to unreimbursed L/C Disbursements), during the preceding 
quarter (or shorter period commencing with the Closing Date or ending with 
the Revolving Facility Maturity Date or the date on which the Revolving 
Facility Commitments shall be terminated) at the rate per annum equal to 
the Applicable Margin for Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowings effective for 
each day in such period; provided, however, that any L/C Participation Fee 
otherwise payable for the account of a Defaulting Lender with respect to 
any Letter of Credit as to which such Defaulting Lender has not provided 
Cash Collateral satisfactory to the Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.22 
shall be payable, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, to the 
other Lenders in accordance with the upward adjustments in their respective 
Applicable Percentages allocable to such Letter of Credit
 
-72-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
pursuant to Section 2.23(a)(iv), with the balance of such fee, if any, 
payable to the Issuing Bank for its own account, and (ii) to each Issuing 
Bank, for its own account, (x) three Business Days after the last day of 
March, June, September and December of each year and three Business Days 
after the date on which the Revolving Facility Commitments of all the 
Lenders shall be terminated as provided herein, a fronting fee in respect 
of each Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank for the period from 
and including the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit to and 
including the termination of such Letter of Credit, computed at a rate to 
be agreed between the Issuing Bank and the Borrower per annum of the daily 
average stated amount of such Letter of Credit (or as otherwise agreed with 
such Issuing Bank), plus (y) in connection with the issuance, amendment or 
transfer of any such Letter of Credit or any L/C Disbursement thereunder, 
such Issuing Banks customary documentary and processing charges 
(collectively, Issuing Bank Fees). All L/C Participation Fees and Issuing 
Bank Fees that are payable on a per annum basis shall be computed on the 
basis of the actual number of days elapsed in a year of 360 days.

(c) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account 
of the Administrative Agent, the fees set forth in the Agent Fee Letter 
(the Administrative Agent Fees).

(d) [reserved].

(e) If (x) the Borrower makes a voluntary prepayment of all or any portion 
of Term Loans pursuant to Section 2.11(a) or a mandatory prepayment of all 
or any portion of Term Loans pursuant to Section 2.11(b) from the receipt 
of Net Proceeds pursuant to clause (b) of the definition thereof, (y) any 
Prepayment Transaction is consummated in respect of all or any portion of 
the Term Loans (including an assignment of all or any portion of a Term 
Loan held by a Non-Consenting Lender pursuant to Section 2.19(c)) or (z) 
the Term Loans become due as a result of an acceleration of the Term Loans 
pursuant to Section 7.01 (collectively, the Payment Events and each , a 
Payment Event), the Borrower shall pay each Lender whose Term Loans are 
subject to such Payment Event, on the date of such Payment Event, a fee 
(the Prepayment Fee), equal to: (i) if such Payment Event occurs on or 
prior to the second anniversary of the Closing Date, the Make Whole Premium 
Amount applicable to the aggregate principal amount of Term Loans subject 
to such Payment Event, (ii) if such Payment Event occurs after the second 
anniversary of the Closing Date but on or prior to the third anniversary of 
the Closing Date, 3.00% on the aggregate principal amount of Term Loans 
subject to such Payment Event and (iii) if such Payment Event occurs after 
the third anniversary of the Closing Date but on or prior to the fourth 
anniversary of the Closing Date, 1.00% on the aggregate principal amount of 
Term Loans subject to such Payment Event; provided that with respect to any 
Payment Event in respect of an acceleration in regard to Section 7.01(g) 
or prepayment in connection with a Change in Control (a COC Payment Event
), the Prepayment Fee that the Borrower shall pay each Lender whose Term 
Loans are subject to such COC Payment Event, payable on the date of such 
COC Payment Event, shall be equal to: (i) if such COC Payment Event occurs 
on or prior to the first anniversary of the Closing Date, the COC Make 
Whole Premium Amount applicable to the aggregate principal amount of Term 
Loans subject to such COC Payment Event, (ii) if such COC Payment Event 
occurs after the first anniversary of the Closing Date but on or prior to 
the
 
-73-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
second anniversary of the Closing Date, 3.00% on the aggregate principal 
amount of Term Loans subject to such COC Payment Event and (iii) if such 
COC Payment Event occurs after the second anniversary of the Closing Date 
but on or prior to the third anniversary of the Closing Date, 1.00% on the 
aggregate principal amount of Term Loans subject to such COC Payment Event; 
provided, however that for the avoidance of doubt, no Prepayment Fee shall 
be due with respect to any prepayments made pursuant to Section 2.11(b) 
from the receipt of Net Proceeds pursuant to clauses (a) and (c) of the 
definition thereof and Section 2.11(c).

(f) All Fees shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately available 
funds, to the Administrative Agent for distribution, if and as appropriate, 
among the applicable Lenders, except that Issuing Bank Fees shall be paid 
directly to the applicable Issuing Banks. Once paid, none of the Fees shall 
be refundable under any circumstances.

SECTION 2.13 Interest. (a) The Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing 
(including each Swingline Loan) shall bear interest at the ABR plus the 
Applicable Margin.

(b) The Loans comprising each Eurocurrency Borrowing shall bear interest at 
the Adjusted Eurocurrency Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such 
Borrowing plus the Applicable Margin.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest on any 
Loan or any Fees or other amount payable by the Borrower hereunder is not 
paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, 
then (i) such overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before 
judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (A) in the case of overdue principal 
of any Loan, 2.00% plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as 
provided in the preceding paragraphs of this Section or (B) in the case of 
any other amount, 2.00% plus the interest rate that would have applied had 
such amount, during the period of non-payment, constituted an ABR Loan, and 
(ii) all other principal of any Loan then outstanding hereunder shall bear 
interest at a rate of 2.00% plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan 
as provided in the preceding paragraphs of this Section 2.13; provided, 
that this paragraph (c) shall not apply to any Event of Default that has 
been waived by the Lenders pursuant to Section 9.09.

(d) Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears (i) on each 
Interest Payment Date for such Loan, (ii) in the case of Revolving Facility 
Loans, upon the earlier of the termination of the Revolving Facility 
Commitments and the Revolving Facility Maturity Date and (iii) in the case 
of the Term Loans, on the Term Loan Maturity Date; provided, that (A) 
interest accrued pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section shall be payable 
on demand, (B) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan 
(other than a prepayment of an ABR Revolving Loan prior to the end of the 
Revolving Availability Period), accrued interest on the principal amount 
repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or 
prepayment, and (C) in the event of any conversion of any Eurocurrency Loan 
prior to the end of the current Interest Period therefor, accrued interest 
on such Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion.

(e) All computations of interest for ABR Loans determined by reference to 
the Prime Rate shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, 
as the case may be, and actual days elapsed. All other computations of fees 
and interest shall be made on the basis of a 360-day year and actual days 
elapsed (which results in more fees or interest, as applicable, being paid 
than if computed on the basis of a 365-day year). Interest shall accrue on 
each Loan for the day on which the Loan is made, and shall not accrue on a 
Loan, or any portion thereof,
 
-74-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
for the day on which the Loan or such portion is paid, provided that any 
Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made shall, subject to 
Section 2.18(a), bear interest for one day. Each determination by the 
Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be 
conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

(f) When entering into this Agreement, the parties have assumed that the 
interest payable at the rates set out in this Section 2.13 (Interest) or in 
other Sections of this Agreement is not and will not become subject to 
Swiss withholding tax (Verrechnungssteuer). Notwithstanding that the 
parties do not anticipate (acting in good faith) that any payment of 
interest will be subject to Swiss withholding tax (Verrechnungssteuer), 
they agree that, if a tax deduction for Swiss withholding tax (
Verrechnungssteuer) is required by law to be made by a Loan Party in 
respect of any interest payable by it under this Agreement and should, in 
respect of such Loan Party, paragraph (b) of Section 2.17 (Payments free of 
Taxes) or paragraph (d) of Section 2.17 (Indemnification by Borrower) be 
unenforceable for any reason, the applicable interest rate in relation to 
that interest payment shall be

(i) the interest rate which would have applied to that interest payment (as 
provided for in this Section 2.13 (Interest) or otherwise in this Agreement 
in the absence of this paragraph (g))

divided by

(ii) 1 minus the rate at which the relevant Tax Deduction is required to be 
made (where the rate at which the relevant deduction or withholding of Tax 
is required to be made is for this purpose expressed as a fraction of 1 
rather than as a percentage) and

(1) the relevant Loan Party shall be obliged to pay the relevant interest 
at the adjusted rate in accordance with this paragraph, (2) the relevant 
Loan Party shall make the tax deduction for Swiss withholding tax (
Verrechnungssteuer) on the so recalculated interest and (3) all references 
to a rate of interest in this Agreement shall be construed accordingly..

(g) To the extent that interest payable by a Loan Party under this 
Agreement becomes subject to Swiss withholding tax (Verrechnungssteuer), 
each relevant Lender and the Loan Parties shall promptly co-operate in 
completing any procedural formalities (including submitting forms and 
documents required by the appropriate Tax authority) to the extent possible 
and necessary for the relevant Loan Party to obtain authorization to make 
interest payments without them being subject to Swiss withholding tax (
Verrechnungssteuer) or to allow the Lenders to prepare claims for the 
refund of any Swiss withholding tax (Verrechnungssteuer) so deducted.

SECTION 2.14 Alternate Rate of Interest. If prior to the commencement of 
any Interest Period for a Eurocurrency Borrowing denominated in any 
currency, on any day:
 
-75-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(a) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be 
conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not 
exist for ascertaining any applicable Adjusted Eurocurrency Rate for such 
currency for such Interest Period for such day; or

(b) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that any 
applicable Adjusted Eurocurrency Rate for such currency for such Interest 
Period for such day will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such 
Lenders of making or maintaining their Loans included in such Borrowing, 
for such Interest Period or such day;

then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and 
the Lenders by electronic mail or telecopy as promptly as practicable 
thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and 
the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer 
exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of 
any Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing as, a Eurocurrency 
Borrowing denominated in such currency shall be ineffective and such 
Borrowing shall be converted to or continued as on the last day of the 
Interest Period applicable thereto, an ABR Borrowing and (ii) if any 
Borrowing Request requests a Eurocurrency Borrowing in such currency, such 
Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing.

SECTION 2.15 Increased Costs. (a) If any Change in Law shall:

(i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit 
compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, 
deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in 
by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the 
Adjusted Eurocurrency Rate) or any Issuing Bank;

(ii) subject any Recipient to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, 
(B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of 
Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan 
principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its 
deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; or

(iii) impose on any Lender or Issuing Bank or the London interbank market 
any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or 
Eurocurrency Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or 
participation therein;

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to 
such Lender of making or maintaining any Eurocurrency Loan (or of 
maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost 
to such Lender or Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or maintaining 
any Letter of Credit or to reduce the amount of any sum received or 
receivable by such Lender or Issuing Bank hereunder (whether of principal, 
interest or otherwise), then the Borrower will pay to such Lender or 
Issuing Bank, as applicable, such additional amount or amounts as will 
compensate such Lender or Issuing Bank, as applicable, for such additional 
costs incurred or reduction suffered.
 
-76-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(b) If any Lender or Issuing Bank determines that any Change in Law 
regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the 
rate of return on such Lenders or Issuing Banks capital or on the capital 
of such Lenders or Issuing Banks holding company, if any, as a 
consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in 
Letters of Credit or Swingline Loans held by, such Lender, or the Letters 
of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank, to a level below that which such 
Lender or such Issuing Bank or such Lenders or such Issuing Banks holding 
company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into 
consideration such Lenders or such Issuing Banks policies and the 
policies of such Lenders or such Issuing Banks holding company with 
respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower shall pay 
to such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as applicable, such additional amount 
or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such 
Lenders or such Issuing Banks holding company for any such reduction 
suffered.

(c) A certificate of a Lender or an Issuing Bank setting forth the amount 
or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or Issuing Bank or its 
holding company, as applicable, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of 
this Section shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive 
absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender or Issuing Bank, 
as applicable, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 
days after receipt thereof.

(d) Promptly after any Lender or any Issuing Bank has determined that it 
will make a request for increased compensation pursuant to this Section 
2.15, such Lender or Issuing Bank shall notify the Borrower thereof. 
Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or Issuing Bank to demand 
compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such 
Lenders or Issuing Banks right to demand such compensation; provided, 
that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or an 
Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions 
incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender or Issuing 
Bank, as applicable, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise 
to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lenders or Issuing 
Banks intention to claim compensation therefor; provided, further, that if 
the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is 
retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to 
include the period of retroactive effect thereof.

SECTION 2.16 Break Funding Payments. In the event of (a) the payment of any 
principal of any Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last day of an 
Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of 
Default), (b) the conversion of any Eurocurrency Loan other than on the 
last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to 
borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Eurocurrency Loan on the date 
specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto or (d) the assignment of 
any Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period 
applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to 
Section 2.19, then, in any such event, the Borrower shall compensate each 
Lender for the loss, cost and expense attributable to such event. In the 
case of a Eurocurrency Loan, such loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall 
be deemed to be the amount determined by such Lender to be the excess, if 
any, of (i) the amount of interest that would have accrued on the principal 
amount of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the Adjusted 
Eurocurrency Rate that would have been applicable to such Loan, for the 
period from the date of such event to the last day of the then current 
Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert 
or continue a Eurocurrency Loan, for the period that would have been the 
Interest Period for such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest that would 
accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate that 
such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period,
 
-77-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
for deposits in the applicable currency of a comparable amount and period 
from other banks in the Eurocurrency market. A certificate of any Lender 
setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive 
pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be 
conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the 
amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt 
thereof.]

SECTION 2.17 Taxes.

(a) Defined Terms. For purposes of this Section 2.17, the term Lender 
includes any Issuing Bank and the term applicable law includes FATCA.

(b) Payments Free of Taxes. Any and all payments by or on account of any 
obligation of the Borrower or any Loan Party under any Loan Document shall 
be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required 
by applicable law. If any applicable law (as determined in the good faith 
discretion of an applicable Withholding Agent) requires the deduction or 
withholding of any Tax from any such payment by a Withholding Agent, then 
the applicable Withholding Agent shall be entitled to make such deduction 
or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to 
the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law and, 
if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the Borrower or 
the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after 
such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and 
withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the 
applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have 
received had no such deduction or withholding been made.

(c) Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower. The Loan Parties shall timely 
pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable 
law, or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for 
the payment of, any Other Taxes.

(d) Indemnification by the Borrower. The Loan Parties shall jointly and 
severally indemnify each Recipient, within 10 days after demand therefor, 
for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes 
imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this 
Section) payable or paid by such Recipient or required to be withheld or 
deducted from a payment to such Recipient and any reasonable expenses 
arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified 
Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant 
Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or 
liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the 
Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or 
on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

(e) Evidence of Payments. As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes 
by any Loan Party to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this Section 2.17
, such Loan Party shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or 
a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority 
evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or 
other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the 
Administrative Agent.

(f) Indemnification by the Lenders. Each Lender shall severally indemnify 
the Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for (i) any 
Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that 
the Borrower or any Loan Party has not
 
-78-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and 
without limiting the obligation of the Loan Parties to do so), (ii) any 
Taxes attributable to such Lenders failure to comply with the provisions 
of Section 9.04(c) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register 
and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, 
that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any 
Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with 
respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally 
imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate 
as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by 
the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each 
Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any 
and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or 
otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other 
source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this 
paragraph (e).

(g) Status of Lenders.

(i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of 
withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall 
deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times 
reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such 
properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the 
Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be 
made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, 
any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative 
Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law 
or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will 
enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not 
such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting 
requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two 
sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation 
(other than such documentation set forth in Section 2.17(g) (ii)(A), 
(ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lenders 
reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject 
such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would 
materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.

(ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that 
the Borrower is a U.S. Borrower,

(A) any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the 
Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a 
Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the 
reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed 
copies of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. 
federal backup withholding tax;

(B) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do 
so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of 
copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on 
which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from 
time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the 
Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:
 
-79-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax 
treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments 
of interest under any Loan Document, executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or 
W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal 
withholding Tax pursuant to the interest article of such tax treaty and 
(y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, 
IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction 
of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the business profits or 
other income article of such tax treaty;

(2) executed copies of IRS Form W-8ECI;

(3) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption 
for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate 
substantially in the form of Exhibit G-1 to the effect that such Foreign 
Lender is not a bank within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the 
Code, a 10 percent shareholder of the Borrower within the meaning of 
Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a controlled foreign corporation 
described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a U.S. Tax Compliance 
Certificate) and (y) executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E; or

(4) to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed 
copies of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN 
or W-8BEN-E, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of 
Exhibit G-2 or Exhibit G-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification 
documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the 
Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners 
of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such 
Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially 
in the form of Exhibit G-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect 
partner;

(C) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do 
so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of 
copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on 
which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from 
time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the 
Administrative Agent), executed copies of any other form prescribed by 
applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in 
U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such 
supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to 
permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the 
withholding or deduction required to be made; and
 
-80-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(D) if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject 
to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to 
fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA 
(including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as 
applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the 
Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such 
time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative 
Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as 
prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional 
documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative 
Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to 
comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender 
has complied with such Lenders obligations under FATCA or to determine the 
amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of 
this clause (D), FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after 
the date of this Agreement.

Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously 
delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it 
shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and 
the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.

(h) Treatment of Certain Refunds. If any party determines, in its sole 
discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any 
Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section 2.17 
(including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section 
2.17), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such 
refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this 
Section with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all 
out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such indemnified party and 
without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental 
Authority with respect to such refund). Such indemnifying party, upon the 
request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party 
the amount paid over pursuant to this paragraph (h) (plus any penalties, 
interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) 
in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund 
to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in 
this paragraph (h), in no event will the indemnified party be required to 
pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this paragraph (h) the 
payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net 
after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax 
subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been 
deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or 
additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This 
paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make 
available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes 
that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.

(i) Survival. Each partys obligations under this Section 2.17 shall 
survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any 
assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination 
of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all 
obligations under any Loan Document
 
-81-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 2.18 Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs. 
(a) Unless otherwise specified, the Borrower shall make each payment 
required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees 
or reimbursement of L/C Disbursements, or of amounts payable under Section 
2.15, 2.16 or 2.17, or otherwise) prior to 2:00 p.m., Local Time, on the 
date when due, in immediately available funds, without condition or 
deduction for any defense, recoupment, set-off or counterclaim. Any amounts 
received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the 
Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next 
succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All 
such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent to the applicable 
account designated to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent, except 
payments to be made directly to the applicable Issuing Bank or the 
Swingline Lender as expressly provided herein and except that payments 
pursuant to Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.05 shall be made directly to 
the persons entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any 
such payments received by it for the account of any other person to the 
appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. Unless otherwise 
specified, if any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a 
Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding 
Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest 
thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments 
under each Loan Document of principal or interest in respect of any Loan 
(or of any breakage indemnity in respect of any Loan) shall be made in the 
currency of such Loan; all other payments hereunder and under each other 
Loan Document shall be made in U.S. Dollars, except as otherwise expressly 
provided herein. Any payment required to be made by the Administrative 
Agent hereunder shall be deemed to have been made by the time required if 
the Administrative Agent shall, at or before such time, have taken the 
necessary steps to make such payment in accordance with the regulations or 
operating procedures of the clearing or settlement system used by the 
Administrative Agent to make such payment.

(b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the 
Administrative Agent from the Borrower to pay fully all amounts of 
principal, unreimbursed L/C Disbursements, interest and fees then due from 
the Borrower hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards 
payment of interest and fees then due from the Borrower hereunder, ratably 
among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of 
interest and fees then due to such parties, (ii) second, towards payment of 
principal of Swingline Loans and unreimbursed L/C Disbursements then due 
from the Borrower hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in 
accordance with the amounts of principal, and unreimbursed L/C 
Disbursements then due to such parties, and (iii) third, towards payment of 
principal then due from the Borrower hereunder, ratably among the parties 
entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal then due to 
such parties.

(c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim 
or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on 
any of its Term Loans of a given Tranche, Revolving Facility Loans or 
participations in L/C Disbursements or Swingline Loans resulting in such 
Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of 
its Term Loans, Revolving Facility Loans and participations in L/C 
Disbursements and Swingline Loans and accrued interest thereon under any 
Tranche than the proportion received by any other Lender under such 
Tranche, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase 
(for cash at face value) participations in the Term Loans, Revolving 
Facility Loans and participations in L/C Disbursements and Swingline Loans 
of other Lenders under such Tranche to the extent necessary so that the 
benefit of all such payments shall be
 
-82-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
shared by the Lenders under such Tranche ratably in accordance with the 
aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective 
Term Loans, Revolving Facility Loans and participations in L/C 
Disbursements and Swingline Loans under such Tranche; provided, that (i) if 
any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment 
giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded 
and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without 
interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph (c) shall not be 
construed to apply to (x) any payment made pursuant to and in accordance 
with the express terms of this Agreement (including, without limitation, 
Section 2.11(e) or the application of funds arising from the existence of a 
Defaulting Lender), (y) the application of Cash Collateral provided for in 
Section 2.22, or (z) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for 
the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or 
subparticipations in L/C Disbursements or Swingline Loans to any assignee 
or participant. The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the 
extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender 
acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may 
exercise against the Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with 
respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct 
creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.

(d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the 
Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the 
Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the applicable 
Issuing Bank hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the 
Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on 
such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, 
distribute to the Lenders or the applicable Issuing Bank, as applicable, 
the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such 
payment, then each of the Lenders or the applicable Issuing Bank, as 
applicable, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith 
on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Bank with 
interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is 
distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the 
Administrative Agent, at the greater of (A) (1) in the case of Loans, the 
Federal Funds Effective Rate, (2) in the case of any other amounts 
denominated in U.S. Dollars, the Federal Funds Effective Rate, and (3) in 
the case of any other amount denominated in a currency other than U.S. 
Dollars, the rate reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent to be 
the cost to it of funding such amount, and (B) a rate determined by the 
Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank 
compensation.

(e) If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for any 
Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of 
this Article II, and such funds are not made available to the Borrower by 
the Administrative Agent because the applicable conditions set forth in 
Article IV are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, 
the Administrative Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as received 
from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest.

(f) The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Loans, to fund 
participations in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans and to make 
payments pursuant to Section 9.05(d) are several and not joint. The failure 
of any Lender to make any Loan, to fund any such participation or to make 
any payment under Section 9.05(d) on any date required hereunder shall not 
relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such 
date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other 
Lender to so make its Loan, to purchase its participation or to make its 
payment under Section 9.05(d).
 
-83-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 2.19 Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders. (a) If any 
Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if the Borrower is 
required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental 
Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, then such 
Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office 
for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and 
obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or Affiliates, 
if, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, such designation or 
assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to 
Section 2.15 or 2.17, as applicable, in the future and (ii) would not 
subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense and would 
not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender in any material respect. 
The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses 
incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or 
assignment.

(b) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if the 
Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any 
Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 
2.17, or is a Defaulting Lender, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense 
and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, 
require any such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in 
accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04
), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an 
assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another 
Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided, that (i) the 
Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the 
Administrative Agent (and, if in respect of any Revolving Facility 
Commitment or Revolving Facility Loan, the Swingline Lender and the Issuing 
Bank), which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender 
shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal 
of its Loans and participations in L/C Disbursements and Swingline Loans, 
accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it 
hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal 
and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other 
amounts) (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim 
for compensation under Section 2.15 or payments required to be made 
pursuant to Section 2.17, such assignment will result in a reduction in 
such compensation or payments, (iv) the Borrower shall have paid to the 
Administrative Agent the assignment fee specified in Section 9.05, and (v) 
such assignment does not conflict with any applicable Laws. A Lender shall 
not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior 
thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the 
circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment cease to 
apply. Nothing in this Section 2.19 shall be deemed to prejudice any rights 
that the Borrower may have against any Lender that is a Defaulting Lender.

(c) If any Lender has failed to consent to a proposed amendment, waiver, 
discharge or termination that pursuant to the terms of Section 9.09 
requires the consent of all the Lenders affected or each Lender and with 
respect to which the Required Lenders (as may be required by Section 9.09 
in any given case) shall have granted their consent (any such Lender 
referred to above, a Non-Consenting Lender), then so long as no Event of 
Default then exists, the Borrower shall have the right (unless such 
Non-Consenting Lender grants such consent) to (i) replace any such 
Non-Consenting Lender by requiring such Non-Consenting Lender to assign its
 
-84-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Loans and Commitments hereunder to one or more assignees reasonably 
acceptable to the Administrative Agent (and, if in respect of any Revolving 
Facility Commitment or Revolving Facility Loan, the Swingline Lender and 
the Issuing Bank) or (ii) require such Non-Consenting Lender to assign all 
of its Term Loans hereunder or all of its Revolving Facility Commitments or 
Revolving Facility Loans hereunder to one or more assignees reasonably 
acceptable to the Administrative Agent (and, if in respect of any Revolving 
Facility Commitment or Revolving Facility Loan, the Swingline Lender and 
the Issuing Bank); provided, that (i) all Obligations of the Borrower owing 
to such Non-Consenting Lender being replaced, including obligations arising 
under Section 2.16 as a result of such replacement, and/or all Obligations 
of the Borrower owing to such Non-Consenting Lender in respect of any Loans 
required to be assigned shall be paid in full to such Non-Consenting 
Lender concurrently with such assignment (including all fees payable to 
such Non-Consenting Lender in accordance with Sections 2.12(d) and (e)), 
and (ii) the replacement Lender shall purchase the foregoing by paying to 
such Non-Consenting Lender a price equal to the principal amount thereof 
plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon. In connection with any such 
assignment the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, such Non-Consenting 
Lender and the replacement Lender shall otherwise comply with Section 9.05
.

SECTION 2.20 [Reserved].

SECTION 2.21 Illegality. If any Lender reasonably determines that any 
change in law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has 
asserted after the Closing Date that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its 
applicable lending office to make or maintain any Eurocurrency Loans, then, 
on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative 
Agent, any obligations of such Lender to make or continue Eurocurrency 
Loans or to convert ABR Borrowings to Eurocurrency Borrowings shall be 
suspended until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the 
Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer 
exist. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower shall upon demand from 
such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), either convert all 
Eurocurrency Borrowings of such Lender to ABR Borrowings, either on the 
last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully 
continue to maintain such Eurocurrency Borrowings to such day, or 
immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such 
Loans. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay 
accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted.

SECTION 2.22 Cash Collateral.

(a) Certain Credit Support Events. Upon the request of the Administrative 
Agent or any Issuing Bank if, as of the expiration date for all Letters of 
Credit set forth in Section 2.05(c), any L/C Exposure for any reason 
remains outstanding, the Borrower shall, in each case, immediately Cash 
Collateralize the then outstanding amount of all L/C Exposure.

(b) Grant of Security Interest. All Cash Collateral (other than credit 
support not constituting funds subject to deposit) shall be maintained in 
blocked, non-interest bearing deposit accounts at a bank to be reasonably 
agreed between the Administrative Agent and the Borrower. The Borrower, and 
to the extent provided by any Lender, such Lender, hereby grants to (and 
subjects to the control of) the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the 
Administrative Agent, the applicable Issuing Bank and the Lenders 
(including the Swingline Lender), and agrees
 
-85-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
to maintain, a first priority security interest in all such cash, deposit 
accounts and all balances therein, and all other property so provided as 
collateral pursuant hereto, and in all proceeds of the foregoing, all as 
security for the obligations to which such Cash Collateral may be applied 
pursuant to Section 2.22(c). If at any time the Administrative Agent or the 
Collateral Agent determines that Cash Collateral is subject to any right or 
claim of any person other than the Collateral Agent as herein provided, or 
that the total amount of such Cash Collateral is less than the applicable 
Fronting Exposure and other obligations secured thereby, then (i) the 
Borrower (solely to the extent that the applicable Cash Collateral was 
provided by the Borrower), or (ii) the relevant Defaulting Lender (solely 
to the extent that the applicable Cash Collateral was provided by such 
Defaulting Lender) will, promptly upon demand by the Administrative Agent, 
pay or provide to the Collateral Agent additional Cash Collateral in an 
amount sufficient to eliminate such deficiency.

(c) Application. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this 
Agreement, Cash Collateral provided under any of this Section 2.22 or 
Sections 2.04, 2.05, 2.11, 2.23 or 7.01 in respect of Letters of Credit or 
Swingline Loans shall be held and applied to the satisfaction of the 
specific Letter of Credit obligations, Swingline Loans, obligations to fund 
participations therein (including, as to Cash Collateral provided by a 
Defaulting Lender, any interest accrued on such obligation) and other 
obligations for which the Cash Collateral was so provided, prior to any 
other application of such property as may be provided for herein.

(d) Release. Cash Collateral (or the appropriate portion thereof) provided 
to reduce Fronting Exposure or other obligations shall be released promptly 
following (i) the elimination of the applicable Fronting Exposure or other 
obligations giving rise thereto (including by the termination of Defaulting 
Lender status of the applicable Lender (or, as appropriate, its assignee 
following compliance with Section 9.04(b)(ii))) or (ii) the Administrative 
Agents good faith determination that there exists excess Cash Collateral; 
provided, however, (x) that Cash Collateral furnished by or on behalf of a 
Loan Party shall not be released during the continuance of a Default or 
Event of Default (and following application as provided in this Section 
2.22 may be otherwise applied in accordance with Section 7.01), and (y) the 
person providing Cash Collateral and the Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender, 
as applicable, may agree that Cash Collateral shall not be released but 
instead held to support future anticipated Fronting Exposure or other 
obligations.

SECTION 2.23 Defaulting Lenders.

(a) Adjustments. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this 
Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time 
as that Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by 
applicable Law:

(i) Waivers and Amendments. That Defaulting Lenders right to approve or 
disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement 
shall be restricted as set forth in Section 9.09.

(ii) Reallocation of Payments. Any payment of principal, interest, fees or 
other amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the account of that 
Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to 
Article VII or otherwise, and including any amounts made available to the 
Administrative Agent by that
 
-86-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 9.06), shall be applied at such time 
or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent as follows: 
first, to the payment of any amounts owing by that Defaulting Lender to the 
Administrative Agent hereunder; second, to the payment on a pro rata basis 
of any amounts owing by that Defaulting Lender to the Issuing Bank or 
Swingline Lender hereunder; third, if so determined by the Administrative 
Agent or requested by the Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender, to be held as 
Cash Collateral for future funding obligations of that Defaulting Lender of 
any participation in any Swingline Loan or Letter of Credit; fourth, as the 
Borrower may request (so long as no Default or Event of Default exists), to 
the funding of any Loan in respect of which that Defaulting Lender has 
failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as 
determined by the Administrative Agent; fifth, if so determined by the 
Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to be held in a non-interest 
bearing deposit account and released in order to satisfy obligations of 
that Defaulting Lender to fund Loans under this Agreement; sixth, to the 
payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders, the Issuing Bank or Swingline 
Lender as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction 
obtained by any Lender, Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender against that 
Defaulting Lender as a result of that Defaulting Lenders breach of its 
obligations under this Agreement; seventh, so long as no Default or Event 
of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower as a 
result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the 
Borrower against that Defaulting Lender as a result of that Defaulting 
Lenders breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and eighth, to 
that Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent 
jurisdiction; provided that if (x) such payment is a payment of the 
principal amount of any Loans or L/C Borrowings in respect of which that 
Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share and (y) such 
Loans or L/C Borrowings were made at a time when the conditions set forth 
in Section 4.01 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied 
solely to pay the Loans of, and L/C Borrowings owed to, all non-Defaulting 
Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any 
Loans of, or L/C Borrowings to, that Defaulting Lender. Any payments, 
prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that 
are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post 
Cash Collateral pursuant to this Section 2.22(a)(ii) shall be deemed paid 
to and redirected by that Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably 
consents hereto.

(iii) Certain Fees. The Defaulting Lender (x) shall not be entitled to 
receive any Commitment Fee pursuant to Section 2.12(a) for any period 
during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and the Borrower shall not 
be required to pay any such fee that otherwise would have been required to 
have been paid to that Defaulting Lender), and (y) shall be limited in its 
right to receive L/C Participation Fees as provided in Section 2.12(b).

(iv) Reallocation of Applicable Percentages to Reduce Fronting Exposure. 
During any period in which there is a Defaulting Lender, for purposes of 
computing the amount of the obligation of each non-Defaulting Lender to 
acquire, refinance or fund participations in Letters of Credit or Swingline 
Loans pursuant to Sections 2.04 and 2.05, the Applicable Percentage of 
each non-Defaulting Lender shall be computed without giving effect to the 
Commitment of that Defaulting Lender; provided, that, (i) each such
 
-87-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
reallocation shall be given effect only if, at the date the applicable 
Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, no Default or Event of Default exists; 
and (ii) the aggregate obligation of each non-Defaulting Lender to acquire, 
refinance or fund participations in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans 
shall not exceed the positive difference, if any, of (1) the Commitment of 
that non-Defaulting Lender minus (2) the aggregate outstanding amount of 
the Loans of that Lender.

(b) Defaulting Lender Cure. If the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, 
Swingline Lender and the Issuing Bank agree in writing in their sole 
discretion that a Defaulting Lender should no longer be deemed to be a 
Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties 
hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and 
subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements 
with respect to any Cash Collateral), that Lender will, to the extent 
applicable, purchase that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders 
or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be 
necessary to cause the Loans and funded and unfunded participations in 
Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans to be held on a pro rata basis by the 
Lenders in accordance with their Applicable Percentages (without giving 
effect to Section 2.23(a)(iv)), whereupon that Lender will cease to be a 
Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively 
with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the 
Borrower while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided, further, 
that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected 
parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will 
constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising 
from that Lenders having been a Defaulting Lender.

copies of which have heretofore been furnished to each Lender, which have 
been prepared giving effect to the Transactions (as if such events had 
occurred on such date). The Pro Forma Closing Balance Sheet has been

its ability to conduct its business as currently conducted or to utilize 
such properties and assets for their intended purposes and except where the 
failure to have such title, interests or easements could not reasonably be

obligations under all leases to which it is a party, except where the 
failure to comply would not reasonably be considered to have Material 
Adverse Effect, and all such leases are in full force and effect, except 
leases in respect of which the failure to be in full force and effect could 
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Except as set 
forth on Schedule 3.07(b), the Borrower and each of the Subsidiaries enjoys 
peaceful and undisturbed possession under all such leases, other than 
leases in respect of which the failure to enjoy peaceful and undisturbed 
possession could not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the

Borrower or any of its subsidiaries or any business, property or rights of 
any such person (i) that involve any Loan Document or the Transactions or 
(ii) could reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the 
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect or materially adversely affect the 
Transactions. As of the date of any Borrowing after the Closing Date, there 
are no actions, suits or proceedings at law or in equity or, to the 
knowledge of the Borrower, investigations by or on behalf of any 
Governmental Authority or in arbitration now pending, or, to the knowledge 
of the Borrower, threatened in writing against or affecting Holdings or the 
Borrower or any of its subsidiaries or any business, property or rights of 
any such person which could reasonably be expected to have, individually or

(b) None of Holdings, the Borrower, the Subsidiaries or their respective 
properties or assets is in violation of (nor will the continued operation

Effect. Nor has Holdings, the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries been 
advised since December 31, 2015 by any Governmental Authority that it is 
considering issuing, initiating, ordering, or requesting any such 
Regulatory Agreement that could reasonably be expected to have a Material 
Adverse Effect. Holdings, the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries is in 
compliance with each Regulatory Agreement to which it is party or subject, 
other than to the extent such noncompliance could not reasonably be 
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse 
Effect, and neither Holdings, the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries has 
received any notice from any Governmental Authority indicating that either 
Holdings, the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries is not in compliance with

purchase or carry Margin Stock or to extend credit to others for the 
purpose of purchasing or carrying Margin Stock or to refund indebtedness 
originally incurred for such purpose, or (ii) for any purpose that entails 
a violation of, or that is inconsistent with, the provisions of the 
Regulations of the Board, including Regulation U or Regulation X.

SECTION 3.11 Investment Company Act; Public Utility Holding Company Act.

Transactions. The Borrower will use the proceeds of the Revolving Facility 
Loans and the Swingline Loans for working capital needs and other general 
corporate purposes (including, without limitation, for Permitted Business 
Acquisitions and to make Permitted Investments). The Borrower will use the

in Switzerland as interpreted by Swiss tax authorities for purposes of 
Swiss withholding tax (Verrechnungssteuer), except and to the extent that a 
written confirmation or tax ruling countersigned by the Swiss Federal Tax 
Administration (Eidgenössische Steuerverwaltung) has been obtained (in a 
form satisfactory to the Administrative Agent) confirming that the intended 
use of proceeds in Switzerland does not result therein that interest 
payments in respect of a Credit Facility become subject to a withholding or 
deduction for Swiss withholding tax (Verrechnungssteuer).

assurances are being given that the results reflected in the forecasts and

Mortgaged Property thereunder and the proceeds thereof, and when such 
Mortgages are filed or recorded in the proper real estate filing or

rights of a person pursuant to Liens expressly permitted by Section 6.02.

Security Document (excluding the Foreign Pledge Agreements, the Foreign 
Security Documents, the Collateral Agreement and the Mortgages, each of 
which is covered by another paragraph of this Section 3.17), when executed 
and delivered, will be effective under applicable law to create in favor of 
the Collateral Agent (for the benefit of the Secured Parties) a legal,

assessment, charge, levy or claim so long as (a) the validity or amount 
thereof shall be contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings, (b) 
Holdings, the Borrower or the affected Subsidiary, as applicable, shall

terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any 
Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of 
this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument

SECTION 8.04 Reliance by Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent 
shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for 
relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, 
instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, 
Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it 
to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by 
the proper person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any 
statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been 
made by the proper person, and shall not incur any liability for relying 
thereon. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the 
making of a Loan, or the issuance of a Letter of Credit, that by its terms 
must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender or an Issuing Bank, the 
Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to 
such Lender or an Issuing Bank unless the Administrative Agent shall have 
received notice to the contrary from such Lender or an Issuing Bank prior 
to the making of such Loan or the issuance of such Letter of Credit. The 
Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for 
the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, 
and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in 
accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.

SECTION 8.05 Delegation of Duties. The Administrative Agent may perform any 
and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under 
any other Loan Document by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed 
by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such 
sub-agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and 
powers by or through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory 
provisions of this Article VIII shall apply to any such sub-agent and to 
the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, 
and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the 
syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as 
activities as Administrative Agent.

SECTION 8.06 Resignation of the Administrative Agent and the Collateral 
Agent. (a) The Administrative Agent and/or Collateral Agent may at any time 
give to the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the Borrower notice of its 
resignation as Administrative Agent and/or Collateral Agent. Upon receipt 
of any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the 
right, in consultation with the Borrower, to appoint a successor, which 
shall be a bank with an office in the United States, or an Affiliate of any 
such bank with an office in the United States, and the Administrative Agent 
and/or Collateral Agent, as applicable further agrees that for the 30 day 
period immediately following its notice of resignation, it will not appoint 
a successor unless the Borrower shall have consented to such successor, 
such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. If no such 
successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall 
have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring 
Administrative Agent and/or Collateral Agent gives notice of its 
resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may on behalf of the 
Lenders and the Issuing Banks, appoint a successor Administrative Agent 
and/or Collateral Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above; 
provided that if the Administrative Agent and/or Collateral Agent shall 
notify the Borrower and the Lenders that no qualifying person has accepted 
such appointment, then such resignation shall nonetheless become effective 
in accordance with such notice and (1) the retiring Administrative Agent 
and/or Collateral Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations 
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (except in its capacity as 
Collateral Agent holding collateral security on behalf of any Secured 
Parties, it shall continue to hold such collateral security as nominee 
until such time as a successor Collateral Agent is appointed) and (2) all 
payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or 
through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender 
and the Issuing Banks directly, until such time as the Required Lenders 
appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided for above in this 
Section. Upon the acceptance of a successors appointment as Administrative 
Agent and/or Collateral Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to 
and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of 
the retiring (or retired) Administrative Agent and/or Collateral Agent, and 
the retiring Administrative Agent and/or Collateral shall be discharged 
from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan 
Documents (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this 
Section). The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative 
Agent and/or Collateral Agent shall be the same as those payable to its 
predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such 
successor. After the retiring Administrative Agents and/or Collateral 
Agents resignation hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the 
provisions of this Article VIII and Section 9.05 shall continue in effect 
for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent and/or Collateral 
Agent, its sub agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of 
any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring 
Administrative Agent and/or Collateral Agent was acting as Administrative 
Agent and/or Collateral Agent.
 
-145-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(b) Any resignation by HPS Investment Partners, LLC as Administrative Agent 
pursuant to this Section shall also constitute its resignation as Issuing 
Bank and Swingline Lender. Upon the acceptance of a successors appointment 
as Administrative Agent hereunder, (a) such successor shall succeed to and 
become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the 
retiring Issuing Bank and Swingline Lender, (b) the retiring the Swingline 
Lender shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder 
and under the other Loan Documents, and (c) at the sole election of the 
retiring Administrative Agent, in its capacity as an Issuing Bank, either 
(i) the retiring Administrative Agent, in its capacity as an Issuing Bank, 
shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder and 
under the other Loan Documents, and the successor Issuing Bank shall issue 
letters of credit in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any, 
outstanding at the time of such succession or make other arrangements 
satisfactory to the retiring Issuing Bank to effectively assume the 
obligations of the retiring Issuing Bank with respect to such Letters of 
Credit or (ii) the retiring Administrative Agent, in its capacity as an 
Issuing Bank, shall remain party to this Agreement as an Issuing Bank, and 
in such capacity shall continue to have all of the rights and obligations 
of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents with 
respect to each Letter of Credit previously issued by such Issuing Bank and 
outstanding at the time of its resignation as Administrative Agent 
(including, without limitation, the right to receive Issuing Bank Fees 
pursuant to Section 2.12(b)), but shall not be required to issue any new 
(or renew or extend any existing) Letters of Credit.

SECTION 8.07 Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent and Other Lenders. Each 
Lender and the Issuing Banks acknowledges that it has, independently and 
without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any 
of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it 
has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter 
into this Agreement. Each Lender and each Issuing Bank also acknowledges 
that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative 
Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such 
documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, 
continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or 
based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement 
or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder

SECTION 8.08 No Other Duties, Etc. Anything herein to the contrary 
notwithstanding, none of the Lead Arranger or Agents listed on the cover 
page hereof shall have any powers, duties or responsibilities under this 
Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, except in its capacity, as 
applicable, as the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, a Lender or 
an Issuing Bank hereunder.

SECTION 8.09 Administrative Agent May File Proofs of Claim. In case of the 
pendency of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or any other 
judicial proceeding relative to any Loan Party, the Administrative Agent 
(irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan or L/C Borrowing shall 
then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise 
and irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any 
demand on the Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in 
such proceeding or otherwise
 
-146-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(a) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and 
interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans, Letters of Credit and 
all other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other 
documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of 
the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the Administrative Agent (including any 
claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances 
of the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the Administrative Agent and their 
respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due the Lenders, the 
Issuing Banks and the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.12 and 9.05) 
allowed in such judicial proceeding; and

(b) to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or 
deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;

and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or 
other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized 
by each Lender and the Issuing Banks to make such payments to the 
Administrative Agent and, in the event that the Administrative Agent shall 
consent to the making of such payments directly to the Lenders and the 
Issuing Banks, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for the 
reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the 
Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due 
the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.12 and 9.05.

Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative 
Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender 
or the Issuing Banks any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or 
composition affecting the Obligations or the rights of any Lender or the 
Issuing Banks to authorize the Administrative Agent to vote in respect of 
the claim of any Lender or the Issuing Banks in any such proceeding.

SECTION 8.10 Collateral Agreement. (a) (i) The Lenders and the Issuing 
Banks irrevocably authorize the Collateral Agent, at its option and in its 
discretion, to release any Lien on any property granted to or held by the 
Collateral Agent under any Loan Document (A) upon termination of the 
Commitments and payment in full of all Obligations (other than contingent 
indemnification obligations) and the expiration or termination of all 
Letters of Credit (other than Letters of Credit as to which other 
arrangements satisfactory to the Collateral Agent and the Issuing Banks 
shall have been made), (B) that is sold or to be sold to a party that is 
not a Loan Party as part of or in connection with any sale permitted 
hereunder or under any other Loan Document, or (C) subject to Section 9.09
, if approved, authorized or ratified in writing by the Required Lenders.

(ii) to subordinate any Lien on any property granted to or held by the 
Collateral Agent under any Loan Document to the holder of any Lien on such 
property that is permitted by clauses (i) or (j) of Section 6.02.

(b) The Lenders and the Issuing Banks irrevocably authorize the 
Administrative Agent, at its option and in its discretion, to release any 
guarantor from its obligations under the Guaranty Agreement and the other 
Security Documents if such person ceases to be a Loan Party as a result of 
a transaction permitted hereunder.

Upon request by the Administrative Agent at any time, each of the Required 
Lenders will confirm in writing the Administrative Agents or Collateral 
Agents, as applicable, authority to release or subordinate its interest in 
particular types or items of property, or to release any guarantor from its 
obligations under the Guarantee and the other Security Documents.
 
-147-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 8.11 Withholding Tax. To the extent required by any applicable laws 
(as determined in good faith by the Administrative Agent), the 
Administrative Agent may withhold from any payment to any Lender or under 
any Loan Document an amount equivalent to any applicable withholding Tax. 
Without limiting or expanding the provisions of Section 2.17, each Lender 
shall indemnify and hold harmless the Administrative Agent against, and 
shall make payment in respect thereof within 10 days after demand therefor, 
any and all Taxes and any and all related losses, claims, liabilities and 
expenses (including fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for the 
Administrative Agent) incurred by or asserted against the Administrative 
Agent by the IRS or any other Governmental Authority as a result of the 
failure of the Administrative Agent to properly withhold Tax from amounts 
paid to or for the account of such Lender for any reason (including because 
the appropriate form was not delivered or not properly executed, or because 
such Lender failed to notify the Administrative Agent of a change in 
circumstance that rendered the exemption from, or reduction of withholding 
Tax ineffective). A certificate as to the amount of such payment or 
liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be 
conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the 
Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time 
owing to such Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan Document 
against any amount due the Administrative Agent under this Section 8.11. 
The agreements in this Section 8.11 shall survive the resignation and/or 
replacement of the Administrative Agent, any assignment of rights by, or 
the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the 
repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other Obligations.

or 2.17 shall be limited to the amount, if any, that would have been 
payable hereunder by the Borrower in the absence of such assignment; 
provided further that the Borrower shall be deemed to have consented to any 
such assignment unless it shall object thereto by written notice to the 
Administrative Agent within ten days after having received notice thereof;

$5,000,000 in respect of the Revolving Facility Loans, unless each of the 
Borrower and the Administrative Agent otherwise consent; provided that 
simultaneous assignments to two or more Related Funds or by two or more 
Related Funds to a single Assignee shall be treated as one assignment for 
purposes of the minimum assignment requirement, and shall be in an amount 
that is an integral multiple of $1,000,000 (or the entire remaining amount 
of such Lenders Commitment);

(B) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the

Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution 
thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the 
assignee of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating 
actions, including funding, with the consent of the Borrower and the 
Administrative Agent, the applicable pro rata share of Loans previously 
requested but not funded by the Defaulting Lender, to each of which the

Lender to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder (and interest 
accrued thereon) and (y) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full pro 
rata share of all Loans and participations in Letters of Credit and 
Swingline Loans in accordance with its Applicable Percentage. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights 
and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective 
under applicable Law without compliance with the provisions of this 
paragraph, then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a 
Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance 
occurs.

For the purposes of this Section 9.04, Approved Fund means any person 
(other than a natural person) that is or will be engaged in making,

(c) an entity or an Affiliate of an entity that administers or manages a 
Lender.

(iii) Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to paragraph 
(b)(v) below, from and after the effective date specified in each 
Assignment and Acceptance (which shall be the date of such recordation) the 
Assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the 
interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and 
obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender 
thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment 
and Acceptance, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, 
in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all of the assigning 
Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall 
cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to
 
-152-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.05). Any 
assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this 
Agreement that does not comply with this Section 9.04 shall be treated for 
purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in 
such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (c) of this 
Section.

(iv) The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as a 
non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices 
in the United States of America a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance 
delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and 
addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts 
(and stated interest) of the Loans and L/C Exposure owing to, each Lender 
pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the Register). The 
entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the 
Borrower, the Administrative Agent, Issuing Bank and the Lenders shall 
treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the 
terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement. The 
Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower, the Issuing 
Bank and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon 
reasonable prior notice.

(v) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Acceptance executed 
by an assigning Lender and an Assignee, all documents required under 
Section 9.04(b)(ii)(C) (unless the Assignee shall already be a Lender 
hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) 
of this Section and any written consent to such assignment required by 
paragraph (b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such 
Assignment and Acceptance and record the information contained therein in 
the Register. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this 
Agreement unless and until it has been recorded in the Register as provided 
in this paragraph, provided that for the avoidance of doubt, the date that 
is the later of (i) the trade date specified (if any) in the Assignment and 
Assumption and (ii) the day such Assignment and Assumption has been 
recorded in the Register shall be the effective date of the assignment.

(c) (i) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower or the 
Administrative Agent, sell participations to one or more banks or other 
entities (other than a natural person, or the Borrower or any of the 
Affiliated Lenders) (a Participant) in all or a portion of such Lenders 
rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of 
its Commitments and the Loans owing to it); provided, that (a) such 
Lenders obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (b) such 
Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the 
performance of such obligations and (c) the Borrower, the Administrative 
Agent, the Issuing Bank and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely 
and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lenders rights and 
obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to 
which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender 
shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and the other Loan 
Documents and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any 
provision of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents; provided, that 
(x) such agreement may provide that such Lender will not, without the 
consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver 
that (1) requires the consent of each Lender directly affected thereby 
pursuant to Section 9.04(a)(i) or clause (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (v) or 
(vi) of the first proviso to Section 9.09(b) and (2) directly affects such 
Participant and (y) no other agreement with respect to such Participant may 
exist between such Lender and such Participant.
 
-153-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(ii) The Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the 
benefits of Sections 2.16 and 2.17 (subject to the requirements and 
limitations therein, including the requirements under Section 2.17(g) (it 
being understood that the documentation required under Section 2.17(g) 
shall be delivered to the participating Lender)) to the same extent as if 
it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to 
paragraph (b) of this Section; provided that such Participant (A) agrees to 
be subject to the provisions of Section 2.19 as if it were an assignee 
under paragraph (b) of this Section; and (B) shall not be entitled to 
receive any greater payment under Sections 2.16 or 2.17, with respect to 
any participation, than its participating Lender would have been entitled 
to receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater 
payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the Participant 
acquired the applicable participation. Each Lender that sells a 
participation agrees, at the Borrowers request and expense, to use 
reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrower to effectuate the 
provisions of Section 2.19 with respect to any Participant. To the extent 
permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits 
of Section 9.06 as though it were a Lender; provided that such Participant 
agrees to be subject to Section 2.18(c) as though it were a Lender. Each 
Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as 
a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it 
enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts 
(and stated interest) of each Participants interest in the Loans or other 
obligations under the Loan Documents (the Participant Register); 
provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any 
portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any 
Participant or any information relating to a Participants interest in any 
commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any 
Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is 
necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or 
other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the 
United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register 
shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each 
Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of 
such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any 
notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative 
Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no 
responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.

(d) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Administrative Agent or the 
Borrower, at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any 
portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such 
Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a 
Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge 
or assignment of a security interest; provided, that no such pledge or 
assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its 
obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or Assignee for such 
Lender as a party hereto.
 
-154-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(e) The Borrower, at its expense and upon receipt of written notice from 
the relevant Lender, agrees to issue Notes to any Lender requiring Notes to 
facilitate transactions of the type described in paragraph (d) above.

(f) [Reserved].

(g) Notwithstanding the foregoing, no assignment may be made or 
participation sold to (i) a natural person, (ii) an Ineligible Institution 
without the prior written consent of the Borrower, (iii) any Defaulting 
Lender or any of its subsidiaries, or any person who, upon becoming a 
Lender hereunder, would constitute any of the foregoing persons described 
in this clause (iii) or (iv) any Affiliated Lenders, except as provided in 
section (h) below. Upon the request of any Lender, the Administrative Agent 
shall inform such Lender as to whether an actual proposed Participant or 
Assignee is an Ineligible Institution.

(h) Assignments to Affiliated Lenders. Notwithstanding anything in this 
Agreement to the contrary, any Term Lender may, at any time, assign all or 
a portion of its Term Loans on a non-pro rata basis to an Affiliated 
Lender, subject to the following limitations:

(i) In connection with an assignment to an Affiliated Lender, (A) the 
Affiliated Lender shall have identified itself in writing as an Affiliated 
Lender to the assigning Term Lender and the Administrative Agent prior to 
the execution of such assignment and (B) the Affiliated Lender shall be 
deemed to have represented and warranted to the assigning Term Lender and 
the Administrative Agent that the requirements set forth in this Section 
9.04(h)(i) and Section 9.04(h)(iv) below shall have been satisfied upon 
consummation of the applicable assignment;

(ii) Affiliated Lenders will not (A) have the right to receive information, 
reports or other materials provided solely to Lenders by the Administrative 
Agent and/or the Collateral Agent or any other Lender, except to the extent 
made available to the Borrower, (B) attend or participate in meetings 
attended solely by the Lenders and the Administrative Agent and/or the 
Collateral Agent or (C) access any electronic site established for the 
Lenders or confidential communications from counsel to or financial 
advisors of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or the Lenders;

(iii) (A) for purposes of any consent to any amendment, waiver or 
modification of, or any action under, and for the purpose of any direction 
to the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Lender to 
undertake any action (or refrain from taking any action) under, this 
Agreement or any other Loan Document, each Affiliated Lender will be deemed 
to have consented in the same proportion as the Term Lenders that are not 
Affiliated Lenders consented to such matter, unless such matter requires 
the consent of all or all affected Lenders and adversely affects such 
Affiliated Lender more than other Term Lenders in any material respect, (B) 
for purposes of voting on any plan of reorganization or plan of liquidation 
pursuant to any Debtor Relief Laws (a Bankruptcy Plan), each Affiliated 
Lender hereby agrees (x) not to vote on such Bankruptcy Plan, (y) if such 
Affiliated Lender does vote on such Bankruptcy Plan notwithstanding the 
restriction in the foregoing clause (x), such vote will be deemed not to be 
in good faith and shall be designated pursuant to Section 1126(e) of the 
Bankruptcy Code (or any similar provision in any other Debtor Relief Laws), 
and such vote shall not be counted in
 
-155-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
determining whether the applicable class has accepted or rejected such 
Bankruptcy Plan in accordance with Section 1126(c) of the Bankruptcy Code 
(or any similar provision in any other Debtor Relief Laws) and (z) not to 
contest any request by any party for a determination by a court of 
competent jurisdiction effectuating the foregoing clause (y), in each case 
under this clause (B) unless such Bankruptcy Plan adversely affects such 
Affiliated Lender more than other Term Lenders in any material respect and 
(C) each Affiliated Lender hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative 
Agent (such appointment being coupled with an interest) as such Affiliate 
of the Borrowers attorney-in-fact, with full authority in the place and 
stead of such Affiliate of the Borrower and in the name of such Affiliated 
Lender (solely in respect of Term Loans held by such Affiliated Lender and 
not in respect of any other claim or status such Affiliated Lender may 
otherwise have), from time to time in the Administrative Agents discretion 
to take any action and to execute any instrument that the Administrative 
Agent may deem reasonably necessary or appropriate to carry out the 
provisions of this Section 9.04(h)(iii), including to ensure that any vote 
of such Affiliated Lender on any Bankruptcy Plan is withdrawn or otherwise 
not counted;

(iv) the aggregate principal amount of Term Loans held at any one time by 
Affiliated Lenders may not exceed 25% of the aggregate outstanding 
principal amount of Term Loans;

(v) the Affiliated Lender will not be entitled to bring actions against the 
Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, in its role as such, or 
receive advice of counsel or other advisors to the Administrative Agent, 
the Collateral Agent or any Lender or challenge the attorney-client 
privilege of their respective counsel; and

(vi) the Loans held by any Affiliated Lenders in the aggregate shall not 
account for more than 49.9% of the amounts included in determining whether 
the Required Lenders have (A) consented to any amendment, modification, 
waiver, consent or other action with respect to any of the terms of any 
Loan Document or any departure by any Loan Party therefrom, (B) otherwise 
acted on any matter related to any Loan Document or (C) directed or 
required the Administrative Agent or any Lender to undertake any action (or 
refrain from taking any action) with respect to or under any Loan Document.

Each Affiliated Lender that is a Term Lender hereunder agrees to comply 
with the terms of this Section 9.04(h) (notwithstanding that it may be 
granted access to the Platform or any other electronic site established for 
the Lenders by the Administrative Agent), and each Affiliated Lenders 
agrees that in any subsequent assignment of all or any portion of its Term 
Loans it shall identify itself in writing to the assignee as an Affiliated 
Lender prior to the execution of such assignment.

(i) Resignation as an Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender after Assignment. 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if at any time 
Issuing Bank assigns all of its Revolving Facility Commitment and Revolving 
Facility Loans pursuant to Section 9.04(b), such Issuing Bank may, (i) upon 
30 days notice to the Borrower and the Lenders, resign as an Issuing Bank 
and/or (ii) upon 30 days notice to the Borrower, resign as
 
-156-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Swingline Lender. In the event of any such resignation as an Issuing Bank 
or Swingline Lender, the Borrower shall be entitled to appoint from among 
the Lenders a successor Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender hereunder; 
provided, however, that no failure by the Borrower to appoint any such 
successor shall affect the resignation of such Issuing Bank as an Issuing 
Bank or Swingline Lender, as the case may be. If such Issuing Bank resigns 
as an Issuing Bank, it shall retain all the rights, powers, privileges and 
duties of an Issuing Bank hereunder with respect to all Letters of Credit 
outstanding as of the effective date of its resignation as an Issuing Bank 
and all unreimbursed L/C Disbursements with respect thereto (including the 
right to require the Lenders to make ABR Loans or fund risk participations 
in unreimbursed amounts pursuant to Section 2.05(c)). If the Swingline 
Lender resigns as Swingline Lender, it shall retain all the rights of the 
Swingline Lender provided for hereunder with respect to Swingline Loans 
made by it and outstanding as of the effective date of such resignation, 
including the right to require the Lenders to fund risk participations in 
outstanding Swingline Loans pursuant to Section 2.04(b). Upon the 
appointment of a successor Issuing Bank and/or Swingline Lender, (a) such 
successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, 
powers, privileges and duties of a retiring Issuing Bank or Swingline 
Lender, as the case may be, and (b) the successor Issuing Banks shall issue 
letters of credit in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any, 
outstanding at the time of such succession or make other arrangements 
satisfactory to the resigning Issuing Bank to effectively assume the 
obligations of such Issuing Bank with respect to such Letters of Credit.

SECTION 9.05 Expenses; Indemnity. (a) The Borrower agrees to pay (i) all 
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including Other Taxes) incurred by the 
Administrative Agent and its Affiliates in connection with the syndication 
of the credit facilities provided for herein, the preparation, negotiation, 
execution and delivery and administration of this Agreement and the other

described in clauses (i) through (ii) above, taken as a whole, (y) in the 
case of any actual or perceived conflict of interest, one outside legal 
counsel for each group of affected Persons similarly situated, taken as a 
whole, in each appropriate jurisdiction and (z) if necessary, one local or 
foreign legal counsel in each appropriate jurisdiction (which may include a

-157-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(b) The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, Lead Arranger, 
the Agents, each Issuing Bank, each Lender, their respective Affiliates and 
each of their respective directors, trustees, officers, employees and

each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages,

against any Indemnitee arising out of, in any way connected with, or as a 
result of (i) the execution or delivery of this Agreement or any other Loan 
Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby, the 
performance by the parties hereto and thereto of their respective 
obligations thereunder or the consummation of the Transactions and the 
other transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) any Loan or Letter of Credit

prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any 
of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory, 
whether brought by a third party, by the Borrower or any other Loan Party 
or any of the Borrowers or such Loan Partys directors, shareholders or 
creditors; provided, that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, 
be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities 
or related expenses are (x) determined by a court of competent jurisdiction 
by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted primarily from the 
gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee or (y) result 
from a claim brought by the Borrower or any other Loan Party against an 
Indemnitee for breach in bad faith of such Indemnitees obligations 
hereunder or under any other Loan Document, if the Borrower or such Loan 
Party has obtained a final and nonappealable judgment in its favor on such 
claim as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction. The provisions of 
this Section 9.05 shall remain operative and in full force and effect 
regardless of the expiration of the term of this Agreement, the 
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment, 
satisfaction and discharge of any of the Obligations, the resignation of 
the Administrative Agent or any Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, the 
invalidity or unenforceability of any term or provision of this Agreement 
or any other Loan Document, or any investigation made by or on behalf of 
the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender. All amounts due 
under this Section 9.05 shall be payable no later than ten Business Days 
after written demand therefor, accompanied by reasonable documentation with 
respect to any reimbursement, indemnification or other amount requested. 
This Section 9.05(b) shall not apply with respect to Taxes other than any 
Taxes that represent losses, claims, damages, etc. arising from any 
non-Tax claim.

(c) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrower shall 
not assert, and hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any 
theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive 
damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in 
connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement, any other Loan Document 
or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the transactions 
contemplated hereby or thereby, any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of 
the proceeds thereof. No Indemnitee referred to in subsection (b) above 
shall be liable for any damages arising from the use by unintended 
recipients of any information or other materials distributed to such 
unintended recipients by such
 
-158-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Indemnitee through telecommunications, electronic or other information 
transmission systems in connection with this Agreement or the other Loan 
Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby other than for 
direct or actual damages resulting from the gross negligence or willful 
misconduct of such Indemnitee as determined by a final and nonappealable 
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction

(d) To the extent that the Borrower for any reason fails to indefeasibly 
pay any amount required under subsection (a) or (b) of this Section to be 
paid by it to the Administrative Agent (or any sub-agent thereof), any 
Issuing Bank or any Related Party of any of the foregoing, each Lender 
severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent (or any such 
sub-agent), the applicable Issuing Bank or such Related Party, as the case 
may be, such Lenders Applicable Percentage (determined as of the time that 
the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such 
unpaid amount, provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, 
claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was 
incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent (or any such 
sub-agent) or the applicable Issuing Bank in its capacity as such, or 
against any Related Party of any of the foregoing acting for the 
Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent) or applicable Issuing Bank in 
connection with such capacity. The obligations of the Lenders under this 
subsection (d) are subject to the provisions of Section 2.18(f).

SECTION 9.06 Right of Set-off. If an Event of Default shall have occurred 
and be continuing, each Lender and each Issuing Bank is hereby authorized 
at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, 
to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or 
demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other indebtedness at 
any time owing by such Lender or such Issuing Bank to or for the credit or 
the account of Holdings, the Borrower or any other Subsidiary against any 
of and all the obligations of Holdings or the Borrower now or hereafter 
existing under this Agreement or any other Loan Document held by such 
Lender or such Issuing Bank, irrespective of whether or not such Lender or 
such Issuing Bank shall have made any demand under this Agreement or such 
other Loan Document and although the obligations may be unmatured; 
provided, that in the event that any Defaulting Lender shall exercise any 
such right of setoff, (x) all amounts so set off shall be paid over 
immediately to the Administrative Agent for further application in 
accordance with the provisions of Section 2.23 and, pending such payment, 
shall be segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other funds and 
deemed held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the 
Lenders, and (y) the Defaulting Lender shall provide promptly to the 
Administrative Agent a statement describing in reasonable detail the 
Obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender as to which it exercised such 
right of setoff. The rights of each Lender and each Issuing Bank under this 
Section 9.06 are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other 
rights of set-off) that such Lender or such Issuing Bank may have.

SECTION 9.07 Payments Set Aside. To the extent that any payment by or on 
behalf of the Borrower is made to the Administrative Agent, the Collateral 
Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender, or the Administrative Agent, the 
Collateral Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender exercises its right of 
setoff, and such payment or the proceeds of such setoff or any part thereof 
is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set 
aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the 
Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, such Issuing Bank or such 
Lender in its discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or
 
-159-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
any other party, in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief 
Laws or otherwise, then (a) to the extent of such recovery, the obligation 
or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be revived and 
continued in full force and effect as if such payment had not been made or 
such setoff had not occurred, and (b) each Lender and each Issuing Bank 
severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent or the Collateral 
Agent, as applicable, upon demand its applicable share (without 
duplication) of any amount so recovered from or repaid by the 
Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent (as applicable), plus 
interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such payment is 
made at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Effective Rate from 
time to time in effect.

SECTION 9.08 Applicable Law. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS 
(OTHER THAN LETTERS OF CREDIT AND AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN OTHER LOAN 
DOCUMENTS) SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND GOVERNED BY THE LAWS 
OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

SECTION 9.09 Waivers; Amendment. (a) None of the Arranger, the Agents or 
the Lenders shall by any act (except by a written instrument pursuant to 
clause (b) below), delay, indulgence, omission or otherwise be deemed to 
have waived any right or remedy hereunder or to have acquiesced in any 
Default or Event of Default. No failure to exercise, nor any delay in 
exercising, on the part of any Arranger, Agent or Lender, any right, power 
or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof. No single or 
partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder shall preclude 
any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, 
power or privilege. A waiver by any Arranger, Agent or Lender of any right 
or remedy hereunder on any one occasion shall not be construed as a bar to 
any right or remedy which such Arranger, Agent or Lender would otherwise 
have on any future occasion. The rights and remedies herein provided are 
cumulative, may be exercised singly or concurrently and are not exclusive 
of any other rights or remedies provided by law.

(b) Neither this Agreement nor any other Loan Document nor any provision 
hereof or thereof may be waived, amended or modified, or (x) in the case of 
this Agreement, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered 
into by Holdings, the Borrower and the Required Lenders and (y) in the case 
of any other Loan Document, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in 
writing entered into by each party thereto and the Administrative Agent and 
consented to by the Required Lenders; provided, however, that no such 
agreement shall:

(i) decrease or forgive the principal amount of, or extend the final 
maturity of, or decrease the rate of interest on, any Loan or any L/C 
Disbursement without the prior written consent of each Lender directly 
affected thereby; provided that any amendment to the financial covenant 
definitions in this Agreement shall not constitute a reduction in the rate 
of interest for purposes of this clause (i),

(ii) increase or extend the Commitment of any Lender or decrease the 
Commitment Fees or L/C Participation Fees or other fees of any Lender 
without the prior written consent of such Lender (it being understood that 
waivers or modifications of conditions precedent, covenants, Defaults or 
Events of Default or of a mandatory prepayment or reduction in the 
aggregate Commitments shall not constitute an increase of the Commitments 
of any Lender or a decrease of fees of any Lender),
 
-160-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(iii) extend, waive or reduce the amount of any scheduled installment of 
principal or extend any date on which payment of interest on any Loan or 
any L/C Disbursement or any Fees is due, without the prior written consent 
of each Lender adversely affected thereby (it being understood that waivers 
or modifications of conditions precedent, covenants, Defaults or Events of 
Default or of a mandatory prepayment or reduction in the aggregate 
Commitments shall not constitute an extension, waiver or reduction of the 
amount of a scheduled installment of principal or date of payment of 
interest or fees),

(iv) amend or modify the provisions of Section 2.18(b) or (c) in a manner 
that would by its terms alter the pro rata sharing of payments required 
thereby, or require any Lender to make available Interest Periods longer 
than six months without its consent, without the prior written consent of 
the each Lender adversely affected thereby,

(v) amend or modify the provisions of this Section or the definition of the 
term Required Lenders or any other provision hereof specifying the number 
or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or modify any rights 
hereunder or make any determination or grant any consent hereunder, without 
the prior written consent of each Lender adversely affected thereby (it 
being understood that, with the consent of the Required Lenders, additional 
extensions of credit pursuant to this Agreement may be included in the 
determination of the Required Lenders on substantially the same basis as 
the applicable Loans and Commitments),

(vi) release all or substantially all the Collateral or release any of 
Holdings, the Borrower or any other Loan Party from its Guarantee under the 
Guaranty Agreement, unless, in the case of a Loan Party, all or 
substantially all of the Equity Interests of such Loan Party are sold or 
otherwise disposed of in a transaction permitted by this Agreement, without 
the prior written consent of each Lender,

(vii) subordinate the Liens in favor of the Administrative Agent or 
Collateral Agent, as applicable, securing the Obligations, with respect to 
all or substantially all of the Collateral, without the prior written 
consent of each Lender,

(viii) effect any waiver, amendment or modification that by its terms 
adversely affects the rights of Lenders participating in any Class of 
Loans, as the case may be, differently from those of Lenders participating 
in another Class of Loans, without the consent of the Majority Lenders 
participating in the adversely affected Class (it being agreed that the 
Required Lenders, may waive, in whole or in part, any prepayment required 
by Section 2.11 so long as the application of any prepayment still required 
to be made is not changed), and

(ix) effect any waiver, amendment or modification of Section 5.4 of the 
Collateral Agreement, or any comparable provision of any other Security 
Document, in a manner that materially adversely affects the rights in 
respect of payments or collateral of Lenders, without the consent of each 
Lender so affected;
 
-161-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
provided further that no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise 
affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent, the Swingline 
Lender or an Issuing Bank hereunder without the prior written consent of 
the Administrative Agent, the Swingline Lender or such Issuing Bank acting 
as such at the effective date of such agreement, as applicable. Each Lender 
shall be bound by any waiver, amendment or modification authorized by this 
Section 9.09 and any consent by any Lender pursuant to this Section 9.09 
shall bind any Assignee of such Lender.

(c) Without the consent of any Lender, the Loan Parties and the 
Administrative Agent may (in their respective sole discretion, or shall, to 
the extent required by any Loan Document) enter into any amendment, 
modification or waiver of any Loan Document, or enter into any new 
agreement or instrument, to effect the granting, perfection, protection, 
expansion or enhancement of any security interest in any Collateral or 
additional property to become Collateral for the benefit of the Secured 
Parties, or as required by local law to give effect to, or protect any 
security interest for the benefit of the Secured Parties, in any property 
or so that the security interests therein comply with applicable law.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Defaulting Lender 
shall have any right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or 
consent hereunder (and any amendment, waiver or consent which by its terms 
requires the consent of all Lenders or each affected Lender may be effected 
with the consent of the applicable Lenders other than Defaulting Lenders), 
except that (x) the Commitment of any Defaulting Lender may not be 
increased or extended without the consent of such Lender and (y) any other 
waiver, amendment or modification requiring the consent of all Lenders or 
each affected Lender that by its terms affects any Defaulting Lender more 
adversely than other affected Lenders shall require the consent of such 
Defaulting Lender.

(e) Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement may be amended (or amended and 
restated) with the written consent of the Required Lenders, the 
Administrative Agent, Holdings and the Borrower (a) to add one or more 
additional credit facilities to this Agreement and to permit the extensions 
of credit from time to time outstanding thereunder and the accrued interest 
and fees in respect thereof to share ratably in the benefits of this 
Agreement and the other Loan Documents with the Term Loans and the 
Revolving Facility Loans and the accrued interest and fees in respect 
thereof and (b) to include appropriately the Lenders holding such credit 
facilities in any determination of Required Lenders.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 9.09
, this Agreement may be amended with the written consent of the 
Administrative Agent, the Borrower and the Lenders providing the 
Replacement Term Loans (as defined below) to permit the refinancing of all 
or a portion of the outstanding Term Loans of any Class (Refinanced Term 
Loans) with one or more tranches of replacement term loans (Replacement 
Term Loans) hereunder; provided that (a) the aggregate principal amount of 
such Replacement Term Loans shall not exceed the aggregate principal amount 
of such Refinanced Term Loans (plus accrued interest, fees, expenses and 
premium), (b) the Effective Yield for such Replacement Term Loans shall not 
be higher than the Effective Yield for such Refinanced Term Loans, unless 
the final stated maturity of such Replacement Term Loans is at least one 
year later than the final stated maturity of such Refinanced Term Loans, 
(c) the Weighted Average Life to Maturity of Replacement Term Loans shall 
not be shorter than the Weighted Average Life to Maturity of such 
Refinanced Term Loans, at the time of such refinancing (except by virtue of

-162-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Replacement Term Loans have a final stated maturity equal to or later than 
the final stated maturity date of the Refinanced Term Loans at the time of 
such refinancing, (e) any Replacement Term Loans may participate on a pro 
rata basis or less than a pro rata basis (but not greater than a pro rata 
basis) in any voluntary or mandatory prepayment made by the Borrower 
pursuant to Section 2.11 with any Class of Term Loans that ranks pari passu 
as to security with such Replacement Term Loans (and junior basis as to any 
Class of Term Loans that ranks senior as to security with such Replacement 
Term Loans) and (f) all other terms applicable to such Replacement Term 
Loans (excluding pricing, interest, fees, rate floors, call, premiums and 
maturity date, subject to preceding clauses (b), (c) and (d)) shall be 
substantially identical to, or less favorable to the Lenders providing such 
Replacement Term Loans than, those applicable to such Refinanced Term 
Loans, except to the extent necessary to provide for covenants and other 
terms applicable to any period after the Latest Maturity Date in effect 
immediately prior to such refinancing.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 9.09
, if at any time after Closing Date, the Administrative Agent and the 
Borrower shall have jointly identified an obvious error or any error or 
omission of a technical nature, in each case, in any provision of the Loan 
Documents, then the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall be 
permitted to amend such provision and such amendment shall become effective 
without any further action or consent of any other party to any Loan 
Document if the same is not objected to in writing by the Required Lenders 
within five Business Days following receipt of notice thereof.

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 9.09
, any waiver, amendment or modification of this Agreement that (x) in the 
absence of this clause (h) would require the consent of the Required 
Lenders and (y) by its terms affects solely the rights, benefits, duties or 
obligations under this Agreement of one Class of Lenders and not any other 
Class of Lenders may, in each case, be effected by an agreement or 
agreements in writing entered into by the Borrower and Majority Lenders of 
such affected Class of Lenders (together with any other individual Lender 
directly affected thereby whose consent would be required by the first and 
second provisos appearing in Section 9.09(b)).

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or 
any other Loan Document, the Administrative Agent, the Borrower and the 
Revolving Facility Lenders shall be permitted to amend this Agreement in 
order to (i) add new or additional Issuing Banks and/or Swingline Lenders 
or to reflect that Letters of Credit may be issued by a Third Party LC 
Issuer, (ii) revise the Letter of Credit and Swingline provisions in this 
Agreement to accommodate the administrative or operational needs of such 
new or additional Issuing Bank, Third Party LC Issuer and/or Swingline 
Lenders, provided that (X) any such Issuing Banks and/or Swingline Lenders 
and any such revised provisions must be reasonably acceptable to the 
Administrative Agent and the Revolving Facility Lenders, and (Y) such 
amendments shall not be materially adverse to the Term Lenders, (iii) 
modify the required notice period for borrowing of Revolving Facility Loans 
and (iv) increase or decrease the L/C Commitment and Swingline Commitment 
amounts, provided that in no event shall such L/C Commitment or Swingline 
Commitment amounts exceed the Revolving Facility Commitment. Such 
amendment(s) shall become effective without any further action or consent 
of any other party to any Loan Document.
 
-163-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(j) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 9.09
, this Agreement and the other Loan Documents may be amended, restated, 
supplemented and/or otherwise modified with the written consent of the 
Administrative Agent, Holdings, the Borrower and the Required Lenders, in 
order to (i) increase the interest rate or yield applicable to the Credit 
Facilities, including by increasing the Applicable Margin or similar 
component of the interest rate, by modifying the method of computing 
interest applicable to the Credit Facilities (including by creating any new 
interest rate floors) or paying additional upfront fees, consent fees or 
original issue discount on or with respect to the Credit Facilities and 
(ii) increase a letter of credit, unused commitment, facility or 
utilization fee or other fees having similar effect under the Credit 
Facilities.

SECTION 9.10 Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding any other provision 
herein, the aggregate interest rate charged with respect to any of the 
Obligations, including all charges or fees in connection therewith deemed 
in the nature of interest under applicable Requirements of Law, shall not 
exceed the Highest Lawful Rate. If the rate of interest (determined without 
regard to the preceding sentence) under this Agreement at any time exceeds 
the Highest Lawful Rate, the outstanding amount of the Loans made hereunder 
shall bear interest at the Highest Lawful Rate until the total amount of 
interest due hereunder equals the amount of interest which would have been 
due hereunder if the stated rates of interest set forth in this Agreement 
had at all times been in effect. In addition, if when the Loans made 
hereunder are repaid in full the total interest due hereunder (taking into 
account the increase provided for above) is less than the total amount of 
interest which would have been due hereunder if the stated rates of 
interest set forth in this Agreement had at all times been in effect, then 
to the extent permitted by law, the Borrower shall pay to Administrative 
Agent an amount equal to the difference between the amount of interest paid 
and the amount of interest which would have been paid if the Highest Lawful 
Rate had at all times been in effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is 
the intention of the Lenders and the Borrower to conform strictly to any 
applicable usury laws. Accordingly, if any Lender contracts for, charges, 
or receives any consideration which constitutes interest in excess of the 
Highest Lawful Rate, then any such excess shall be cancelled automatically 
and, if previously paid, shall at such Lenders option be applied to the 
outstanding amount of the Loans made hereunder or be refunded to the 
Borrower.

SECTION 9.11 [Reserved].

SECTION 9.12 Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the other Loan Documents 
represent the entire agreement of the parties hereto with respect to the 
subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede any and all previous 
agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject 
matter hereof and thereof. There are no promises, undertakings, 
representations or warranties by the Arranger, any Agent or any Lender 
relative to the subject matter hereof not expressly set forth or referred 
to herein or in the other Loan Documents.

SECTION 9.13 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY 
WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY 
HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY 
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR 
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, 
TORT
 
-164-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO 
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PERSON HAS REPRESENTED, 
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PERSON WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF 
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT 
IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS 
AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL 
WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

SECTION 9.14 Severability. In the event any one or more of the provisions 
contained in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document should be held 
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the validity, legality 
and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein and therein 
shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. The parties shall 
endeavor in good-faith negotiations to replace the invalid, illegal or 
unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which 
comes as close as possible to that of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable 
provisions. Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this Section 9.14
, if and to the extent that the enforceability of any provisions in this 
Agreement relating to Defaulting Lenders shall be limited by Debtor Relief 
Laws, as determined in good faith by the Administrative Agent, any Issuing 
Bank or the Swingline Lender, as applicable, then such provisions shall be 
deemed to be in effect only to the extent not so limited.

SECTION 9.15 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more 
counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original but all of which, 
when taken together, shall constitute but one contract, and shall become 
effective as provided in Section 9.03. Delivery of an executed counterpart 
to this Agreement by facsimile (or other electronic) transmission pursuant 
to procedures approved by the Administrative Agent shall be as effective as 
delivery of a manually signed original.

SECTION 9.16 Headings. Article and Section headings and the Table of 
Contents used herein are for convenience of reference only, are not part of 
this Agreement and are not to affect the construction of, or to be taken 
into consideration in interpreting, this Agreement.

SECTION 9.17 Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process. (a) Each of the 
parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself 
and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of any New York State court 
or federal court of the United States of America sitting in New York City, 
and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding 
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, 
or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties 
hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in 
respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in 
such New York State or, to the extent permitted by law, in such federal 
court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such 
action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other 
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by 
law. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect any right that any Lender or 
any Issuing Bank may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding 
relating to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents against Holdings, 
the Borrower or any other Loan Party or their properties in the courts of 
any jurisdiction.
 
-165-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(b) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally 
waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any 
objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any 
suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or 
the other Loan Documents in any New York State or federal court. Each of 
the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent 
permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance 
of such action or proceeding in any such court.

SECTION 9.18 Confidentiality. Each of the Lenders, each Issuing Bank and 
each of the Agents agrees that it shall maintain in confidence any 
information relating to Holdings, the Borrower and the other Loan Parties 
furnished to it by or on behalf of Holdings, the Borrower or the other Loan 
Parties (other than information that (a) has become generally available to 
the public other than as a result of a disclosure by such party, (b) has 
been independently developed by such Lender, such Issuing Bank or such 
Agent without violating this Section 9.18 or (c) was available to such 
Lender, such Issuing Bank or such Agent from a third party having, to such 
persons knowledge, no obligations of confidentiality to Holdings, the 
Borrower or any other Loan Party) and shall not reveal the same other than 
to its directors, trustees, officers, employees and advisors with a need to 
know or to any person that approves or administers the Loans on behalf of 
such Lender (so long as each such person shall have been instructed to keep 
the same confidential in accordance with this Section 9.18), except: (a) to 
the extent necessary to comply with law or any legal process or the 
requirements of any Governmental Authority, the National Association of 
Insurance Commissioners or of any securities exchange on which securities 
of the disclosing party or any Affiliate of the disclosing party are listed 
or traded, (b) as part of normal reporting or review procedures to 
Governmental Authorities or the National Association of Insurance 
Commissioners, (c) to its Affiliates and to its and its Affiliates 
respective partners, directors, officers, employees, agents, trustees, 
advisors and representatives (so long as each such person shall have been 
instructed to keep the same confidential in accordance with this Section 
9.18), (d) in order to enforce its rights under any Loan Document in a 
legal proceeding, (e) to any prospective assignee of, or prospective 
Participant in, any of its rights under this Agreement (so long as such 
person shall have been instructed to keep the same confidential in 
accordance with this Section 9.18), (f) to any direct or indirect 
contractual counterparty in Swap Agreements or such contractual 
counterpartys professional advisor (so long as such contractual 
counterparty or professional advisor to such contractual counterparty 
agrees to be bound by the provisions of this Section) or (g) in connection 
with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or under any other Loan 
Document or any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any 
other Loan Document or the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder.

SECTION 9.19 Direct Website Communications.

(a) Delivery. (i) Each Loan Party hereby agrees that it will provide to the 
Administrative Agent all information, documents and other materials that it 
is obligated to furnish to the Administrative Agent pursuant to this 
Agreement and any other Loan Document, including all notices, requests, 
financial statements, financial and other reports, certificates and other 
information materials, but excluding any such communication that (a) 
relates to a request for a new, or a conversion of an existing, borrowing 
or other extension of credit (including any
 
-166-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
election of an interest rate or interest period relating thereto), (b) 
relates to the payment of any principal or other amount due under this 
Agreement prior to the scheduled date therefor, (c) provides notice of any 
Default or Event of Default under this Agreement or (d) is required to be 
delivered to satisfy any condition precedent to the effectiveness of this 
Agreement and/or any borrowing or other extension of credit hereunder (all 
such non-excluded communications collectively, the Communications), by 
transmitting the Communications in an electronic/soft medium in a format 
acceptable to the Administrative Agent. In addition, each Loan Party agrees 
to continue to provide the Communications to the Administrative Agent in 
the manner specified in this Agreement or any other Loan Document but only 
to the extent requested by the Administrative Agent. Nothing in this 
Section 9.19 shall prejudice the right of the Agents, the Lead Arranger or 
any Lender or any Loan Party to give any notice or other communication 
pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document in any other manner 
specified in this Agreement or any other Loan Document.

(ii) The Administrative Agent agrees that receipt of the Communications by 
the Administrative Agent at its e-mail address set forth in Section 9.01 
shall constitute effective delivery of the Communications to the 
Administrative Agent for purposes of the Loan Documents. Each Lender agrees 
that notice to it (as provided in the next sentence) specifying that the 
Communications have been posted to the Platform (as defined below) shall 
constitute effective delivery of the Communications to such Lender for 
purposes of the Loan Documents. Each Lender agrees (a) to notify the 
Administrative Agent in writing (including by electronic communication) 
from time to time of such Lenders e-mail address to which the foregoing 
notice may be sent by electronic transmission and (b) that the foregoing 
notice may be sent to such e-mail address.

(b) Posting. The Borrower hereby acknowledges that (a) the Administrative 
Agent and/or the Arranger will make the Communications available to the 
Lenders and each Issuing Bank by posting the Communications on IntraLinks 
or another similar electronic system (the Platform) and (b) certain of 
the Lenders (each, a Public Lender) may have personnel who do not wish to 
receive material non-public information with respect to the Borrower or its 
Affiliates, or the respective securities of any of the foregoing, and who 
may be engaged in investment and other market-related activities with 
respect to such persons securities. The Borrower hereby agrees that it 
will use commercially reasonable efforts to identify that portion of the 
Communications that may be distributed to the Public Lenders and that (w) 
all such Communications shall be clearly and conspicuously marked PUBLIC 
which, at a minimum, shall mean that the word PUBLIC shall appear 
prominently on the first page thereof; (x) by marking Communications 
PUBLIC, the Borrower shall be deemed to have authorized the 
Administrative Agent, the Arranger, each Issuing Bank and the Lenders to 
treat such Communications as not containing any material non-public 
information (although it may be sensitive and proprietary) with respect to 
the Borrower or its securities for purposes of United States Federal and 
state securities laws (provided, however, that to the extent such 
Communications constitute Information, they shall be treated as set forth 
in Section 9.18); (y) all Communications marked PUBLIC are permitted to 
be made available through a portion of the Platform designated Public Side 
Information; and (z) the Administrative Agent and the Arranger shall be 
entitled to treat any Communications that are not marked PUBLIC as being 
suitable only for posting on a portion of the Platform not designated 
Public Side Information.
 
-167-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(c) Platform. THE PLATFORM IS PROVIDED AS IS AND AS AVAILABLE. THE 
AGENT PARTIES (AS DEFINED BELOW) DO NOT WARRANT THE ACCURACY OR 
COMPLETENESS OF THE COMMUNICATIONS OR THE ADEQUACY OF THE PLATFORM, AND 
EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM LIABILITY FOR ERRORS IN OR OMISSIONS FROM THE 
COMMUNICATIONS. NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, 
INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR 
PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS OR FREEDOM FROM VIRUSES OR 
OTHER CODE DEFECTS, IS MADE BY ANY AGENT PARTY IN CONNECTION WITH THE 
COMMUNICATIONS OR THE PLATFORM. In no event shall the Administrative Agent 
or any of its Related Parties (collectively, the Agent Parties) have any 
liability to the Borrower, any Lender, any Issuing Bank or any other person 
for losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses of any kind (whether 
in tort, contract or otherwise) arising out of the Borrowers or the 
Administrative Agents transmission of Communications through the Internet, 
except to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or 
expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by a final and 
nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or 
willful misconduct of such Agent Party; provided, however, that in no event 
shall any Agent Party have any liability to the Borrower, any Lender, any 
Issuing Bank or any other person for indirect, special, incidental, 
consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages).

SECTION 9.20 Release of Liens and Guarantees. In the event that any Loan 
Party conveys, sells, leases, assigns, transfers or otherwise disposes of 
all or any portion of any of the Equity Interests or assets of any Loan 
Party (other than the Equity Interests of the Borrower) to a person that is 
not (and is not required to become) a Loan Party in a transaction permitted 
by this Agreement, then the Administrative Agent shall promptly (and the 
Lenders hereby authorize the Administrative Agent to) take such action and 
execute any such documents as may be reasonably requested by Holdings or 
the Borrower and at the Borrowers expense to release any Liens created by 
any Loan Document in respect of such assets or Equity interests, and, in 
the case of a disposition of the Equity Interests of any Loan Party in a 
transaction permitted by this Agreement and as a result of which such Loan 
Party would cease to be a Subsidiary, terminate such Loan Partys 
obligations under the Guaranty Agreement, Collateral Agreement and any 
other applicable Security Document. In addition, the Administrative Agent 
agrees to take such actions as are reasonably requested by Holdings or the 
Borrower and at the Borrowers expense to terminate the Liens and security 
interests created by the Loan Documents when all the Obligations (other 
than contingent indemnities and expense reimbursement obligations to the 
extent no claim therefor has been made) are paid in full and all Letters of 
Credit and Commitments are terminated. Any representation, warranty or 
covenant contained in any Loan Document relating to any such Equity 
Interests, asset or subsidiary of the Borrower shall no longer be deemed to 
be made once such Equity Interests or asset or subsidiary is so conveyed, 
sold, leased, assigned, transferred or disposed of.

SECTION 9.21 Power of Attorney. Each Lender (including the Swingline 
Lender) and each Issuing Bank hereby (i) authorizes the Administrative 
Agent as its agent and attorney-in-fact to execute and deliver, on behalf 
of and in the name of such Lender or Issuing Bank (or Affiliate), all and 
any Loan Documents (including Security Documents) and related 
documentation, (ii) authorizes the Administrative Agent to appoint any 
further agents or
 
-168-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
attorneys-in-fact to execute and deliver, or otherwise to act, on behalf of 
and in the name of the Administrative Agent for any such purpose and (iii) 
authorizes the Administrative Agent to delegate its powers under this power 
of attorney and to do any and all acts and to make and receive all 
declarations that are deemed necessary or appropriate to the Administrative 
Agent.

SECTION 9.22 PATRIOT Act Notice. Each Lender, each Issuing Bank, the 
Administrative Agent (for itself and not on behalf of any Lender) and the 
Collateral Agent hereby notifies each Loan Party that pursuant to the 
requirements of the PATRIOT Act, it is required to obtain, verify and 
record information that identifies the Loan Parties, which information 
includes the name, address and taxpayer information number of each Loan 
Party and other information that will allow such Lender, such Issuing Bank, 
the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, to 
identify such Loan Party in accordance with the PATRIOT Act. The Borrower 
shall, promptly following a request by any Lender, any Issuing Bank, the 
Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, provide all documentation and 
other information that such Lender, such Issuing Bank, the Administrative 
Agent or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, reasonably requests in order 
to comply with its ongoing obligations under applicable know your 
customer and anti-money-laundering rules and regulations, including the 
PATRIOT Act.

SECTION 9.23 No Advisory or Fiduciary Relationship. In connection with all 
aspects of each transaction contemplated hereby (including in connection 
with any amendment, waiver or other modification hereof or of any other 
Loan Document), the Borrower acknowledges and agrees that: (i) (A) the 
arranging and other services regarding this Agreement provided by the 
Administrative Agent, the Lead Arranger, and the other Agents are 
arms-length commercial transactions between the Borrower and its 
Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Administrative Agent, the Arranger, 
and the other Agents, on the other hand, (B) the Borrower has consulted its 
own legal, accounting, regulatory and tax advisors to the extent it has 
deemed appropriate, and (C) the Borrower is capable of evaluating, and 
understands and accepts, the terms, risks and conditions of the 
transactions contemplated hereby and by the other Loan Documents; (ii) (A) 
the Administrative Agent, the Lead Arranger, and the other Agents each is 
and has been acting solely as a principal and, except as expressly agreed 
in writing by the relevant parties, has not been, is not, and will not be 
acting as an advisor, agent or fiduciary for the Borrower or any of its 
Affiliates, or any other person and (B) neither the Administrative Agent, 
the Lead Arranger, nor any of the other Agents has any obligation to the 
Borrower or any of its Affiliates with respect to the transactions 
contemplated hereby except those obligations expressly set forth herein and 
in the other Loan Documents; and (iii) the Administrative Agent, the Lead 
Arranger, and the other Agents and their respective Affiliates may be 
engaged in a broad range of transactions that involve interests that differ 
from those of the Borrower and its Affiliates, and neither the 
Administrative Agent, the Lead Arranger, nor any of the other Agents has 
any obligation to disclose any of such interests to the Borrower or its 
Affiliates. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Borrower hereby 
waives and releases any claims that it may have against the Administrative 
Agent, the Lead Arranger, and the other Agents with respect to any breach 
or alleged breach of agency or fiduciary duty in connection with any aspect 
of any transaction contemplated hereby.

SECTION 9.24 Acknowledgement and Consent to Bail-In of EEA Financial 
Institutions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Loan Document 
or in any other agreement, arrangement or understanding among any such 
parties, each party hereto acknowledges that any liability of any EEA 
Financial Institution arising under any Loan Document, to the extent such 
liability is unsecured, may be subject to the write-down and conversion 
powers of an EEA Resolution Authority and agrees and consents to, and 
acknowledges and agrees to be bound by:

ownership will be accepted by it in lieu of any rights with respect to any 
such liability under this Agreement or any other Loan Document; or

(iii) the variation of the terms of such liability in connection with the 
exercise of the write-down and conversion powers of any EEA Resolution 
Authority.

terms of this Agreement relating to the Pledged Equity Interests issued by 
it and will comply with such terms insofar as such terms are applicable to 
it, (ii) it will notify the Agent promptly in writing of the occurrence of 
any of the events described in Section 4.6(a) with respect to the Pledged 
Equity Interests issued by it and (iii) the terms of Sections 4.7(c) shall 
apply to it, mutatis mutandis, with respect to all actions that may be 
required of it pursuant to Section 4.7(c) with respect to the Pledged 
Equity Interests issued by it. In addition, each Grantor which is either an 
Issuer or an owner of any Pledged Equity Interests hereby consents to the 
grant by each other Grantor of the security interest hereunder in favor of 
the Agent and to the transfer of any Pledged Equity Interest to the Agent 
or its nominee following an Event of Default and to the substitution of the 
Agent or its nominee as a partner, member or shareholder or other equity 
holder of the Issuer of the related Pledged Equity Interest.

4.7. Voting and Other Rights with Respect to Pledged Securities. (a) Unless 
an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Grantor 
shall be permitted to receive all cash dividends paid in respect of the 
Pledged Equity Interests and all payments made in respect of the Pledged 
Notes or Pledged Debt Securities, in each case paid in the normal course of 
business of the relevant Issuer, to the extent permitted by the Credit 
Agreement, and to exercise all voting and corporate rights with respect to 
the Pledged Equity Interests; provided, however, that no vote shall be cast 
or corporate or other ownership right exercised or other action taken which 
would result in any violation of any provision of the Credit Agreement, 
this Agreement or any other Loan Document.

(b) If an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing: (i) all rights of 
each Grantor to exercise or refrain from exercising the voting and other 
consensual rights with respect to Pledged Securities which it would 
otherwise be entitled to exercise shall cease and all such rights shall 
thereupon become vested in the Agent who shall thereupon have the sole 
right, but shall be under no obligation, to exercise or refrain from 
exercising such voting and other consensual rights and (ii) the Agent shall 
have the right, without notice to any Grantor, to transfer all or any 
portion of the Pledged Securities to its name or the name of its nominee or 
agent. In addition, the Agent shall have the right at any time, without 
notice to any Grantor, to exchange any certificates or instruments 
representing any Pledged Securities for certificates or instruments of 
smaller or larger denominations. In order to permit the Agent to exercise 
the voting and other consensual rights which it may be entitled to exercise 
pursuant hereto and to receive all dividends and other distributions which 
it may be entitled to receive hereunder each Grantor shall promptly execute 
and deliver (or cause to be executed and delivered) to the Agent all 
proxies, dividend payment orders and other instruments as the Agent may 
from time to time reasonably request and each Grantor acknowledges that the 
Agent may utilize the power of attorney set forth herein.
 
21

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(c) Each Grantor hereby authorizes and instructs each Issuer of any Pledged 
Securities pledged by such Grantor hereunder to (i) comply with any 
instruction received by it from the Agent in writing that (x) states that 
an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and (y) is otherwise in 
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, without any other or further 
instructions from such Grantor, and each Grantor agrees that each Issuer 
shall be fully protected in so complying, and (ii) unless otherwise 
expressly permitted hereby, pay any dividends or other payments with 
respect to the Pledged Securities directly to the Agent.

4.8. Receivables. Other than in the ordinary course of business consistent 
with its past practice or to the extent any such actions would not 
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, such Grantor will 
not (i) grant any extension of the time of payment of any Receivable, (ii) 
compromise or settle any Receivable for less than the full amount thereof, 
(iii) release, wholly or partially, any Person liable for the payment of 
any Receivable, (iv) allow any credit or discount whatsoever on any 
Receivable or (v) amend, supplement or modify any Receivable in any manner 
that could adversely affect the value thereof; provided that, a Grantor 
shall not take any of the foregoing actions to the extent an Event of 
Default has occurred and is continuing.

4.9. Intellectual Property. (a) Such Grantor will not, without the prior 
written consent of the Agent, do any act or omit to do any act whereby any 
Material Intellectual Property may lapse, become abandoned, cancelled, 
dedicated to the public, forfeited, or otherwise impaired.

(b) Such Grantor shall take all reasonable steps, including in any 
proceeding before the United States Patent and Trademark Office, the United 
States Copyright Office, any state registry or any foreign counterpart of 
the foregoing, to pursue any application and maintain any registration or 
issuance of each Trademark, Patent, and Copyright owned by or exclusively 
licensed to such Grantor and constituting Material Intellectual Property.

(c) Such Grantor agrees that, should it hereafter (i) obtain an ownership 
interest in any item of Intellectual Property, (ii) obtain an exclusive 
license to any Copyrights, (iii) (either by itself or through any agent, 
employee, licensee, or designee) file any application for the registration 
or issuance of any Intellectual Property with the United States Patent and 
Trademark Office, the United States Copyright Office, or any similar office 
or agency in any other country or in any political subdivision of any of 
the foregoing, or (iv) should it file a Statement of Use or an Amendment to 
Allege Use with respect to any intent-to-use Trademark application (the 
items in clauses (i), (ii) (iii) and (iv), collectively, the 
After-Acquired Intellectual Property), then the provisions of Section 2 
shall automatically apply thereto, and any such After-Acquired Intellectual 
Property shall automatically become part of the Collateral, and such 
Grantor shall give prompt written notice thereof to the Agent in accordance 
herewith, and shall provide the Agent with an amended Schedule 7 hereto, in 
each case, concurrently with the delivery of each of the quarterly 
financials (or Quarterly Reports) delivered pursuant to Section 5.04(b) of 
the Credit Agreement, and promptly take the actions specified in Section 
4.9(d) with respect thereto.
 
22

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(d) Such Grantor shall execute Intellectual Property Security Agreements 
with respect to the Intellectual Property included in the Collateral as of 
the date hereof, as well as any After-Acquired Intellectual Property, in 
substantially the form of Exhibits C-1, C-2, or C-3, as applicable, in 
order to record the security interest granted herein to the Agent for the 
benefit of the Secured Parties with the United States Patent and Trademark 
Office or the United States Copyright Office, as applicable, and such 
Grantor shall promptly execute and deliver, and have recorded, any and all 
other agreements, instruments, documents, and papers as the Agent may 
reasonably request to evidence the Secured Parties security interest in 
any such Intellectual Property with any other applicable offices, agencies, 
or Governmental Authorities, subject to the Agreed Security Principles.

(e) Such Grantor shall use commercially reasonable efforts so as not to 
permit the inclusion in any contract to which it hereafter becomes a party 
of any provision that could or may in any way materially impair or prevent 
the creation of a security interest in, or the assignment of, such 
Grantors rights and interests in any property that constitutes Material 
Intellectual Property.

(f) Such Grantor shall promptly notify the Agent if it knows or has reason 
to know that any item of Material Intellectual Property may become (i) 
abandoned or dedicated to the public or placed in the public domain, (ii) 
invalid or unenforceable, (iii) subject to any adverse determination or 
development regarding such Grantors ownership, registration or use or the 
validity or enforceability of such item of Intellectual Property (including 
the institution of, or any adverse development with respect to, any action 
or proceeding in the United States Patent and Trademark Office, the United 
States Copyright Office, any state registry, any foreign counterpart of the 
foregoing, or any court) or (iv) the subject of any reversion or 
termination rights.

(g) In the event that any Material Intellectual Property owned by or 
exclusively licensed to any Grantor is infringed, misappropriated, diluted 
or otherwise violated by another Person, such Grantor shall (i) promptly 
take all reasonable actions to stop such infringement, misappropriation, 
dilution or other violation and protect its rights in such Material 
Intellectual Property including, but not limited to, the initiation of a 
suit for injunctive relief and to recover damages, and (ii) promptly notify 
the Agent after it learns thereof.

4.10. [Reserved].

4.11. Government Receivables. If any Grantor shall at any time after the 
date of this Agreement acquire or become the beneficiary of Receivables in 
excess of $5,000,000 in the aggregate in respect of which the account 
debtor is a Governmental Authority, such Grantor shall promptly notify the 
Agent and, upon the reasonable request of the Agent, shall take any 
necessary steps to perfect the Lien of the Agent for the benefit of the 
Secured Parties therein, and make such Lien enforceable against the account 
debtor.
 
23

------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.12. Letter of Credit Rights. Within thirty (30) days after the date of 
obtaining any letter of credit rights other than in respect of the letters 
of credit described on Schedule 9 hereto, each Grantor shall provide the 
Agent with an amended or supplemented Schedule 9 to reflect such additional 
letters of credit.

4.13. Commercial Tort Claims. Within thirty (30) days after the date of any 
additional material commercial tort claims arising since Schedule 10 was 
last delivered, each Grantor shall provide the Agent with an amended or 
supplemented Schedule 10 to reflect such additional commercial tort claims.


SECTION 5. REMEDIAL PROVISIONS

5.1. Certain Matters Relating to Receivables. (a) [Reserved].

(b) The Agent hereby authorizes each Grantor to collect such Grantors 
Receivables and each Grantor hereby agrees to continue to collect all 
amounts due or to become due to such Grantor under the Receivables and any 
Supporting Obligation in respect thereof and diligently exercise each 
material right it may have under any Receivable and any such Supporting 
Obligation, in each case, at its own expense consistent with its reasonable 
business judgment; provided, however, that the Agent may curtail or 
terminate said authority at any time after the occurrence and during the 
continuance of an Event of Default. If required by the Agent at any time 
after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, any 
payments of Receivables, when collected by any Grantor, (i) shall forthwith 
(and, in any event, within two (2) Business Days) be deposited by such 
Grantor in the exact form received, duly endorsed by such Grantor to the 
Agent if required, in a Collateral Account maintained under the sole 
dominion and control of the Agent, subject to withdrawal by the Agent for 
the account of the Secured Parties only as provided in Section 5.4, and 
(ii) until so turned over, shall be held by such Grantor in trust for the 
Secured Parties, segregated from other funds of such Grantor. Each such 
deposit of Proceeds of Receivables shall be accompanied by a report 
identifying in reasonable detail the nature and source of the payments 
included in the deposit.

(c) If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, at the Agents 
request, each Grantor shall deliver to the Agent all original and other 
documents evidencing, and relating to, the agreements and transactions 
which gave rise to the Receivables, including, without limitation, all 
original orders, invoices and shipping receipts.

5.2. Communications with Obligors. (a) The Agent in its own name or in the 
name of others may at any time after the occurrence and during the 
continuance of an Event of Default communicate with obligors under the 
Receivables to verify with them to the Agents satisfaction the existence, 
amount and terms of any Receivables.

(b) After the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, 
the Agent may upon written notice to the applicable Grantor, notify, or 
require any Grantor to notify, the Account Debtor or counterparty to make 
all payments under the Receivable directly to the Agent.
 
24

------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.3. Proceeds to be Turned Over To Agent. In addition to the rights of the 
Secured Parties specified in Section 5.1 with respect to payments of 
Receivables, if an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing and upon 
Agents written request, all Proceeds received by any Grantor consisting of 
cash, Cash Equivalents, checks and other near-cash items shall be held by 
such Grantor in trust for the Secured Parties, segregated from other funds 
of such Grantor, and shall, forthwith upon receipt by such Grantor, be 
turned over to the Agent in the exact form received by such Grantor (duly 
endorsed by such Grantor to the Agent, if required). All Proceeds received 
by the Agent hereunder shall be held by the Agent in a Collateral Account 
maintained under its sole dominion and control. All Proceeds while held by 
the Agent in a Collateral Account (or by such Grantor in trust for the 
Secured Parties) shall continue to be held as collateral security for all 
the Secured Obligations and shall not constitute payment thereof until 
applied as provided in Section 5.4.

5.4. Application of Proceeds. (a) Subject to Section 5.4(b) below, if an 
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, at any time at the 
Agents election, the Agent may (and, if directed by the Required Lenders, 
shall), notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.08 and Section 2.11 of 
the Credit Agreement, apply all or any part of the Collateral and/or net 
Proceeds thereof (after deducting fees and expenses as provided in Section 
5.5) realized through the exercise by the Agent of its remedies hereunder, 
whether or not held in any Collateral Account, in payment of the Secured 
Obligations. The Agent shall apply any such Collateral or Proceeds to be 
applied in the following order:

First, to the Agent and the Administrative Agent to pay incurred and unpaid 
fees and expenses under the Loan Documents;

Second, to the Administrative Agent in respect of Secured Obligations then 
due and owing and remaining unpaid for application by the Administrative 
Agent in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement;

Third, to the Administrative Agent in respect of all Secured Obligations, 
(other than those under clause second above) for prepayment of such Secured 
Obligations in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement; and

Fourth, any balance of such Proceeds remaining after a Discharge of the 
Secured Obligations shall be paid over to the Borrower or to whomsoever may 
be lawfully entitled to receive the same and any Collateral remaining after 
a Discharge of Secured Obligations shall be returned to the applicable 
Grantor or to whomsoever may be lawfully entitled to receive the same.

In addition, with respect to any proceeds of Insurance received by the 
Agent, (x) if no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, 
(i) such Insurance Proceeds shall be returned to the Grantors if permitted 
or required by the Credit Agreement or (ii) if not so permitted or required 
by the Credit Agreement, then such Insurance Proceeds shall be applied in 
accordance with this Section 5.4(a) and (y) if an Event of Default shall 
have occurred and be continuing, then such Insurance Proceeds shall be 
applied in accordance with this Section 5.4(a).
 
25

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Letters of Credit 
issued by an Issuing Bank, if such Issuing Bank, or the Agent on behalf of 
such Issuing Bank, shall have received any Collateral to cash 
collateralize any such Letter of Credit, all such Collateral shall first 
be applied to satisfy any reimbursement obligations and other obligations 
owing to the Issuing Bank in respect of such Letter of Credit before it may 
be applied as set forth in Section 5.4(a).

5.5. Code and Other Remedies. (a) If an Event of Default shall occur and be 
continuing, the Agent, on behalf of the Secured Parties, may exercise, in 
addition to all other rights and remedies granted to them in this Agreement 
and in any other instrument or agreement securing, evidencing or relating 
to the Secured Obligations, all rights and remedies of a secured party 
under the UCC (whether or not the UCC applies to the affected Collateral) 
and all rights under any other applicable law or in equity. Without 
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Agent, without demand of 
performance or other demand, defense, presentment, protest, advertisement 
or notice of any kind (except any notice required by law referred to below) 
to or upon any Grantor or any other Person (all and each of which demands, 
presentments, protests, defenses, advertisements and notices are hereby 
waived), may in such circumstances forthwith collect, receive, appropriate 
and realize upon the Collateral, or any part thereof, and/or may forthwith 
sell, lease, license, assign, give option or options to purchase, or 
otherwise dispose of and deliver the Collateral or any part thereof (or 
contract to do any of the foregoing), in one or more parcels at public or 
private sale or sales, at any exchange, brokers board or office of any 
Secured Party, on the internet or elsewhere upon such terms and conditions 
as it may deem advisable and at such prices as it may deem best, for cash 
or on credit or for future delivery without assumption of any credit risk. 
So long as an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the 
Agent may store, repair or recondition any Collateral or otherwise prepare 
any Collateral for disposal in the manner and to the extent that the Agent 
deems appropriate. Each Secured Party shall have the right upon any such 
public sale or sales, and, to the extent permitted by law, upon any such 
private sale or sales, to purchase the whole or any part of the Collateral 
so sold or to become the licensor of all or any such Collateral, free of 
any right or equity of redemption in any Grantor, which right or equity is 
hereby waived and released. For purposes of bidding and making settlement 
or payment of the purchase price for all or a portion of the Collateral 
sold at any such sale made in accordance with the UCC or other applicable 
laws, including, without limitation, the Bankruptcy Code, the Agent, as 
agent for and representative of the Secured Parties (but not any Secured 
Party or Secured Parties in its or their respective individual capacities 
unless the Required Lenders shall otherwise agree in writing), shall be 
entitled to credit bid and use and apply the Secured Obligations (or any 
portion thereof) as a credit on account of the purchase price for any 
Collateral payable by the Agent at such sale, such amount to be apportioned 
ratably to the Secured Obligations of the Secured Parties in accordance 
with their pro rata share of such Secured Obligations. Each purchaser at 
any such sale shall hold the property sold absolutely free from any claim 
or right on the part of any Grantor, and each Grantor hereby waives (to the 
extent permitted by applicable law) all rights of redemption, stay and/or 
appraisal which it now has or may at any time in the future have under any 
rule of law or statute now existing or hereafter enacted. Each Grantor 
agrees that, to the extent notice of sale shall be required by law, at 
least ten (10) days notice to such Grantor of the time and place of any 
public sale or the time after which any private sale is to be made shall 
constitute reasonable
 
26

------------------------------------------------------------------------
notification. The Agent shall not be obligated to make any sale of 
Collateral regardless of notice of sale having been given. The Agent may 
adjourn any public or private sale from time to time by announcement at the 
time and place fixed therefor, and such sale may, without further notice, 
be made at the time and place to which it was so adjourned. The Agent may 
sell the Collateral without giving any warranties as to the Collateral. The 
Agent may specifically disclaim or modify any warranties of title or the 
like. The foregoing will not be considered to adversely affect the 
commercial reasonableness of any sale of the Collateral. Each Grantor 
agrees that it would not be commercially unreasonable for the Agent to 
dispose of the Collateral or any portion thereof by using Internet sites 
that provide for the auction of assets of the types included in the 
Collateral or that have the reasonable capability of doing so, or that 
match buyers and sellers of assets. Each Grantor hereby waives any claims 
against the Agent arising by reason of the fact that the price at which any 
Collateral may have been sold at such a private sale was less than the 
price which might have been obtained at a public sale, even if the Agent 
accepts the first offer received and does not offer such Collateral to more 
than one offeree. Each Grantor further agrees, at the Agents request, to 
assemble the Collateral and make it available to the Agent at places which 
the Agent shall reasonably select, whether at such Grantors premises or 
elsewhere. The Agent shall have the right to enter onto the property where 
any Collateral is located without any obligation to pay rent and take 
possession thereof with or without judicial process. The Agent shall have 
no obligation to marshal any of the Collateral.

(b) The Agent shall deduct from such Proceeds all reasonable costs and 
expenses of every kind incurred in connection with the exercise of its 
rights and remedies against the Collateral or incidental to the care or 
safekeeping of any of the Collateral or in any way relating to the 
Collateral or the rights of the Secured Parties hereunder, including, 
without limitation, reasonable and documented attorneys fees and 
disbursements. Any net Proceeds remaining after such deductions shall be 
applied or retained by the Agent in accordance with Section 5.4. Only after 
such application and after the payment by the Agent of any other amount 
required by any provision of law, including, without limitation, Section 
9-615(a) of the UCC, need the Agent account for the surplus, if any, to any 
Grantor. If the Agent sells any of the Collateral upon credit, the Grantor 
will be credited only with payments actually made by the purchaser and 
received by the Agent. In the event the purchaser fails to pay for the 
Collateral, the Agent may resell the Collateral and the applicable Grantor 
shall be credited with proceeds of the sale. To the extent permitted by 
applicable law, each Grantor waives all claims, damages and demands it may 
acquire against any Secured Party arising out of the exercise by it or them 
of any rights hereunder.

(c) In the event of any Disposition of any of the Intellectual Property, 
the goodwill of the business connected with and symbolized by any 
Trademarks subject to such Disposition shall be included, and the 
applicable Grantor shall supply the Agent or its designee with such 
Grantors know-how and expertise, and with documents and things embodying 
the same, relating to the exploitation of such Intellectual Property, 
including the manufacture, distribution, advertising and sale of products 
or the provision of services under such Intellectual Property, and such 
Grantors customer lists and other records and documents relating to such 
Intellectual Property and to the manufacture, distribution, advertising and 
sale of such products and services.
 
27

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(d) For the purpose of enabling the Agent to exercise rights and remedies 
under this Section 5.5 (including in order to take possession of, collect, 
receive, assemble, process, appropriate, remove, realize upon, sell, 
assign, license out, convey, transfer or grant options to purchase any 
Collateral) at such time as the Agent shall be lawfully entitled to 
exercise such rights and remedies, each Grantor hereby grants to the Agent, 
for the benefit of the Secured Parties, (i) an irrevocable, nonexclusive, 
and assignable license (exercisable without payment of royalty or other 
compensation to such Grantor), subject, in the case of Trademarks, to 
sufficient rights to quality control and inspection in favor of such 
Grantor to avoid the risk of invalidation of such Trademarks, to use, 
practice, license, sublicense, and otherwise exploit any and all 
Intellectual Property now owned or held or hereafter acquired or held by 
such Grantor (which license shall include access to all media in which any 
of the licensed items may be recorded or stored and to all software and 
programs used for the compilation or printout thereof) and (ii) an 
irrevocable license (without payment of rent or other compensation to such 
Grantor) to use, operate and occupy all real property owned, operated, 
leased, subleased, or otherwise occupied by such Grantor.

5.6. Effect of Securities Laws. Each Grantor recognizes that the Agent may 
be unable to effect a public sale of any or all of the Pledged Equity 
Interests or the Pledged Debt Securities by reason of certain prohibitions 
contained in the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws or 
otherwise, and may be compelled to resort to one or more private sales 
thereof to a restricted group of purchasers which will be obliged to agree, 
among other things, to acquire such securities for their own account for 
investment and not with a view to the distribution or resale thereof. Each 
Grantor acknowledges and agrees that any such private sale may result in 
prices and other terms less favorable than if such sale were a public sale 
and, notwithstanding such circumstances, agrees that any such private sale 
shall be deemed to have been made in a commercially reasonable manner. The 
Agent shall be under no obligation to delay a sale of any of the Pledged 
Equity Interests or the Pledged Debt Securities for the period of time 
necessary to permit the Issuer thereof to register such securities for 
public sale under the Securities Act, or under applicable state securities 
laws, even if such Issuer would agree to do so.

5.7. Deficiency. Each Grantor shall remain liable for any deficiency if the 
proceeds of any sale or other disposition of the Collateral are 
insufficient to pay its Secured Obligations and the fees and disbursements 
of any attorneys employed by any Secured Party to collect such deficiency.


SECTION 6. POWER OF ATTORNEY

6.1. Agents Appointment as Attorney-in-Fact, Etc. (a) Each Grantor hereby 
irrevocably constitutes and appoints the Agent and any officer or agent 
thereof, with full power of substitution, as its true and lawful 
attorney-in-fact with full irrevocable power and authority in the place and 
stead of such Grantor and in the name of such Grantor or in its own name, 
for the purpose of carrying out the terms of this Agreement, to take any 
and all appropriate action and to execute any and all documents and 
instruments which may be necessary or desirable to accomplish the purposes 
of this Agreement, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
 
28

------------------------------------------------------------------------
each Grantor hereby gives the Agent the power and right, on behalf of such 
Grantor, without notice to or assent by such Grantor, to do any or all of 
the following:

(i) in the name of such Grantor or its own name, or otherwise, take 
possession of and endorse and collect any checks, drafts, notes, 
acceptances or other instruments for the payment of moneys due under any 
Receivable or with respect to any other Collateral and file any claim or 
take any other action or proceeding in any court of law or equity or 
otherwise deemed appropriate by the Agent for the purpose of collecting any 
and all such moneys due under any Receivable or with respect to any other 
Collateral whenever payable;

(ii) in the case of any Intellectual Property, execute and deliver, and 
have recorded, any and all agreements, instruments, documents and papers as 
the Agent may request to evidence the Secured Parties security interest in 
such Intellectual Property and the goodwill and general intangibles of such 
Grantor relating thereto or represented thereby;

(iii) pay or discharge taxes and Liens levied or placed on or threatened 
against the Collateral, effect any repairs or purchase any insurance called 
for by the terms of the Loan Documents and pay all or any part of the 
premiums therefor and the costs thereof;

(iv) execute, in connection with any sale provided for in Section 5.5 or 
5.6, any endorsements, assignments or other instruments of conveyance or 
transfer with respect to the Collateral; and

(v)(1) direct any party liable for any payment under any of the Collateral 
to make payment of any and all moneys due or to become due thereunder 
directly to the Agent or as the Agent shall direct; (2) ask or demand for, 
collect, and receive payment of and receipt for, any and all moneys, claims 
and other amounts due or to become due at any time in respect of or arising 
out of any Collateral; (3) sign and endorse any invoices, freight or 
express bills, bills of lading, storage or warehouse receipts, drafts 
against debtors, assignments, verifications, notices and other documents in 
connection with any of the Collateral; (4) commence and prosecute any 
suits, actions or proceedings at law or in equity in any court of competent 
jurisdiction to collect the Collateral or any portion thereof and to 
enforce any other right in respect of any Collateral; (5) defend any suit, 
action or proceeding brought against such Grantor with respect to any 
Collateral; (6) settle, compromise or adjust any such suit, action or 
proceeding and, in connection therewith, give such discharges or releases 
as the Agent may deem appropriate; (7) assign any Copyright, Patent or 
Trademark (along with the goodwill of the business to which any such 
Copyright, Patent or Trademark pertains), throughout the world for such 
term or terms, on such conditions, and in such manner, as the Agent shall 
in its sole discretion determine; and (8) generally, sell, transfer, pledge 
and make any agreement with respect to or otherwise deal with any of the 
Collateral as fully and completely as though the Agent were the absolute 
owner thereof for all
 
29

------------------------------------------------------------------------
purposes, and do, at the Agents option and such Grantors expense, at any 
time, or from time to time, all acts and things which the Agent deems 
necessary to protect, preserve or realize upon the Collateral and the 
Secured Parties security interests therein and to effect the intent of 
this Agreement, all as fully and effectively as such Grantor might do.

Anything in this Section 6.1(a) to the contrary notwithstanding, the Agent 
agrees that, except as provided in Section 6.1(b), it will not exercise any 
rights under the power of attorney provided for in this Section 6.1(a) 
unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing.

(b) If any Grantor fails to perform or comply with any of its agreements 
contained herein, the Agent, at its option, but without any obligation so 
to do, may perform or comply, or otherwise cause performance or compliance, 
with such agreement; provided, however, that unless an Event of Default has 
occurred and is continuing or time is of the essence, the Agent shall not 
exercise this power without first making demand on the Grantor and the 
Grantor failing to promptly comply therewith.

(c) [Reserved].

(d) Each Grantor hereby ratifies all that said attorneys shall lawfully do 
or cause to be done by virtue hereof. All powers, authorizations and 
agencies contained in this Agreement are coupled with an interest and are 
irrevocable until a Discharge of the Secured Obligations.

6.2. Authorization of Financing Statements. Each Grantor acknowledges that 
pursuant to Section 9-509(b) of the UCC and any other applicable law, the 
Agent is authorized to file or record financing or continuation statements, 
and amendments thereto, and other filing or recording documents or 
instruments with respect to the Collateral in such form and in such offices 
as the Agent reasonably determines appropriate to perfect or maintain the 
perfection of the security interests of the Agent under this Agreement. 
Each Grantor agrees that such financing statements may describe the 
collateral in the same manner as described in the Security documents or as 
all assets or all personal property of the such Grantor, whether now 
owned or hereafter existing or acquired by the such Grantor or such other 
description as the Agent, in its sole judgment, determines is necessary or 
advisable. A photographic or other reproduction of this Agreement shall be 
sufficient as a financing statement or other filing or recording document 
or instrument for filing or recording in any jurisdiction.


SECTION 7. LIEN ABSOLUTE; WAIVER OF SURETYSHIP DEFENSES

7.1. Lien Absolute, Waivers. (a) All rights of Agent hereunder, and all 
obligations of Grantors hereunder, shall be absolute and unconditional 
irrespective of, shall not be affected by, and shall remain in full force 
and effect without regard to, and hereby waives all, rights, claims or 
defenses that it might otherwise have (now or in the future) with respect 
to, in each case, each of the following (whether or not such Grantor has 
knowledge thereof):
 
30

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(i) the validity or enforceability of the Credit Agreement or any other 
Loan Document, any of the Secured Obligations or any guarantee or right of 
offset with respect thereto at any time or from time to time held by any 
Secured Party;

(ii) any renewal, extension or acceleration of, or any increase in the 
amount of the Secured Obligations, or any amendment, supplement, 
modification or waiver of, or any consent to departure from, the Loan 
Documents;

(iii) any failure or omission to assert or enforce or agreement or election 
not to assert or enforce, delay in enforcement, or the stay or enjoining, 
by order of court, by operation of law or otherwise, of the exercise or 
enforcement of, any claim or demand or any right, power or remedy (whether 
arising under any Loan Documents, at law, in equity or otherwise) with 
respect to the Secured Obligations or any agreement relating thereto, or 
with respect to any other guaranty of or security for the payment of the 
Secured Obligations;

(iv) any change, reorganization or termination of the corporate structure 
or existence of Borrower or any other Grantor or any of their Subsidiaries 
and any corresponding restructuring of the Secured Obligations;

(v) any settlement, compromise, release, or discharge of, or acceptance or 
refusal of any offer of payment or performance with respect to, or any 
substitutions for, the Secured Obligations or any subordination of the 
Secured Obligations to any other obligations;

(vi) the validity, perfection, non-perfection or lapse in perfection, 
priority or avoidance of any security interest or lien, the release of any 
or all collateral securing, or purporting to secure, the Secured 
Obligations or any other impairment of such collateral;

(vii) any exercise of remedies with respect to any security for the Secured 
Obligations (including, without limitation, any collateral, including the 
Collateral securing or purporting to secure any of the Secured Obligations) 
at such time and in such order and in such manner as the Agent and the 
Secured Parties may decide and whether or not every aspect thereof is 
commercially reasonable and whether or not such action constitutes an 
election of remedies and even if such action operates to impair or 
extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or 
remedy that any Grantor would otherwise have and without limiting the 
generality of the foregoing or any other provisions hereof, each Grantor 
hereby expressly waives any and all benefits which might otherwise be 
available to such Grantor under applicable law; and

(viii) any other circumstance whatsoever which may or might in any manner 
or to any extent vary the risk of any Grantor as an obligor in respect of 
the Secured Obligations or which constitutes, or might be construed to 
constitute, an equitable or legal discharge of the Borrower or any other 
Grantor for the Secured Obligations, or of such Grantor under the guarantee 
contained in the Credit Agreement or of any security interest granted by 
any Grantor, whether in a Bankruptcy Proceeding or in any other instance.
 
31

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(b) In addition each Grantor further waives any and all other defenses, 
set- offs or counterclaims (other than a defense of payment or performance 
in full hereunder) which may at any time be available to or be asserted by 
it, the Borrower or any other Grantor or Person against any Secured Party, 
including, without limitation, failure of consideration, breach of 
warranty, statute of frauds, statute of limitations, accord and 
satisfaction and usury.

(c) Each Grantor waives diligence, presentment, protest, marshaling, demand 
for payment, notice of dishonor, notice of default and notice of nonpayment 
to or upon the Borrower or any of the other Grantors with respect to the 
Secured Obligations. Except for notices provided for herein, each Grantor 
hereby waives notice (to the extent permitted by applicable law) of any 
kind in connection with this Agreement or any collateral securing the 
Secured Obligations, including, without limitation, the Collateral. When 
making any demand hereunder or otherwise pursuing its rights and remedies 
hereunder against any Grantor, Agent may, but shall be under no obligation 
to, make a similar demand on or otherwise pursue such rights and remedies 
as it may have against Borrower, any other Grantor or any other Person or 
against any collateral security or guarantee for the Secured Obligations or 
any right of offset with respect thereto, and any failure by Agent to make 
any such demand, to pursue such other rights or remedies or to collect any 
payments from Borrower, any other Grantor or any other Person or to realize 
upon any such collateral security or guarantee or to exercise any such 
right of offset, or any release of Borrower, any other Grantor or any other 
Person or any such collateral security, guarantee or right of offset, shall 
not relieve any Grantor of any obligation or liability hereunder, and shall 
not impair or affect the rights and remedies, whether express, implied or 
available as a matter of law, of Secured Party against any Grantor. For the 
purposes hereof demand shall include the commencement and continuance of 
any legal proceedings.


SECTION 8. THE COLLATERAL AGENT

8.1. Authority of Agent. (a) Each Grantor acknowledges that the rights and 
responsibilities of the Agent under this Agreement with respect to any 
action taken by the Agent or the exercise or non-exercise by the Agent of 
any option, voting right, request, judgment or other right or remedy 
provided for herein or resulting or arising out of this Agreement shall, as 
between the Agent and the other Secured Parties, be governed by the Credit 
Agreement and by such other agreements with respect thereto as may exist 
from time to time among them, but, as between the Agent and the Grantors, 
the Agent shall be conclusively presumed to be acting as agent for the 
Secured Parties with full and valid authority so to act or refrain from 
acting, and no Grantor shall be under any obligation, or entitlement, to 
make any inquiry respecting such authority.

(b) The Agent has been appointed to act as Agent hereunder by the Lenders 
and, by their acceptance of the benefits hereof, the other Secured Parties. 
The Agent shall be obligated, and shall have the right hereunder, to make 
demands, to give notices, to exercise or
 
32

------------------------------------------------------------------------
refrain from exercising any rights, and to take or refrain from taking any 
action (including, without limitation, the release or substitution of 
Collateral), solely in accordance with this Agreement and the Credit 
Agreement. The provisions of the Credit Agreement relating to the Agent, 
including without limitation, the provisions relating to resignation or 
removal of the Agent (subject to Section 8.3(e) hereof) and the powers and 
duties and immunities of the Agent, are incorporated herein by this 
reference and shall survive any termination of the Credit Agreement.

8.2. Duty of Agent. The Agents sole duty with respect to the custody, 
safekeeping and physical preservation of the Collateral in its possession, 
under Section 9-207 of the UCC or otherwise, shall be to deal with it in 
the same manner as the Agent deals with similar property for its own 
account. Neither the Agent nor any other Secured Party nor any of their 
respective officers, directors, partners, employees, agents, attorneys or 
other advisors, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates shall be liable for failure 
to demand, collect or realize upon any of the Collateral or for any delay 
in doing so or shall be under any obligation to sell or otherwise dispose 
of any Collateral upon the request of any Grantor or any other Person or to 
take any other action whatsoever with regard to the Collateral or any part 
thereof. The powers conferred on the Secured Parties hereunder are solely 
to protect the Secured Parties interests in the Collateral and shall not 
impose any duty upon any Secured Party to exercise any such powers. The 
Secured Parties shall be accountable only for amounts that they actually 
receive as a result of the exercise of such powers, and neither they nor 
any of their officers, directors, partners, employees, agents, attorneys 
and other advisors, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates shall be responsible to 
any Grantor for any act or failure to act hereunder, except to the extent 
that any such act or failure to act is found by a final and nonappealable 
decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted solely and 
proximately from their own gross negligence or willful misconduct in breach 
of a duty owed to such Grantor.

8.3. Exculpation of the Agent. (a) The Agent shall not be responsible to 
any Secured Party for the execution, effectiveness, genuineness, validity, 
enforceability, collectability or sufficiency hereof or of any Security 
Document or the validity or perfection of any security interest or for any 
representations, warranties, recitals or statements made herein or therein 
or made in any written or oral statements or in any financial or other 
statements, instruments, reports or certificates or any other documents 
furnished or made by the Agent to the Secured Parties or by or on behalf of 
any Secured Party to the Agent or any Secured Party in connection with the 
Security Documents and the transactions contemplated thereby or for the 
financial condition or business affairs of any Loan Party or any other 
Person liable for the payment of any Secured Obligations, nor shall the 
Agent be required to ascertain or inquire as to the performance or 
observance of any of the terms, conditions, provisions, covenants or 
agreements contained in any of the Security Documents or as to the 
existence or possible existence of any Event of Default or Default or to 
make any disclosures with respect to the foregoing.

(b) Neither the Agent nor any of its officers, partners, directors, 
employees or agents shall be liable to the Secured Parties for any action 
taken or omitted by the Agent under or in connection with any of the 
Security Documents except to the extent caused solely and
 
33

------------------------------------------------------------------------
proximately by the Agents gross negligence or willful misconduct, as 
determined by a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent 
jurisdiction. The Agent shall be entitled to refrain from any act or the 
taking of any action in connection herewith or any of the Security 
Documents or from the exercise of any power, discretion or authority vested 
in it hereunder or thereunder unless and until the Agent shall have been 
instructed in respect thereof by the Required Lenders and, upon such 
instruction, the Agent shall be entitled to act or (where so instructed) 
refrain from acting, or to exercise such power, discretion or authority, in 
accordance with such written instructions. Without prejudice to the 
generality of the foregoing, (i) the Agent shall be entitled to rely, and 
shall be fully protected in relying, upon any communication, instrument or 
document believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed 
or sent by the proper Person or Persons, and shall be entitled to rely and 
shall be protected in relying on opinions and judgments of attorneys (who 
may be attorneys for the Grantors and their Subsidiaries), accountants, 
experts and other professional advisors selected by it; and (ii) no Secured 
Party shall have any right of action whatsoever against the Agent as a 
result of the Agent acting or refraining from acting hereunder or under any 
of the Security Documents in accordance with the Credit Agreement.

(c) Without limiting the indemnification provisions of the Credit 
Agreement, each of the Secured Parties not party to the Credit Agreement 
severally agrees to indemnify the Agent, to the extent that the Agent shall 
not have been reimbursed by any Loan Party, for and against any and all 
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, 
suits, costs, expenses (including counsel fees and disbursements) or 
disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, 
incurred by or asserted against the Agent in exercising its powers, rights 
and remedies or performing its duties hereunder or under the Security 
Documents or otherwise in its capacity as the Agent in any way relating to 
or arising out of this Agreement or the Security Documents; provided, no 
such Secured Party shall be liable for any portion of such liabilities, 
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, 
expenses or disbursements resulting solely and proximately from the Agents 
gross negligence or willful misconduct, as determined by a final, 
non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. If any 
indemnity furnished to the Agent for any purpose shall, in the opinion of 
the Agent, be insufficient or become impaired, the Agent may call for 
additional indemnity and cease, or not commence, to do the acts 
insufficiently indemnified against until such additional indemnity is 
furnished.

(d) No direction given to the Agent which imposes, or purports to impose, 
upon the Agent any obligation not set forth in or arising under this 
Agreement or any Security Document accepted or entered into by the Agent 
shall be binding upon the Agent.

(e) Prior to the Discharge of the Secured Obligations, the Agent may resign 
at any time in accordance with Section 8.06 of the Credit Agreement. After 
the Agents resignation in accordance with Section 8.06 of the Credit 
Agreement, the provisions of Section 8 hereof and of Section 8 of the 
Credit Agreement shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any 
actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as Agent. 
Upon the acceptance of any appointment as the Agent by a successor Agent in 
accordance with Section 8.06 of the Credit Agreement, the retiring Agent 
shall promptly transfer all Collateral within its possession
 
34

------------------------------------------------------------------------
or control to the possession or control of the successor Agent and shall 
execute and deliver such notices, instructions and assignments as may be 
necessary or desirable to transfer the rights of the Agent in respect of 
the Collateral to the successor Agent.

8.4. Delegation of Duties. The Agent may perform any and all of its duties 
and exercise its rights and powers under this Agreement or under any other 
Security Document by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the 
Agent. The Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all of its 
duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective 
Affiliates. All of the rights, benefits, and privileges (including the 
exculpatory and indemnification provisions) of this Section 8 shall apply 
to any such sub-agent and to any of the Affiliates of the Agent and any 
such sub-agents, and shall apply to their respective activities as if such 
sub-agent and Affiliates were named herein in connection with the 
transactions contemplated hereby and by the Security Documents. 
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each sub-agent appointed 
by the Agent or Affiliate of the Agent or Affiliate of any such sub-agent 
shall be a third party beneficiary under this Agreement with respect to all 
such rights, benefits and privileges (including exculpatory rights and 
rights to indemnification) and shall have all of the rights and benefits of 
a third party beneficiary, including an independent right of action to 
enforce such rights, benefits and privileges (including exculpatory rights 
and rights to indemnification) directly, without the consent or joinder of 
any other Person, against any or all of the Loan Parties and the Secured 
Parties, and such rights, benefits and privileges (including exculpatory 
rights and rights to indemnification) shall not be modified or amended 
without the consent of such sub-agent or Affiliate acting in such capacity.

8.5. No Individual Foreclosure, Etc. No Secured Party shall have any right 
individually to realize upon any of the Collateral or to enforce any 
guarantee of the Secured Obligations except to the extent expressly 
contemplated by this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, it being 
understood and agreed that all powers, rights and remedies under the Loan 
Documents may be exercised solely by the Agent on behalf of the Secured 
Parties in accordance with the terms thereof. Each Secured Party, whether 
or not a party hereto, will be deemed, by its acceptance of the benefits of 
the Collateral and of the guarantees of the Secured Obligations provided 
hereunder and under any other Loan Documents, to have agreed to the 
foregoing provisions and the other provisions of this Agreement. Without 
limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Secured Party authorizes the 
Agent to credit bid all or any part of the Secured Obligations held by it.


SECTION 9. MISCELLANEOUS

9.1. Amendments in Writing. None of the terms or provisions of this 
Agreement may be waived, amended, supplemented or otherwise modified except 
by a written instrument executed by each affected Grantor and the Agent, 
provided that any provision of this Agreement imposing obligations on any 
Grantor may be waived by the Agent in a written instrument executed by the 
Agent. After the Discharge of the Secured Obligations, the provisions of 
this Agreement may be waived, amended, supplemented or otherwise modified 
by a written instrument executed by each Grantor.
 
35

------------------------------------------------------------------------
9.2. Notices. All notices, requests and demands to or upon the Agent or any 
Grantor hereunder shall be effected in the manner provided for in Section 
9.01 of the Credit Agreement.

9.3. No Waiver by Course of Conduct; Cumulative Remedies. No Secured Party 
shall by any act (except by a written instrument pursuant to Section 9.1), 
delay, indulgence, omission or otherwise be deemed to have waived any right 
or remedy hereunder or to have acquiesced in any Default or Event of 
Default. No failure to exercise, nor any delay in exercising, on the part 
of any Secured Party, any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate 
as a waiver thereof. No single or partial exercise of any right, power or 
privilege hereunder shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or 
the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. A waiver by any 
Secured Party of any right or remedy hereunder on any one occasion shall 
not be construed as a bar to any right or remedy which such Secured Party 
would otherwise have on any future occasion. The rights and remedies herein 
provided are cumulative, may be exercised singly or concurrently and are 
not exclusive of any other rights or remedies provided by law.

9.4. Enforcement Expenses; Indemnification. Each Grantor agrees to (1) pay 
or reimburse each Secured Party for all its costs and expenses incurred in 
enforcing or preserving any rights under this Agreement and (2) indemnify 
each Secured Party, in each case to the same extent that the Borrower is 
obligated to do so pursuant to Section 9.05 of the Credit Agreement. The 
agreements in this Section shall survive repayment of the Secured 
Obligations and all other amounts payable under the Credit Agreement and 
the other Loan Documents.

9.5. Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon the 
successors and assigns of each Grantor and shall inure to the benefit of 
the Secured Parties and their successors and assigns; provided that no 
Grantor may assign, transfer or delegate any of its rights or obligations 
under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the Agent, unless 
permitted under the Credit Agreement, and any such assignment, transfer or 
delegation without such consent shall be null and void.

9.6. Set-Off. Each Grantor hereby irrevocably authorizes each Secured Party 
at any time and from time to time while an Event of Default shall have 
occurred and be continuing, without notice to such Grantor or any other 
Grantor, any such notice being expressly waived by each Grantor, to set-off 
and appropriate and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or 
demand, provisional or final), in any currency, and any other credits, 
indebtedness or claims, in any currency, in each case whether direct or 
indirect, absolute or contingent, matured or unmatured, at any time held or 
owing by such party to or for the credit or the account of such Grantor, or 
any part thereof in such amounts as such Secured Party may elect, against 
and on account of the obligations and liabilities of such Grantor to such 
Secured Party hereunder and claims of every nature and description of such 
Secured Party against such Grantor, in any currency, whether arising 
hereunder, under the Credit Agreement, any other Loan Document or 
otherwise, as such Secured Party may elect, whether or not any Secured 
Party has made any demand for payment and although such obligations, 
liabilities and claims may be contingent or unmatured, provided that, if 
such Secured Party is a Lender, it complies with
 
36

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Section 9.06 of the Credit Agreement. Each Secured Party exercising any 
right of set-off shall notify such Grantor promptly of any such set-off and 
the application made by such Secured Party of the proceeds thereof, 
provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity 
of such set-off and application. The rights of each Secured Party under 
this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including, 
without limitation, other rights of set-off) which such Secured Party may 
have.

9.7. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed by one or more of the 
parties to this Agreement on any number of separate counterparts (including 
by facsimile or other electronic imaging means), and all of said 
counterparts taken together shall be deemed to constitute one and the same 
instrument. Delivery of an executed signature page of this Agreement by 
facsimile or other electronic transmission (e.g. pdf or tif format) 
shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart hereof.

9.8. Severability. Any provision of this Agreement which is prohibited or 
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be 
ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without 
invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or 
unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render 
unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. The parties hereto 
shall endeavor in good-faith negotiations to replace any invalid, illegal 
or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of 
which comes as close as possible to that of the invalid, illegal or 
unenforceable provisions.

9.9. Section Headings. The Section headings and Table of Contents used in 
this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and are not to affect 
the construction hereof or be taken into consideration in the 
interpretation hereof.

9.10. Integration/Conflict. This Agreement and the other Loan Documents 
represent the entire agreement of the Grantors, the Agent and the other 
Secured Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof, and 
supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or 
written, relating to the subject matter hereof and thereof. There are no 
promises, undertakings, representations or warranties by the Agent or any 
other Secured Party relative to the subject matter hereof and thereof not 
expressly set forth or referred to herein or therein. In the case of any 
Collateral located outside the United States (including any Equity 
Interests of an Issuer organized under a jurisdiction other than the United 
States of any state or other locality thereof), in the event of any 
conflict or inconsistency between the provisions of this Agreement and the 
provisions of any applicable Foreign Security Document which cannot be 
resolved by both provisions being complied with, the provisions contained 
in such Foreign Security Document shall govern to the extent of such 
conflict with respect to such Collateral. In the event that any of the 
Collateral hereunder is also subject to a valid and enforceable Lien under 
the terms of a Mortgage securing the Secured Obligations and the terms 
thereof are inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, then with 
respect to such Collateral, the terms of such Mortgage shall control in the 
case of fixtures and real property leases, letting and licenses of, and 
contracts and agreements relating to the lease of, real property, and the 
terms of this Agreement shall control in the case of all other Collateral.
 
37

------------------------------------------------------------------------
9.11. GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY DISPUTE, CLAIM OR CONTROVERSY 
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT (WHETHER ARISING IN CONTRACT, 
TORT OR OTHERWISE) SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED AND INTERPRETED IN 
ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT REGARD TO 
CONFLICTS OF LAW RULES THAT WOULD RESULT IN THE APPLICATION OF A DIFFERENT 
GOVERNING LAW (OTHER THAN ANY MANDATORY PROVISIONS OF THE UCC RELATING TO 
THE LAW GOVERNING PERFECTION AND THE EFFECT OF PERFECTION OR PRIORITY OF 
THE SECURITY INTERESTS).

9.12. Submission to Jurisdiction; Waivers. Each Grantor hereby irrevocably 
and unconditionally:

(a) submits for itself and its property in any legal action or proceeding 
relating to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents (whether arising in 
contract, tort or otherwise) to which it is a party, or for recognition and 
enforcement of any judgment in respect thereof, to the exclusive general 
jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York sitting in the Borough 
of Manhattan, the courts of the United States for the Southern District of 
New York sitting in the Borough of Manhattan, and appellate courts from any 
thereof;

(b) agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding 
shall be heard and determined in such New York state court or, to the 
fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in such federal court;

(c) agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be 
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the 
judgment or in any other manner provided by law and that nothing in this 
agreement or any other Loan Document shall affect any right that any 
Secured Party may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating 
to this Agreement or any other Loan Document against such Grantor or any of 
its assets in the courts of any jurisdiction;

(d) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any 
objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any 
action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any 
other Loan Document in any court referred to in paragraph (a) of this 
Section (and irrevocably waives to the fullest extent permitted by 
applicable law the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of 
such action or proceeding in any such court);

(e) consents to service of process in the manner provided in Section 9.17 
of the Credit Agreement (and agrees that nothing in this Agreement will 
affect the right of any party hereto to serve process in any other manner 
permitted by applicable law); and

(f) waives, to the maximum extent not prohibited by law, any right it may 
have to claim or recover any special, exemplary, punitive or consequential 
damages.
 
38

------------------------------------------------------------------------
9.13. Acknowledgments. Each Grantor hereby acknowledges that:

(a) it has been advised by counsel in the negotiation, execution and 
delivery of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which it is a 
party;

(b) no Secured Party has any fiduciary relationship with or duty to any 
Grantor arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or any of the 
other Loan Documents and the provisions of Section 9.23 of the Credit 
Agreement are incorporated herein, mutatis mutandis (to apply to this 
Agreement rather than the Credit Agreement), and the relationship between 
the Grantors, on the one hand, and the Secured Parties, on the other hand, 
in connection herewith or therewith is solely that of debtor and creditor;

9.14. Additional Grantors. Each Subsidiary of either the Borrower or 
Holdings that is required to become a party to this Agreement pursuant to

delivery by such Subsidiary of an Assumption Agreement in the form of 
Annex 1 hereto.

hereby as set forth in Section 9.20 of the Credit Agreement. This Agreement 
and all obligations (other than those expressly stated to survive such

without delivery of any instrument or performance of any act by any party, 
and all rights to the Collateral shall revert to the Grantors upon a 
Discharge of the Secured Obligations.

(b) Each Grantor acknowledges that, except upon release pursuant to clause 
(a) above, it is not authorized to file any financing statement or 
amendment or termination statement with respect to any financing statement 
originally filed in connection herewith without the prior written consent 
of the Agent, subject to such Grantors rights under Section 9-509(d)(2) of 
the UCC.

THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A 
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF

TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, 
TORT, BREACH OF DUTY, COMMON LAW, STATUTE OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY 
HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER 
PERSON HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PERSON

AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED

Computer-Implemented Apparatus And Method For Generating A Tailored 
Promotion
 
This patent relates to apparatus and/or methods used in electronic 
commerce.
 
The apparatus is connected to a distributed communication network as well 
as a consumer information storage system. The consumer information storage 
contains, amongst other things, a consumer identifier storage system and 
one or more site identifiers. The site identifiers themselves include, for 
each site, information pertaining to websites visited by a particular user 
(associated with a particular user identifier). Additionally, the 
electronic commerce apparatus receives the activity information, stores the 
activity information in the consumer information storage, and uses the 
activity information to create a tailored promotion and to present the 
tailored promotion to the consumer upon the consumers visit to a second 
website.
 
One embodiment of the method includes the steps of obtaining information 
relating to the activity of a consumer when the consumer visits a first 
website and storing consumer preference information contained in the 
activity information. Next, a request for a second website is received and 
a tailored promotion for the consumer from saved preference information is 
created. The tailored promotion is presented to the consumer at the second 
website.

Method And System For Modifying And Transmitting Data Between A Portable 
Computer And A Network
 
This patent relates to a system that assists a mobile client in interacting 
with associated computers. The system includes a mobile device (e.g., a 
PDA), a broker, a mini-server and a personal agent. The mobile device 
transmits requests, which include identification information and security 
information, to the mini-server (either directly or through a broker). 
Public and restricted requests are transmitted to the mini-server, which 
responds to the requests by providing information accessible through the 
internet. Private requests are transmitted to the personal agent. Secure 
connections between the mobile device, broker, mini-server and personal 
agent are used if required by the security level of the request. The 
mini-server or personal agent obtains the requested information and formats 
the requested information according to the requirements of the mobile 
client identification. The requested information is transmitted to the 
mobile client in a format which accounts for the visual display limitations 
of the mobile client.

the Agent) for the Secured Parties (as defined in the Collateral 
Agreement referred to below), and             , a             corporation 
(the Issuer).

WHEREAS, the Grantor has granted to the Agent for the benefit of the 
Secured Parties a security interest in the uncertificated securities of the 
Issuer owned by the Grantor from time to time (collectively, the Pledged 
Securities), and all additions thereto and substitutions and proceeds 
thereof (collectively, with the Pledged Securities, the Collateral) 
pursuant to a Collateral Agreement, dated as of [ 🌑 ], 2017 (as amended, 
restated, supplemented, or otherwise modified from time to time, the 
Collateral Agreement), among the Grantor and the other persons party 
thereto as grantors in favor of the Agent.

WHEREAS, the following terms which are defined in Articles 8 and 9 of the 
Uniform Commercial Code in effect in the State of New York on the date 
hereof (the UCC) are used herein as so defined: Adverse Claim, Control, 
Instruction, Proceeds and Uncertificated Security.

NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and 
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as 
follows:

Issuer are entering into this Control Agreement to perfect, and to confirm 
the priority of, the Agents security interest in the Collateral. The 
Issuer acknowledges that this Control Agreement constitutes written 
notification to the Issuer of the Agents security interest in the 
Collateral. The Issuer agrees to promptly make all necessary entries or 
notations in its books and records to reflect the Agents security interest 
in the Collateral and, upon request by the Agent, to register the Agent as 
the registered owner of any or all of the Pledged Securities. The Issuer 
acknowledges that the Agent has control over the Collateral.

SECTION 2. Collateral. The Issuer hereby represents and warrants to, and 
agrees with the Grantor and the Agent that (i) the terms of any limited 
liability company interests or partnership interests included in the 
Collateral from time to time shall expressly provide that they are

from time to time in the State of [ISSUERS JURISDICTION], (ii) the Pledged 
Securities are uncertificated securities, (iii) the issuers jurisdiction 
is, and during the term of this Control Agreement shall

hereof and (v) except for the claims and interests of the Agent and the 
Grantor in the Collateral, the Issuer does not know of any claim to or 
security interest or other interest in the Collateral.

SECTION 3. Control. The Issuer hereby agrees, upon written direction from 
the Agent and without further consent from the Grantor, (a) to comply with 
all instructions and directions of any kind originated by the Agent 
concerning the Collateral, to liquidate or otherwise dispose of the 
Collateral as and to the extent directed by the Agent and to pay over to 
the Agent all proceeds without any set-off or deduction, and (b) except as 
otherwise directed by the Agent, not to comply with the instructions or 
directions of any kind originated by the Grantor or any other person.

SECTION 4. Other Agreements. The Issuer shall notify promptly the Agent and 
the Grantor if any other person asserts any lien, encumbrance, claim 
(including any adverse claim) or security interest in or against any of the 
Collateral. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this 
Control Agreement and any other agreement governing the Pledged Securities 
or the Collateral, the provisions of this Control Agreement shall control.

SECTION 5. Protection of Issuer. The Issuer may rely and shall be protected 
in acting upon any notice, instruction or other communication that it 
reasonably believes to be genuine and authorized.

SECTION 6. Termination. This Control Agreement shall terminate 
automatically upon receipt by the Issuer of written notice executed by the 
Agent that (i) the Discharge of the Secured Obligations has occurred, or 
(ii) all of the Collateral has been released, whichever is sooner, and the 
Issuer shall thereafter be relieved of all duties and obligations 
hereunder.

SECTION 8. Amendments in Writing. None of the terms or provisions of this 
Control Agreement may be waived, amended, supplemented or otherwise 
modified except by a written instrument executed by the parties hereto.

agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties 
with respect to the subject matter hereof.

SECTION 10. Execution in Counterparts. This Control Agreement may be 
executed in any number of counterparts by one or more parties to this

SECTION 11. Successors and Assigns. This Control Agreement shall be binding 
upon the successors and assigns of each of the parties hereto and shall

unenforceable in any respect, the validity, legality and enforceability of 
the remaining provisions contained herein shall not in any way be affected 
or impaired thereby (it being understood that the invalidity of a 
particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not in and of

The parties hereto shall endeavor in good-faith negotiations to replace the

economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the invalid, 
illegal or unenforceable provisions.

(c) agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be 
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the 
judgment or in any other manner provided by law and that nothing in this

assets in the courts of any jurisdiction;

(d) consents that any such action or proceeding may be brought in such

plead or claim the same;

(e) agrees that service of process in any such action or proceeding may be 
effected by mailing a copy thereof by registered or certified mail (or any 
substantially similar form of mail), postage prepaid, to the Grantor at its 
address referred to in Section 7 of this Control Agreement or at such other 
address of which the Agent shall have been notified pursuant thereto;

(f) agrees that nothing herein shall affect the right to effect service of 
process in any other manner permitted by law; and

terms or phrases when used herein shall mean payment in cash in immediately

(d) The use herein of the word include or including, when following any 
general statement, term or matter, shall not be construed to limit such 
statement, term or matter to the specific items or matters set forth 
immediately following such word or to similar items or matters, whether or 
not non-limiting language (such as without limitation or but not limited

SECTION 2. GUARANTEE

2.1. Guarantee of Guaranteed Obligations. Each of the Guarantors hereby, 
jointly and severally, absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably, 
guarantees, as primary obligor and not merely as surety, to the Agent, for 
the benefit of the Guaranteed Parties and their respective successors, 
indorsees, transferees and assigns, the prompt and complete payment and 
performance by each other Guarantor, including the Borrower, when due 
(whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) of the 
Guaranteed Obligations. Each Guarantor shall be liable under its guarantee 
set forth in this Section 2.1, without any limitation as to amount, for all 
present and future Guaranteed Obligations, including specifically all 
future increases in the outstanding amount of the Loans or other Guaranteed 
Obligations and other future increases in the Guaranteed Obligations, 
whether or not any such increase is committed, contemplated or provided for 
by the Loan Documents, on the date hereof. Without limiting the generality 
of the foregoing, each Guarantors liability shall extend to all Guaranteed 
Obligations (including, without limitation, interest, fees, costs and 
expenses) that would be owed by any other obligor on the Guaranteed 
Obligations but for the fact that they are unenforceable or not allowable 
due to the existence of a Bankruptcy Proceeding involving such other 
obligor because it is the intention of the Guarantors and Guaranteed 
Parties that the Guaranteed Obligations which are guaranteed by the 
Guarantors pursuant hereto should be determined without regard to any rule 
of law or order which may relieve the Borrower or any other Guarantor of 
any portion of such Guaranteed Obligations.
 
4

------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.2. Limitation on Obligations Guaranteed. (a) Notwithstanding any other 
provision hereof, the right of recovery against each Guarantor under 
Section 2 hereof shall not exceed $1.00 less than the lowest amount which 
would render such Guarantors obligations under Section 2 hereof void or 
voidable under applicable law, including, without limitation, the Uniform 
Fraudulent Conveyance Act, Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar 
foreign, federal or state law to the extent applicable to the guaranty set 
forth herein and the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder. To effectuate 
the foregoing, the Agent and the Guarantors hereby irrevocably agree that 
the Guaranteed Obligations of each Guarantor in respect of the guarantee 
set forth in Section 2 hereof at any time shall be limited to the maximum 
amount as will result in the Guaranteed Obligations of such Guarantor with 
respect thereto hereof not constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance 
after giving full effect to the liability under such guarantee set forth in 
Section 2 hereof and its related contribution rights but before taking into 
account any liabilities under any other guarantee by such Guarantor. For 
purposes of the foregoing, all guarantees of such Guarantor other than the 
guarantee under Section 2 hereof will be deemed to be enforceable and 
payable after the guaranty under Section 2 hereof. To the fullest extent 
permitted by applicable law, this Section 2.2(a) shall be for the benefit 
solely of creditors and representatives of creditors of each Guarantor and 
not for the benefit of such Guarantor or the holders of any Equity Interest 
in such Guarantor.

(b) Each Guarantor agrees that Obligations may at any time and from time to 
time be incurred or permitted in an amount exceeding the maximum liability 
of such Guarantor under Section 2.2 (a) without impairing the guarantee 
contained in this Section 2 or affecting the rights and remedies of any 
Guaranteed Party hereunder.

(c) In respect of the UK Guarantors, this guarantee does not apply to any 
liability to the extent that it would result in this guarantee constituting 
unlawful financial assistance within financial assistance within the 
meaning of Section 678 of the Companies Act.

2.3. Nature of Guarantee; Continuing Guarantee; Waivers of Defenses Etc. 
(a) Each Guarantor understands and agrees that the guarantee contained in 
this Section 2 shall be construed as a continuing guarantee of payment and 
performance and not merely of collectability. Each Guarantor waives 
diligence, presentment, protest, marshaling, demand for payment, notice of 
dishonor, notice of default and notice of nonpayment to or upon the 
Borrower or any of the other Guarantors with respect to the Guaranteed 
Obligations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, this 
Guaranty and the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall be valid and 
enforceable and shall extend to the ultimate balance of the Guaranteed 
Obligations, without any reduction, limitation, impairment, set-off, 
defense, counterclaim, discharge or termination for any reason (other than 
a Discharge of the Guaranteed Obligations). If any Guarantor is a natural 
person, it is expressly agreed that this guarantee shall survive the death 
of such guarantor and shall continue in effect.
 
5

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(b) Each Guarantor agrees that the Guaranteed Obligations of each Guarantor 
hereunder are independent of the Guaranteed Obligations of each other 
Guarantor and of any other guarantee of the Guaranteed Obligations and when 
making any demand hereunder or otherwise pursuing its rights and remedies 
hereunder against any Guarantor, any Guaranteed Party may, but shall be 
under no obligation to, make a similar demand on or otherwise pursue such 
rights and remedies as it may have against the Borrower and any other 
Guarantor or any other Person or against any collateral security or other 
guarantee for the Guaranteed Obligations or any right of offset with 
respect thereto, and any failure by any Guaranteed Party to make any such 
demand, to pursue such other rights or remedies or to collect any payments 
from the Borrower and any other Guarantor or any other Person or to realize 
upon any such collateral security or guarantee or to exercise any such 
right of offset, or any release of the Borrower and any other Guarantor or 
any other Person or any such collateral security, guarantee or right of 
offset, shall not relieve any Guarantor of any obligation or liability 
hereunder, and shall not impair or affect the rights and remedies, whether 
express, implied or available as a matter of law, of any Guaranteed Party 
against any Guarantor. For the purposes hereof demand shall include the 
commencement and continuance of any legal proceedings.

(c) No payment made by the Borrower, any of the other Guarantors, any other 
guarantor or any other Person or received or collected by any Guaranteed 
Party from the Borrower and any of the other Guarantors, any other 
guarantor or any other Person by virtue of any action or proceeding or any 
set-off or appropriation or application at any time or from time to time in 
reduction of or in payment of the Guaranteed Obligations shall be deemed to 
modify, reduce, release or otherwise affect the liability of any Guarantor 
hereunder which shall, notwithstanding any such payment remain liable for 
the Guaranteed Obligations until the Discharge of the Guaranteed 
Obligations.

(d) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Guarantor agrees 
that its obligations under and in respect of the guarantee contained in 
this Section 2 and any security interest, if any, securing the Guaranteed 
Obligations, shall not be affected by, and shall remain in full force and 
effect without regard to, and hereby waives all, rights, claims or defenses 
that it might otherwise have (now or in the future) with respect to each of 
the following (whether or not such Guarantor has knowledge thereof):

(i) the validity or enforceability of the Credit Agreement or any other 
Loan Document, any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any guarantee or right 
of offset with respect thereto at any time or from time to time held by any 
Guaranteed Party;

(ii) any renewal, extension or acceleration of, or any increase in the 
amount of the Guaranteed Obligations, or any amendment, supplement, 
modification or waiver of, or any consent to departure from, the Loan 
Documents;

(iii) any failure or omission to assert or enforce or agreement or election 
not to assert or enforce, delay in enforcement, or the stay or enjoining, 
by order of court, by operation of law or otherwise, of the exercise or 
enforcement of, any claim or demand or any right, power or remedy (whether 
arising under any Loan Documents, at law, in equity or otherwise) with 
respect to the Guaranteed Obligations or any agreement relating thereto, or 
with respect to any other guaranty of or security for the payment of the 
Guaranteed Obligations;
 
6

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(iv) any change, reorganization or termination of the corporate structure 
or existence of Borrower or any other Guarantor or any of their 
Subsidiaries and any corresponding restructuring of the Guaranteed 
Obligations;

(v) any settlement, compromise, release, or discharge of, or acceptance or 
refusal of any offer of payment or performance with respect to, or any 
substitutions for, the Guaranteed Obligations or any subordination of the 
Guaranteed Obligations to any other obligations;

(vi) the validity, perfection, non-perfection or lapse in perfection, 
priority or avoidance of any security interest or lien, the release of any 
or all collateral securing, or purporting to secure, the Guaranteed 
Obligations or any other impairment of such collateral;

(vii) any exercise of remedies with respect to any security for the 
Guaranteed Obligations (including, without limitation, any collateral, 
including the Collateral securing or purporting to secure any of the 
Guaranteed Obligations) at such time and in such order and in such manner 
as the Agent and the Guaranteed Parties may decide and whether or not every 
aspect thereof is commercially reasonable and whether or not such action 
constitutes an election of remedies and even if such action operates to 
impair or extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other 
right or remedy that any Guarantor would otherwise have and without 
limiting the generality of the foregoing or any other provisions hereof, 
each Guarantor hereby expressly waives any and all benefits which might 
otherwise be available to such Guarantor under applicable law; and

(viii) any other circumstance whatsoever which may or might in any manner 
or to any extent vary the risk of any Guarantor as an obligor in respect of 
the Guaranteed Obligations or which constitutes, or might be construed to 
constitute, an equitable or legal discharge of the Borrower or any other 
Guarantor for the Guaranteed Obligations, or of such Guarantor under the 
guarantee contained in this Section 2 or of any security interest granted 
by any Guarantor, whether in a Bankruptcy Proceeding or in any other 
instance.

(e) In addition each Guarantor further waives any and all other defenses, 
set- offs or counterclaims (other than a defense of payment or performance 
in full hereunder) which may at any time be available to or be asserted by 
it, the Borrower or any other Guarantor or person against any Guaranteed 
Party, including, without limitation, failure of consideration, breach of 
warranty, statute of frauds, statute of limitations, accord and 
satisfaction and usury.

2.4. Rights of Reimbursement, Contribution and Subrogation. In case any 
payment is made on account of the Guaranteed Obligations by any Guarantor 
or is received or collected on account of the Guaranteed Obligations from 
any Guarantor or its property:

(a) If such payment is made by a Guarantor (including the Borrower) or from 
its property in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations of another Guarantor, 
such Guarantor shall be entitled, subject to and upon (but not before) a 
Discharge of the Guaranteed Obligations, (A)
 
7

------------------------------------------------------------------------
to demand and enforce reimbursement for the full amount of such payment 
from such other Guarantor, and (B) to demand and enforce contribution in 
respect of such payment from each other Guarantor which has not paid its 
fair share of such payment, as necessary to ensure that (after giving 
effect to any enforcement of reimbursement rights provided hereby) each 
Guarantor pays its fair share of the unreimbursed portion of such payment. 
For this purpose, the fair share of each Guarantor as to any unreimbursed 
payment shall be determined based on an equitable apportionment of such 
unreimbursed payment among all Guarantors (other than the Guarantor whose 
primary obligations were so guaranteed by the other Guarantors) based on 
the relative value of their assets and any other equitable considerations 
deemed appropriate by the court. For purposes of the foregoing, all 
guarantees of such Guarantor other than the guarantee under Section 2 
hereof will be deemed to be enforceable and payable after the guaranty 
under Section 2 hereof.

(b) If and whenever any right of reimbursement or contribution becomes 
enforceable by any Guarantor (including the Borrower) against any other 
Guarantor (including the Borrower) whether under Section 2.4(a) or 
otherwise, such Guarantor shall be entitled, subject to and upon (but not 
before) a Discharge of the Guaranteed Obligations, to be subrogated 
(equally and ratably with all other Guarantors entitled to reimbursement or 
contribution from any other Guarantor as set forth in this Section 2.4) to 
any security interest that may then be held by the Agent upon any 
collateral securing or purporting to secure any of the Guaranteed 
Obligations. Any right of subrogation of any Guarantor (including the 
Borrower) shall be enforceable solely after a Discharge of the Guaranteed 
Obligations and solely against the Guarantors, and not against the 
Guaranteed Parties, and neither the Agent nor any other Guaranteed Party 
shall have any duty whatsoever to warrant, ensure or protect any such right 
of subrogation or to obtain, perfect, maintain, hold, enforce or retain any 
collateral securing or purporting to secure any of the Guaranteed 
Obligations for any purpose related to any such right of subrogation. If 
subrogation is demanded by any Guarantor, then, after Discharge of the 
Guaranteed Obligations, the Agent shall deliver to the Guarantors making 
such demand, or to a representative of such Guarantors or of the Guarantors 
generally, an instrument satisfactory to the Agent transferring, on a 
quitclaim basis without any recourse, representation, warranty or any other 
obligation whatsoever, whatever security interest the Agent then may hold 
in whatever collateral securing or purporting to secure any of the 
Guaranteed Obligations that may then exist that was not previously released 
or disposed of or acquired by the Agent.

(c) All rights and claims arising under this Section 2.4 or based upon or 
relating to any other right of reimbursement, indemnification, contribution 
or subrogation that may at any time arise or exist in favor of any 
Guarantor (including the Borrower) as to any payment on account of either 
(x) the Guaranteed Obligations or (y) any other obligation that is secured 
by any collateral that also secures or purports to secure any of the 
Guaranteed Obligations, in each case made by it or received or collected 
from its property shall be fully subordinated to the Guaranteed Obligations 
in all respects prior to the Discharge of the Guaranteed Obligations. Until 
Discharge of the Guaranteed Obligations, no Guarantor may demand or receive 
any collateral security, payment or distribution whatsoever (whether in 
cash, property or securities or otherwise) on account of any such right or 
claim. If any such payment or distribution is made or becomes available to 
any Guarantor in any Bankruptcy Case, receivership, or Bankruptcy 
Proceeding, such payment or distribution shall be delivered by the
 
8

------------------------------------------------------------------------
person making such payment or distribution directly to the Agent, for 
application to the payment of the Guaranteed Obligations. If any such 
payment or distribution is received by any Guarantor, it shall be held by 
such Guarantor in trust, as trustee of an express trust for the benefit of 
the Guaranteed Parties, and shall forthwith be transferred and delivered by 
such Guarantor to the Agent, in the exact form received and, if necessary, 
duly endorsed.

(d) The obligations of the Guarantors under this Guaranty and the other 
Loan Documents, including their liability for the Guaranteed Obligations 
and the enforceability of the security interests granted thereby, are not 
contingent upon the validity, legality, enforceability, collectability or 
sufficiency of any right of reimbursement, contribution or subrogation 
arising under this Section 2.4 or otherwise. The invalidity, insufficiency, 
unenforceability or uncollectability of any such right shall not in any 
respect diminish, affect or impair any such obligation or any other claim, 
interest, right or remedy at any time held by any Guaranteed Party against 
any Guarantor or its property. The Guaranteed Parties make no 
representations or warranties in respect of any such right and shall have 
no duty to assure, protect, enforce or ensure any such right or otherwise 
relating to any such right.

2.5. Payments. Each Guarantor hereby guarantees that payments hereunder 
will be paid to the Agent without set-off or counterclaim in Dollars in 
immediately available funds at the office of the Agent as specified in the 
Credit Agreement.

2.6. Subordination of Other Obligations. Any Indebtedness of the Borrower 
or any other Guarantor now or hereafter held by any other Guarantor (the 
Obligee Guarantor), whether as original creditor, assignee, or by way of 
subrogation, restitution or otherwise, is hereby subordinated in right of 
payment to the Guaranteed Obligations, and any such Indebtedness collected 
or received by the Obligee Guarantor after an Event of Default has occurred 
and is continuing shall be held in trust for the Agent on behalf of the 
Guaranteed Parties and shall forthwith be paid over to the Agent for the 
benefit of the Guaranteed Parties to be credited and applied against the 
Guaranteed Obligations but without affecting, impairing or limiting in any 
manner the liability of the Obligee Guarantor under any other provision 
hereof.

2.7. Financial Condition of Borrower and other Guarantors. Any Credit Event 
may be made to the Borrower or continued from time to time, without notice 
to or authorization from any Guarantor regardless of the financial or other 
condition of Borrower or any other Guarantor at the time of any such grant 
or continuation. No Guaranteed Party shall have any obligation to disclose 
or discuss with any Guarantor its assessment, or any Guarantors 
assessment, of the financial condition of the Borrower or any other 
Guarantor. Each Guarantor has adequate means to obtain information from the 
Borrower and each other Guarantor on a continuing basis concerning the 
financial condition of the Borrower and each other Guarantor and its 
ability to perform its obligations under the Loan Documents, and each 
Guarantor assumes the responsibility for being and keeping informed of the 
financial condition of the Borrower and each other Loan Party and each 
other Guarantor and of all circumstances bearing upon the risk of 
nonpayment of the Guaranteed Obligations. Each Guarantor hereby waives and 
relinquishes any duty on the part of any Guaranteed Party to disclose any 
matter, fact or thing relating to the business, operations or condition of 
the Borrower or any other Guarantor now known or hereafter known by any 
Guaranteed Party.
 
9

------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.8. Bankruptcy, Etc. The obligations of the Guarantors hereunder shall not 
be reduced, limited, impaired, discharged, deferred, suspended or 
terminated by any case or Bankruptcy Proceeding, voluntary or involuntary, 
involving the Borrower or any other Guarantor or by any defense which the 
Borrower or any Guarantor may have by reason of the order, decree or 
decision of any court or administrative body resulting from any such 
proceeding. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Guarantors will 
permit any trustee in bankruptcy, receiver, debtor in possession, assignee 
for the benefit of creditors or similar person to pay the Agent, or allow 
the claim of the Agent in respect of, any interest, fees, costs, expenses 
or other Guaranteed Obligations accruing or arising after the date on which 
such case or proceeding is commenced.

2.9. Duration of Guarantee, Discharge of Guarantee Upon Sale of Guarantor. 
(a) Except as provided in Section 2.9(b) below and Section 9.20 of the 
Credit Agreement, and subject to Section 2.10 below, the guarantee 
contained in this Section 2 shall remain in full force and effect until the 
Discharge of the Guaranteed Obligations.

(b) If (i) all of the Equity Interests of any Guarantor or any of its 
successors in interest hereunder shall be sold or otherwise disposed of 
(including by merger or consolidation) in accordance with the terms and 
conditions of the Loan Documents to a Person that is not an Affiliate of 
the Borrower or any other Guarantor or (ii) a Guarantor is no longer a 
Foreign Subsidiary Loan Party or Subsidiary Loan Party, as applicable, in 
accordance with the Credit Agreement, then in the case of each of clauses 
(i) and (ii), the guaranty of such Guarantor or such successor in interest, 
as the case may, hereunder shall automatically be discharged and released 
without any further action by any Guaranteed Party or other Person 
effective as of the time of such sale, disposition or other transaction.

2.10. Reinstatement. If at any time payment of any of the Guaranteed 
Obligations or any portion thereof is rescinded, disgorged or must 
otherwise be restored or returned by any Guaranteed Party upon the 
insolvency, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or reorganization of the 
Borrower or any Guarantor, or upon or as a result of the appointment of a 
receiver, intervenor or conservator of, or trustee or similar officer for, 
the Borrower or any other Guarantor or any substantial part of its 
property, or otherwise, or if any Guaranteed Party repays, restores, or 
returns, in whole or in part, any payment or property previously paid or 
transferred to the Guaranteed Party in full or partial satisfaction of any 
Guaranteed Obligation, because the payment or transfer or the incurrence of 
the obligation is so satisfied, is declared to be void, voidable, or 
otherwise recoverable under any state or federal law (collectively a 
Voidable Transfer), or because such Guaranteed Party elects to do so on 
the reasonable advice of its counsel in connection with an assertion that 
the payment, transfer, or incurrence is a Voidable Transfer, then, as to 
any such Voidable Transfer, and as to all reasonable costs, expenses and 
attorneys fees of the Guaranteed Party related thereto, the liability of 
each Guarantor hereunder will automatically and immediately be revived, 
reinstated, and restored and will exist as though the Voidable Transfer had 
never been made.

2.11. Keepwell. Each Qualified ECP Guarantor hereby jointly and severally 
absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably undertakes to provide such 
funds or other support as may be needed from time to time by each other 
Loan Party to honor all of its obligations under this Guaranty in respect 
of Swap Obligations (provided, however, that each Qualified ECP Guarantor
 
10

------------------------------------------------------------------------
shall only be liable under this Section 2.11 for the maximum amount of such 
liability that can be hereby incurred without rendering its obligations 
under this Section 2.11, or otherwise under this Guaranty, as it relates to 
such Loan Party, voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent 
conveyance or fraudulent transfer, and not for any greater amount). The 
obligations of each Qualified ECP Guarantor under this Section shall remain 
in full force and effect until a Discharge of the Guaranteed Obligations. 
Each Qualified ECP Guarantor intends that this Section 2.11 constitute, and 
this Section 2.11 shall be deemed to constitute, a keepwell, support, or 
other agreement for the benefit of each other Loan Party for all purposes 
of Section 1a(18)(A)(v)(II) of the Commodity Exchange Act.

2.12. Swiss Up-stream and Cross-stream Limitation and Withholding Tax.

(a) If and to the extent that a Guarantor incorporated under the laws of 
Switzerland (for the purpose of this Section a Swiss Guarantor) under 
this Guaranty Agreement guarantees or otherwise secures obligations other 
than obligations of one of its direct or indirect subsidiaries (i.e. 
obligations of such Swiss Guarantors direct or indirect parent companies 
(up-stream liabilities) or sister companies (cross-stream liabilities)) 
(the Restricted Obligations) and that the making of a payment in 
fulfilling the guarantee obligations under Section 2 hereof with respect to 
Restricted Obligations would under Swiss corporate law (inter alia, 
prohibiting capital repayments or restricting distributions), at the time 
payment is due, not be permitted, then such obligations and payment amount 
shall from time to time be limited to the amount permitted to be paid under 
Swiss corporate law; provided that such limited amount shall at no time be 
less than such Swiss Guarantors distributable capital at the time or times 
payment under or pursuant to Section 2 hereof is requested from such Swiss 
Guarantor, and further provided that such limitation (as may apply from 
time to time or not) shall not (generally or definitively) release such 
Swiss Guarantor from payment obligations hereunder in excess thereof, but 
merely postpone the payment date therefore until such times as payment is 
again permitted notwithstanding such limitation. Any and all indemnities 
and other financial undertakings assumed by a Swiss Guarantor under this 
Guaranty Agreement shall be construed in a manner consistent with the 
provisions of this Section 2.12.

(b) In case a Swiss Guarantor must make a payment in respect of Restricted 
Obligations under this Guaranty Agreement and is obliged to withhold Swiss 
withholding tax (Verrechnungssteuer) (Swiss Withholding Tax) in respect 
of such payment, such Swiss Guarantor shall:

(i) procure that such payments can be made without deduction of Swiss 
Withholding Tax, or with deduction of Swiss Withholding Tax at a reduced 
rate, by discharging the liability to such tax by notification pursuant to 
applicable law (including double tax treaties) rather than payment of the 
tax;

(ii) if the notification procedure pursuant to sub-paragraph (i) above does 
not apply, deduct Swiss Withholding Tax at the rate of 35% (or such other 
rate as in force from time to time), or if the notification procedure 
pursuant to sub-paragraph (i) above applies for a part of the Swiss 
Withholding Tax only, deduct Swiss Withholding Tax at the reduced rate 
resulting after the discharge of part of such tax by notification
 
11

------------------------------------------------------------------------
under applicable law, from any payment made by it in respect of Restricted 
Obligations and promptly pay any such taxes to the Swiss Federal Tax 
Administration (Eidgenössische Steuerverwaltung);

(iii) notify the Collateral Agent that such notification, or as the case 
may be, deduction has been made and provide the Collateral Agent with 
evidence that such a notification of the Swiss Federal Tax Administration 
has been made or, as the case may be, such taxes deducted have been paid to 
the Swiss Federal Tax Administration;

(iv) in the case of a deduction of Swiss Withholding Tax:

(1) use its best efforts to ensure that any person other than a Guaranteed 
Party, which is entitled to a full or partial refund of the Swiss 
Withholding Tax deducted from such payment in respect of Restricted 
Obligations, will, as soon as possible after such deduction (A) request a 
refund of the Swiss Withholding Tax under applicable law (including tax 
treaties) and (B) pay to the Collateral Agent upon receipt any amounts so 
refunded; and

(2) if a Guaranteed Party is entitled to a full or partial refund of the 
Swiss Withholding Tax deducted from such payment, and if requested by the 
Collateral Agent, shall provide the Collateral Agent (on its behalf or on 
behalf of any Guaranteed Party) those documents that are required by law 
and applicable tax treaties to be provided by the payer of such tax, for 
each relevant Guaranteed Party, to prepare a claim for refund of Swiss 
Withholding Tax.

(c) If a Swiss Guarantor is obliged to withhold Swiss Withholding Tax in 
accordance with paragraph (b) above, the Collateral Agent shall be entitled 
to further enforce the guarantee and any other indemnity granted by such 
Swiss Guarantor under this Guaranty Agreement and/or further apply proceeds 
therefrom against the Restricted Obligations up to an amount which is equal 
to that amount which would have been obtained if no withholding of Swiss 
Withholding Tax were required, whereby such further 
enforcements/applications of proceeds shall always be limited to the 
maximum amount of the freely distributable capital of such Swiss Guarantor 
as set out in paragraph (a) above.

(d) If and to the extent requested by the Collateral Agent or if and to the 
extent required under Swiss mandatory law (with regards to restricting 
distributions) applicable at the relevant time, in order to allow the 
Collateral Agent (and the Guaranteed Parties) to obtain a maximum benefit 
under this Guaranty, the Swiss Guarantor shall, and any parent company of 
such Swiss Guarantor being a party to this Guaranty Agreement shall procure 
that such Swiss Guarantor will, promptly implement all such measures and/or 
promptly procure the fulfilment of all prerequisites allowing it to 
promptly make the (requested) payment(s) hereunder from time to time, 
including the following:

(i) preparation of an up-to-date audited balance sheet of the Swiss 
Guarantor;
 
12

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(ii) obtain a confirmation of the auditors of the Swiss Guarantor 
confirming the maximum amount of the freely distributable capital;

(iii) approval by a shareholders meeting of the Swiss Guarantor of the 
(resulting) distribution;

(iv) to the extent permitted by applicable law, write up or realize any of 
the Swiss Guarantors assets that are shown in its balance sheet with a 
book value that is significantly lower than the market value of the assets, 
in case of realization, however, only if such assets are not necessary for 
the Swiss Guarantors business (nicht betriebsnotwendig); and

(v) all such other measures necessary or useful to allow the Swiss 
Guarantor to make the payments and perform the obligations hereunder with a 
minimum of limitations.


2.13. Guarantor Intent. Each UK Guarantor expressly confirms that it 
intends that this Guaranty Agreement shall extend from time to time to any 
(however fundamental) variation, increase, extension or addition of or to 
any of the Loan Documents and/or any facility or amount made available 
under any of the Loan Documents for the purposes of or in connection with 
any of the following: business acquisitions of any nature; increasing 
working capital; enabling investor distributions to be made; carrying out 
restructurings; refinancing existing facilities; refinancing any other 
indebtedness; making facilities available to new borrowers; any other 
variation or extension of the purposes for which any such facility or 
amount might be made available from time to time; and any fees, costs 
and/or expenses associated with any of the foregoing.


SECTION 3. REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS OF THE GUARANTORS.

3.1. Representations and Warranties. Each Guarantor represents and warrants 
to the Guaranteed Parties on the Closing Date and on the date of each 
Credit Event that the representations and warranties set forth in Section 3 
of the Credit Agreement as they relate to such Guarantor or to the Loan 
Documents to which such Guarantor is a party, each of which is incorporated 
herein by reference, are true and correct in all material respects, except 
for representations and warranties that are qualified as to materiality, 
Material Adverse Effect or similar language, in which case such 
representations and warranties shall be true and correct (after giving 
effect to any such qualification therein) in all respects as of such date, 
in each case unless expressly stated to relate to a specific earlier date, 
in which case such representations and warranties shall be true and correct 
in all material respects as of such earlier date, and the Guaranteed 
Parties shall be entitled to rely on each of such representations and 
warranties as if they were fully set forth herein, provided that each such 
reference in each such representation and warranty to any Borrowers 
knowledge shall, for the purposes of this Section 3.1, be deemed to be a 
reference to such Guarantors knowledge.
 
13

------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.2. Covenants. Each Guarantor covenants and agrees with the Guaranteed 
Parties that, from and after the date of this Guaranty until the Discharge 
of the Guaranteed Obligations, such Guarantor shall take, or shall refrain 
from taking, as the case may be, each action that is necessary to be taken 
or not taken, as the case may be, so that no Default or Event of Default is 
caused by the failure to take such action or to refrain from taking such 
action by such Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries.
 
SECTION  4.   	POWER OF ATTORNEY AND FURTHER ASSURANCES

4.1. Agents Appointment as Attorney-in-Fact, Etc. Each Guarantor hereby 
irrevocably constitutes and appoints the Agent and any officer or agent 
thereof, with full power of substitution, as its true and lawful 
attorney-in-fact with full irrevocable power and authority in the place and 
stead of such Guarantor and in the name of such Guarantor or in its own 
name, for the purpose of carrying out the terms of this Agreement, to take 
any and all appropriate action and to execute any and all documents and 
instruments which may be necessary or desirable to accomplish the purposes 
of this Agreement.

4.2. Further Assurances. Each Guarantor agrees that from time to time, at 
the expense of such Guarantor, it shall promptly execute and deliver all 
further instruments and documents and take all further action that may be 
necessary or desirable, or that the Agent may reasonably request, in order 
to ensure that the Guaranteed Parties receive the intended benefits hereof 
or to enable the Agent to exercise and enforce its rights and remedies 
hereunder.

4.3. Parallel Debt.

(a) For the purpose of this Section 4.3 Corresponding Obligations means 
any and all payment obligations, whether present or future, actual or 
contingent, that may at any time be owing by a Guarantor (in whichever 
capacity, including as Borrower) to a Guaranteed Party (in whichever 
capacity, including as Agent or Lender) under any of the Loan Documents 
(other than the payment obligations to the Collateral Agent under this 
Section 4.3).

(b) Each Guarantor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally undertakes to pay 
to the Collateral Agent at any time amounts equal to the amounts due by it 
in respect of the Corresponding Obligations. Each payment undertaking of a 
Guarantor under this Section 4.3 to be referred to as a Parallel Debt.

(c) Each Parallel Debt will be payable in the currency or currencies of the 
relevant Corresponding Obligation and will become due and payable as and 
when and to the extent the relevant Corresponding Obligation becomes due 
and payable.

(d) Each of the parties to this Agreement hereby acknowledges that:

(i) each Parallel Debt constitutes an undertaking, obligation and liability 
to the Collateral Agent which is separate and independent from, and without 
prejudice to, the Corresponding Obligations of the relevant Guarantor;

(ii) the Collateral Agent acts in its own name and not as trustee, agent or 
representative of the Guaranteed Parties or any one of them for the purpose 
of this Section 4.3, other than with respect to paragraph (iii) below, and 
that each Parallel Debt represents the Collateral Agents own separate and 
independent claim to receive payment of that Parallel Debt from the 
relevant Guarantor; and
 
14

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(iii) any discharge of a Parallel Debt in full or in part shall to the same 
extent decrease the Corresponding Obligation to which its corresponds, and 
any discharge of a Corresponding Obligation in full or in part shall to the 
same extent decrease the Parallel Debt that corresponds to it,

it being understood, in each case, that the amounts which may be payable by 
each Guarantor as Parallel Debt at any time shall never exceed the total of 
the amounts which are payable under or in connection with the Corresponding 
Obligations at that time.

(e) To the extent the Collateral Agent irrevocably receives or recovers any 
amount in payment of a Parallel Debt of a Guarantor, the Collateral Agent 
shall distribute such amount among the Guaranteed Parties who are creditors 
of the Corresponding Obligation of that Guarantor in accordance with the 
terms of the Credit Agreement, as if such amount were received or recovered 
by the Collateral Agent in payment of the Corresponding Obligation to which 
it corresponds.
 
SECTION  5.  MISCELLANEOUS 	

5.1. Amendments in Writing. None of the terms or provisions of this 
Guaranty may be waived, amended, supplemented or otherwise modified except 
by a written instrument executed by each affected Guarantor and the Agent, 
provided that any provision of this Guaranty imposing obligations on any 
Guarantor may be waived by the Agent in a written instrument executed by 
such Agent in accordance with Section 9.09 of the Credit Agreement.

5.2. Notices. All notices, requests and demands to or upon the Agent or any 
Guarantor hereunder shall be effected in the manner provided for in Section 
9.01 of the Credit Agreement.

5.3. No Waiver by Course of Conduct; Cumulative Remedies. No Guaranteed 
Party shall by any act (except by a written instrument pursuant to Section 
5.1), delay, indulgence, omission or otherwise be deemed to have waived any 
right or remedy hereunder or to have acquiesced in any Default or Event of 
Default. No failure to exercise, nor any delay in exercising, on the part 
of any Guaranteed Party, any right, power or privilege hereunder shall 
operate as a waiver thereof. No single or partial exercise of any right, 
power or privilege hereunder shall preclude any other or further exercise 
thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. A waiver by 
any Guaranteed Party of any right or remedy hereunder on any one occasion 
shall not be construed as a bar to any right or remedy which such 
Guaranteed Party would otherwise have on any future occasion. The rights 
and remedies herein provided are cumulative, may be exercised singly or 
concurrently and are not exclusive of any other rights or remedies provided 
by law.

5.4. Enforcement Expenses; Indemnification. (a) Each Guarantor agrees to 
(i) pay or reimburse each Guaranteed Party for all its costs and expenses 
incurred under this Agreement and (ii) to indemnify the Guaranteed Parties, 
in each case to the extent such Guarantor is obligated to do so pursuant to 
Section 9.05 of the Credit Agreement or to the extent that the Borrower is 
obligated to do so pursuant to Section 9.05 of the Credit Agreement and the 
Borrower fails to do so.
 
15

------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.5. Successors and Assigns. This Guaranty shall be binding upon the 
successors and assigns of each Guarantor and shall inure to the benefit of 
the Guaranteed Parties and their successors and assigns; provided that no 
Guarantor may assign, transfer or delegate any of its rights or obligations 
under this Guaranty without the prior written consent of the Agent unless 
permitted by the Credit Agreement and any such assignment, transfer or 
delegation without such consent shall be null and void.

5.6. Set-Off. Each Guarantor hereby irrevocably authorizes each Guaranteed 
Party at any time and from time to time while an Event of Default shall 
have occurred and be continuing, without notice to such Guarantor or any 
other Guarantor, any such notice being expressly waived by each Guarantor, 
to set-off and appropriate and apply any and all deposits (general or 
special, time or demand, provisional or final), in any currency, and any 
other credits, indebtedness or claims, in any currency, in each case 
whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, matured or unmatured, 
at any time held or owing by such party to or for the credit or the account 
of such Guarantor, or any part thereof in such amounts as such Guaranteed 
Party may elect, against and on account of the obligations and liabilities 
of such Guarantor to such Guaranteed Party hereunder and claims of every 
nature and description of such Guaranteed Party against such Guarantor, in 
any currency, whether arising hereunder, under the Credit Agreement, any 
other Loan Document or otherwise, as such Guaranteed Party may elect, 
whether or not any Guaranteed Party has made any demand for payment and 
although such obligations, liabilities and claims may be contingent or 
unmatured, provided that, if such Guaranteed Party is a Lender, it complies 
with Section 9.06 of the Credit Agreement. Each Guaranteed Party exercising 
any right of set-off shall notify such Guarantor promptly of any such 
set-off and the application made by such Guaranteed Party of the proceeds 
thereof, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the 
validity of such set-off and application. The rights of each Guaranteed 
Party under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies 
(including, without limitation, other rights of set-off) which such 
Guaranteed Party may have.

5.7. Counterparts. This Guaranty may be executed by one or more of the 
parties to this Guaranty on any number of separate counterparts (including 
by facsimile or other electronic imaging means), and all of said 
counterparts taken together shall be deemed to constitute one and the same 
instrument. Delivery of an executed signature page of this Guaranty by 
facsimile or other electronic transmission (e.g. pdf or tif format) 
shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart hereof.

5.8. Severability. Any provision of this Guaranty which is prohibited or 
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be 
ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without 
invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or 
unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render 
unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. The parties hereto 
shall endeavor in good-faith negotiations to replace any invalid, illegal 
or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of 
which comes as close as possible to that of the invalid, illegal or 
unenforceable provisions.

CONFLICTS OF LAW RULES THAT WOULD RESULT IN THE APPLICATION OF A DIFFERENT 
GOVERNING LAW.

5.12. Submission to Jurisdiction; Waivers. Each Guarantor hereby 
irrevocably and unconditionally:

(a) submits for itself and its property in any legal action or proceeding 
relating to this Guaranty (whether arising in contract, tort or otherwise)

fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in such federal court;

(c) agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be 
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the

have to bring any action or proceeding relating to this Guaranty against 
the Guarantor or any of its assets in the courts of any jurisdiction;

(d) waives to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any objection 
that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any action or

fullest extent permitted by applicable law the defense of an inconvenient 
forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court);
 
17

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(e) consents to service of process in the manner provided in Section 9.17

(f) waives, to the maximum extent not prohibited by law, any right it may 
have to claim or recover any special, exemplary, punitive or consequential

5.13. Acknowledgments. Each Guarantor hereby acknowledges that:

(a) it has been advised by counsel in the negotiation, execution and 
delivery of this Guaranty and the other Loan Documents to which it is a 
party;

(b) no Guaranteed Party has any fiduciary relationship with or duty to any 
Guarantor arising out of or in connection with this Guaranty or any of the 
other Loan Documents, and the relationship between the Guarantors, on the 
one hand, and the Guaranteed Parties, on the other hand, in connection 
herewith or therewith is solely that of debtor and creditor; and

(c) no joint venture is created hereby or by the other Loan Documents or 
otherwise exists by virtue of the transactions contemplated hereby among 
the parties hereto.

5.14. Additional Guarantors. Each Subsidiary of Holdings or the Borrower or 
other Person that is required to become a party to this Agreement pursuant 
to Section 5.11 of the Credit Agreement shall become a Guarantor as 
required by the Credit Agreement for all purposes of this Agreement upon 
execution and delivery by such Subsidiary of a Joinder Agreement in the

Guaranteed Obligations, this Agreement and all obligations (other than 
those expressly stated to survive such termination) of the Agent and each 
Guarantor hereunder shall terminate, all without delivery of any instrument 
or performance of any act by any party. At the request and sole expense of 
any Guarantor following any such termination, the Agent shall execute and 
deliver to such Guarantor such documents as such Guarantor shall reasonably 
request to evidence such termination.

5.16. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO

EXHIBIT F
AUCTION PROCEDURES

Summary. The Borrower may conduct one or more Auctions in order to make 
Auction Prepayments pursuant to the procedures described in this Exhibit F.

Notice Procedures. In connection with an Auction, the Borrower will provide 
notification to the Administrative Agent, for distribution to the Lenders 
(an Auction Notice, substantially in the form attached hereto as Annex A 
with such changes therein as the Borrower and the Administrative Agent may 
agree). Each Auction Notice shall contain (a) an aggregate prepayment 
amount (each, an Auction Amount), which may be expressed at the election 
of the Borrower as either (i) the total par principal amount of the Class 
or Classes of Term Loans offered to be prepaid or (ii) the total cash 
amount offered to be paid pursuant to the Auction, (b) the discount to par, 
which shall be a range (the Discount Range), equal to a percentage of par 
of the principal amount of the applicable Class or Classes of Term Loans 
expressed as a price per $1,000; provided that the par principal amount of 
the Term Loans offered to be prepaid in each Auction shall be in a minimum 
aggregate amount of $1,000,000 and with minimum increments of $100,000 (it 
being understood that the par principal amount of Term Loans actually 
prepaid may be less than the minimum amount in the event that the aggregate 
par principal amount of Term Loans actually offered to be available for 
prepayment by Lenders in such Auction is less than the minimum amount) and 
(c) the date by which Lenders are required to indicate their election to 
participate in such proposed Auction (the Acceptance Date) which shall be 
at least five Business Days following the date of the Auction Notices.

Reply Procedures. In connection with any Auction, each Lender may provide 
the Administrative Agent with a notice of participation with respect to 
Term Loans (the Return Bid, substantially in the form attached hereto as 
Annex B with such changes therein as the Borrower and the Administrative 
Agent may agree) which shall specify (i) a discount to par that must be 
expressed as a price per $1,000 (the Reply Price), which must be within 
the applicable Discount Range and (ii) a par principal amount of the 
applicable Class or Classes of Term Loans which must be in increments of 
$100,000 (subject to rounding requirements specified by the Administrative 
Agent) (the Reply Amount). The foregoing minimum increment amount 
condition shall not apply if a Lender submits a Reply Amount equal to such 
Lenders entire remaining amount of its applicable Class or Classes of Term 
Loans. Lenders may only submit one Return Bid per Auction in their capacity 
as a Term Lender; provided that the Borrower and the Administrative Agent 
may elect to permit multiple bids, in which case the Borrower and the 
Administrative Agent may agree to establish procedures under which each 
Return Bid may contain up to three bids, only one of which can result in a 
Qualifying Bid (as defined below). Any Lender with outstanding Term Loans 
whose Reply Bid is not received by the Administrative Agent by the 
Acceptance Date shall be deemed to have declined to accept an Auction 
Prepayment of any of its Term Loans at any discount to their par value 
within the Discount Range.

Acceptance Procedures. Based on the Reply Prices and Reply Amounts received 
by the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent, in consultation with 
the Borrower, will determine the applicable discounted price (the 
Applicable Discounted Price) for the Auction,
 
F-1

------------------------------------------------------------------------
which will be the lower of (i) the lowest Reply Price for which the 
Borrower can complete the Auction at the Auction Amount and (ii) in the 
event that the aggregate amount of the Reply Amounts relating to such 
Auction Notice are insufficient to allow the Borrower to prepay the entire 
Auction Amount, the highest Reply Price that is within the Discount Range 
so that the Borrower can complete the Auction at such aggregate amount of 
Reply Amounts. The Borrower shall prepay the applicable Class or Classes of 
Term Loans (or the respective portions thereof) from each Lender with a 
Reply Price that is equal to or less than the Applicable Discounted Price 
(Qualifying Bids) at the Applicable Discounted Price; provided that if 
the aggregate amount required to prepay Qualifying Bids (or, in the case of 
an Auction Amount expressed as a total par principal amount, if the 
aggregate par principal amounts of the Qualifying Bids) would exceed the 
Auction Amount for such Auction, the Borrower shall prepay such Qualifying 
Bids at the Applicable Discounted Price ratably based on the respective 
principal amounts of such Qualifying Bids (subject to rounding requirements 
specified by the Administrative Agent). In any Auction for which the 
Administrative Agent and the Borrower have elected to permit multiple bids, 
if a Lender has submitted a Return Bid with respect to the applicable Class 
or Classes of Term Loans containing multiple bids at different Reply 
Prices, only the bid with the highest Reply Price that is equal to or less 
than the Applicable Discounted Price will be deemed the Qualifying Bid with 
respect to the applicable Class or Classes of Term Loans of such Lender. 
Each participating Lender will receive notice of a Qualifying Bid as soon 
as reasonably practicable.

Additional Procedures. In connection with any Auction, upon submission by a 
Lender of a Qualifying Bid, such Lender will be obligated to accept the 
prepayment of the entirety or its pro rata portion of its applicable Class 
or Classes of Term Loans in the Reply Amount at the Applicable Discounted 
Price. The Borrower will not have any obligation to prepay any Term Loans 
outside of the applicable Discount Range nor will any Return Bids outside 
such applicable Discount Range be considered in any calculation of the 
Applicable Discounted Price or satisfaction of the Auction Amount. Each 
prepayment of Term Loans in an Auction shall be consummated pursuant to 
procedures (including as to response deadlines for Return Bids, settlement 
periods, rounding amounts, type and Interest Period of accepted Term Loans, 
and calculation of Applicable Discounted Price referred to above) 
established by the Administrative Agent and agreed to by the Borrower. The 
Borrower may extend the Acceptance Date of an Auction by notice given at 
least 24 hours before the Acceptance Date set forth in the Auction Notice. 
The provisions of this Exhibit G shall not limit or restrict the Borrower 
from making voluntary prepayments of any Term Loans in accordance with 
Section 2.11(a) of this Agreement.

Agreed Security Principles

Set forth on this Schedule 1.01(e) are the Agreed Security Principles 
referred to in the Credit Agreement, dated as of May 10, 2017 (as amended, 
extended, supplemented, amended and restated or otherwise modified from 
time to time, the Credit Agreement), by and among, AFFINION GROUP 
HOLDINGS, INC., a Delaware corporation (Holdings), AFFINION GROUP, INC.,

Credit Agreement) from time to time party thereto, HPS INVESTMENT PARTNERS, 
LLC, as administrative agent (together with any successor administrative 
agent appointed pursuant hereto, in such capacity, the Administrative 
Agent) and as collateral agent (together with any successor collateral 
agent appointed pursuant hereto, in such capacity, the Collateral Agent) 
for the Lenders. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have 
the meanings specified therefor in the Credit Agreement.


PART I

The following principles shall apply to the guarantees and security granted 
by any Foreign Subsidiary Loan Party under the Guaranty Agreement or any 
Foreign Security Document. For the avoidance of doubt, the following 
principles shall not be deemed to modify, limit or alter any provisions of 
the Collateral Agreement, the Guaranty Agreement, the Intellectual Property 
Security Agreement or any other Security Document entered into by a 
Domestic Subsidiary under New York law.


PART II
 
1. 	AGREED SECURITY PRINCIPLES
 
  	(a) 	The guarantees and security to be provided by any Loan Party will 
be given in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles set out in this 
Schedule 1.01(e). This Schedule 1.01(e) addresses the manner in which the 
Agreed Security Principles will impact the guarantees and security proposed 
to be taken in relation to this transaction.
 
  	(b) 	The Agreed Security Principles embody a recognition by all parties 
that there may be certain legal and practical impediments in obtaining 
effective guarantees and security from the Loan Parties in jurisdictions in 
which it has been agreed that guarantees and security will be granted. In 
particular:
 
  	(i) 	
general statutory limitations, regulatory requirements or restrictions, 
financial assistance, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, earnings 
stripping, controlled foreign corporation rules, thin capitalization 
rules (or analogous restrictions), tax restrictions, retention of title 
claims, employee consultation or approval requirements, capital maintenance 
rules and similar principles may prevent or limit any Loan Party from 
providing a guarantee or security or may require that the guarantee or 
security be limited in amount or otherwise, provided that, to the extent 
requested by the Collateral Agent before signing

------------------------------------------------------------------------
  	 any applicable security agreement or accession document, the relevant 
Loan Party shall use reasonable endeavors (but without incurring material 
cost and without adverse impact on relationships with third parties) to 
overcome any such obstacles or restrictions or otherwise such guarantee or 
security document shall be subject to such limit;
 
  	(ii) 	the relevant Loan Party shall use commercially reasonable 
endeavours (but without incurring material cost and without adverse impact 
on relationships with third parties) to assist in demonstrating that 
adequate corporate benefit accrues to each relevant Loan Party and to 
overcome any such other limitations to the extent not unduly burdensome;
 
  	(iii) 	the security and extent of its perfection will be agreed taking 
into account the cost to relevant Loan Party of providing security 
(including any increase to the tax cost of the Loan Parties) so as to 
ensure that it is proportionate to the benefit accruing to the Secured 
Parties (taking into account, amongst other things, materiality of the 
proposed security and relevant pledged assets in light of the security 
already granted);
 
  	(iv) 	a factor in determining whether or not a guarantee shall be taken 
is the applicable cost (including adverse effects on interest deductibility 
and stamp duty, notarization and registration fees and the burden and/or 
cost of complying with any applicable financial assistance, corporate 
benefit or thin capitalization rules) which shall not be materially and 
disproportionately greater than the benefit to the Lenders of obtaining 
such guarantee, as determined by Borrower in good faith in consultation 
with the Administrative Agent;
 
  	(v) 	Loan Parties will not be required to give guarantees or enter into 
security documents if it is not within the legal capacity of the relevant 
Loan Party or if the same would conflict with the fiduciary duties of the 
directors of the relevant Loan Party or contravene any legal or regulatory 
prohibition or would result in (or in a material risk of) personal or 
criminal liability on the part of any officer or director;
 
  	(vi) 	the granting or perfection of security, when required, and other 
legal formalities will be completed, at the Closing Date or if later, 
within the time periods specified therefor in Section 5.11 of the Credit 
Agreement and in any event no later than the time periods specified by 
applicable law in order to ensure due perfection;
 
  	(vii) 	the giving of a guarantee will not be required if it would have a 
material adverse effect on the ability of the relevant Loan Party to 
conduct its operations and business in the ordinary course as otherwise 
permitted by the Loan Documents;

------------------------------------------------------------------------
  	(viii) 	unless granted under a global security document governed by the 
law of the jurisdiction of the applicable Loan Party or under English or 
New York law, all security shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction 
of incorporation of that Loan Party or the jurisdiction of the issuer of 
any equity interests constituting Collateral thereunder or New York, as 
determined by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion;
 
  	(ix) 	the maximum guaranteed or secured amount may be limited to 
minimize stamp duty, notarization, registration or other applicable fees, 
taxes and duties where the incremental cost of such fees, taxes and duties 
is materially and disproportionately greater than the benefit to the 
Lenders of increasing the guaranteed or secured amount as determined by the 
Administrative Agent in its discretion;
 
  	(x) 	Loan Parties will not be required to give guarantees if doing so 
would be prohibited by (1) any law or regulation or (2) any contractual 
obligation in effect as of the date hereof (or, with respect to any 
subsidiary that is acquired after the date hereof, any contractual 
obligation in effect on the date of such acquisition that is not entered 
into in contemplation thereof), but only for so long as such prohibition 
exists, and provided that, the relevant Loan Party shall use reasonable 
endeavours to overcome any such obstacles or restrictions;
 
  	(xi) 	to the extent possible, the Collateral Agent will hold one set of 
security for the Secured Parties (subject to applicable law).
 
2. 	LOAN PARTIES AND SECURITY
 
  	(a) 	Subject to the guarantee limitations set out in the Loan Documents, 
each guarantee will be an upstream, cross-stream and downstream guarantee 
and security for all liabilities of the Loan Parties under the Loan 
Documents in accordance with, and subject to, the requirements of the 
Agreed Security Principles in each relevant jurisdiction. Security 
Documents will secure the Guaranteed Obligations (as defined in the 
Guaranty Agreement) of the relevant security provider, and all other 
Obligations of the Loan Parties under the Loan Documents, in each case in 
accordance with, and subject to, the requirements of the Agreed Security 
Principles in each relevant jurisdiction.
 
  	(b) 	Where a Loan Party pledges shares of a Foreign Subsidiary, the 
security document will be governed by the laws of the company whose shares 
are being pledged and not by the law of the country of the pledgor. Subject 
to these principles, the shares in each Loan Party shall be secured. The 
shares held by a Loan Party in a Subsidiary that is not a Loan Party shall 
not be required to be the subject of a Lien, unless that Subsidiary is a 
Material Subsidiary (or unless the shares in such Subsidiary can be secured 
in a global security agreement such as an English law debenture, New York 
law global security agreement or similar security agreement).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
  	(c) 	To the extent legally effective, all security shall be given in 
favor of the Collateral Agent and not the Secured Parties individually. 
Parallel debt provisions will be used where necessary; such provisions 
will be contained in the Credit Agreement or Guaranty Agreement and not the 
individual security documents unless required under local laws. No action 
will be required to be taken in relation to any guarantee or security where 
any Lender transfers or assigns any of its participation in the Credit 
Facilities.
 
  	(d) 	Any security document shall only be required to be notarized or 
notarially certified if required by law in order for the relevant security 
to become effective or admissible in evidence or otherwise perfected.
 
3. 	TERMS OF SECURITY DOCUMENTS

The following principles will be reflected in the terms of any security 
taken in respect of any Loan Party as part of this transaction:
 
  	(a) 	the security will be first ranking, except if legally impossible;
 
  	(b) 	the Collateral Agent or Secured Parties shall only be able to 
exercise a power of attorney granted by a Loan Party following the 
occurrence of an Event of Default;
 
  	(c) 	the remedies relating to any security provided by a Loan Party will 
not be enforceable until an Event of Default has occurred;
 
  	(d) 	in the Security Documents there will be no repetition of clauses 
set out in the Credit Agreement such as those relating to notices, cost and 
expenses (except in Security Documents requiring notarization), 
indemnities, tax gross up, distribution of proceeds and release of security 
if the relevant Loan Party is a party to the Credit Agreement, and, in case 
the relevant Loan Party is not a party to the Credit Agreement, such 
clauses shall be substantially consistent with those in the Credit 
Agreement; representations and undertakings shall be included in the 
Security Documents to the extent relevant under local law to the creation, 
perfection, priority or enforcement of the security interest expressed to 
be created thereby (and including in any case representations to the legal 
and beneficial ownership of the assets over which it purports to grant 
security); and
 
  	(e) 	a Lien will, where possible, automatically create security over 
future assets of the same type as those already secured; where local law 
requires supplemental pledges to be delivered in respect of future acquired 
assets in order for effective security to be created over that class of 
asset, such supplemental pledges shall be provided at intervals no more 
frequent than the relevant date on which the compliance certificate is 
required to be delivered (unless required more frequently under local law 
or advisable under standard market practice in order to ensure the 
enforceability or validity of the security interest).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. 	BANK ACCOUNTS
 
  	(a) 	[Reserved].
 
  	(b) 	If a Loan Party grants a Lien over its bank accounts it shall be 
free to deal with those accounts (other than mandatory prepayment accounts 
and any other accounts which are specifically blocked) in the ordinary 
course of its business (including closing unused or dormant accounts) until 
the occurrence of an Event of Default.
 
  	(c) 	Account control agreements shall not be required. If it is 
customary under local law (e.g., Swiss Law) or required by local law for a 
Loan Party to serve on an account bank notice of a Lien over such Loan 
Partys bank account in order to perfect such Lien, then such Loan Party 
shall serve such notice of such Lien on the account bank within five 
Business Days of the Lien being granted and such Loan Party shall use 
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain (i) an acknowledgement of that 
notice or (ii) the consent to the Lien of the account bank, where obtaining 
such consent is required by local law, in each case within 20 Business Days 
of such service of notice. If such Loan Party has used commercially 
reasonable efforts but has not been able to obtain acknowledgement its 
obligation to obtain acknowledgement shall cease on the expiration of that 
20 Business Day period (which period may be extended with the sole consent 
of the Agent) but the Loan Party shall provide satisfactory evidence to the 
Collateral Agent that the notice has been served to the account bank. If 
consent of the account bank to the Lien is required by local law to validly 
grant a Lien over a Loan Partys bank account and such consent is not 
obtained within the time period specified in the previous sentence, the 
Agent may require that Loan Party to close that account at the relevant 
account bank and open one or more bank accounts at another account bank 
that is willing to give its consent to the Lien.
 
  	(d) 	Any security over bank accounts granted by Loan Parties shall be 
subject to any prior security interests in favor of the account bank which 
are created by law or applicable standard banking terms and conditions. The 
applicable Loan Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to procure, 
where applicable in the relevant document that the account bank will waive 
any such prior security interest or limit such prior security interest to 
the account banks costs and fees in connection with the banking 
arrangements.
 
  	(e) 	If required under local law security over bank accounts granted by 
Loan Parties will be registered subject to the general principles set out 
in these Agreed Security Principles.
 
5. 	FIXED ASSETS (OTHER THAN REAL ESTATE)
 
  	(a) 	If a Loan Party grants security over its fixed and tangible 
moveable assets it shall be free to deal with those assets (subject to the 
terms of the Credit Agreement, including restrictions on Asset Sales) in 
the course of its business until the occurrence of an Event of Default.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
  	(b) 	No notice, whether to third parties or by attaching a notice to the 
fixed assets pledged by any Loan Party, shall be prepared or given until an 
Event of Default has occurred.
 
  	(c) 	If required under local law, Liens over fixed assets granted by 
Loan Parties will be registered subject to the general principles set out 
in these Agreed Security Principles.
 
6. 	INSURANCE POLICIES
 
  	(a) 	A Loan Party may grant a Lien in its insurance policies in respect 
of which claims thereunder may be mandatorily prepaid, provided that such 
insurance policy allows a Lien to be so granted.
 
  	(b) 	If it is customary under local law (e.g., Swiss law or Dutch law) 
or required by local law for a Loan Party to serve on an insurance provider 
notice of a Lien over such Loan Partys insurance policies in order to 
perfect such Lien, then such Loan Party shall serve such notice of such 
Lien on the insurance provider within five Business Days of the Lien being 
granted and such Loan Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to 
obtain (i) an acknowledgement of that notice or (ii) the consent to the 
Lien of the insurance provider, where obtaining such consent is required by 
local law, in each case within 20 Business Days of such service of notice. 
If such Loan Party has used commercially reasonable efforts but has not 
been able to obtain acknowledgement its obligation to obtain 
acknowledgement shall cease on the expiration of that 20 Business Day 
period.
 
  	(c) 	No loss payee or other endorsement shall be made on the insurance 
policy, for the avoidance of doubt, except for any policy covering property 
or liabilities of Holdings, the Borrower, or any Domestic Subsidiary as set 
forth in the Credit Agreement.
 
7. 	INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
 
  	(a) 	If a Loan Party grants a Lien over its intellectual property it 
shall be free to deal with those assets in the course of its business 
(including, without limitation, allowing its intellectual property to lapse 
if no longer material or useful to its business) until the occurrence of an 
Event of Default.
 
  	(b) 	No security shall be granted over any intellectual property of any 
Loan Party which cannot be secured under the terms of the relevant 
licensing agreement. No notice shall be prepared or given to any third 
party from whom intellectual property of any Loan Party is licensed until 
an Event of Default has occurred.
 
  	(c) 	If required under local law to perfect the Collateral Agent or 
Secured Parties Lien over such intellectual property, a Lien over 
intellectual property granted by any Loan Party will be registered under 
the law of that Security Document at a relevant supra-national registry 
(such as the EU) or otherwise at any national (or U.S. State, if 
applicable) registry subject to the general principles set out in these 
Agreed Security Principles.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
8. 	HEDGING

If a Loan Party grants a Lien in its hedging receivables it shall be 
granted subject to the same provisions as for trade receivables, except 
that notice of security shall be provided subject to the same provisions as 
for intercompany receivables.
 
9. 	INTERCOMPANY RECEIVABLES
 
  	(a) 	If a Loan Party grants a Lien in its intercompany receivables it 
shall, subject to the terms of the Credit Agreement, be free to deal with 
those receivables in the course of its business until the occurrence of an 
Event of Default.
 
  	(b) 	If it is customary under local law (e.g., Swiss law or Dutch law) 
or required by local law to perfect the Lien granted by any Loan Party, 
notice of the Lien will be served on the relevant debtor within five 
Business Days (or such longer period as the Administrative Agent may agree 
in its sole discretion) of the Lien being granted and such Loan Party shall 
obtain an acknowledgement of that notice as soon as reasonably practicable 
but, in any event, within 20 Business Days of service (or such later period 
as may be agreed in the sole discretion of the Agent).
 
  	(c) 	If required under local law, security over intercompany receivables 
granted by any Loan Party will be registered subject to the general 
principles set out in these Agreed Security Principles.
 
10. 	TRADE RECEIVABLES
 
  	(a) 	If a Loan Party grants a Lien over its trade receivables, it shall 
be free to deal with those receivables in the course of its business until 
the occurrence of an Event of Default.
 
  	(b) 	No notice of a Lien granted by any Loan Party may be served until 
the occurrence of an Event of Default. However, with respect to Liens over 
trade receivables governed by Swiss law, the Collateral Agent shall be 
entitled (but not obliged) to notify the debtors of trade receivables of 
the Lien at any time where an event or a circumstance makes a notification 
necessary in the reasonable discretion of the Collateral Agent in order to 
maintain or protect such Lien.
 
  	(c) 	No Lien will be granted over any trade receivables by any Loan 
Party which cannot be secured under any legally effective terms of the 
relevant contract.
 
  	(d) 	If required under local law, security over trade receivables 
granted by any Loan Party will be registered subject to the general 
principles set out in these Agreed Security Principles.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
  	(e) 	Any list of trade receivables required shall not include details of 
the underlying contracts but shall include the name and address of the 
debtor, the amount due and the due date. Up to date lists of trade 
receivables shall, where customary under local law (e.g. Swiss law), be 
provided for the first time within 15 days after the date of signing the 
security agreement and, thereafter, on a semi-annual basis, as per 30 June 
and 31 December of each year (in each case within 15 days after such date) 
and in any event immediately upon the occurrence of an Event of Default and 
upon request by the Collateral Agent thereafter.
 
11. 	SHARES
 
  	(a) 	Except, for the avoidance of doubt, as set forth in the Collateral 
Agreement, the Security Documents will be governed by the laws of the 
jurisdiction of incorporation of the entities whose shares or equivalent 
ownership interests are being secured and not by the law of the 
jurisdiction of incorporation of the entities granting the security, so 
long as such jurisdiction is also the jurisdiction of organization of a 
Loan Party; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, share security in 
the United States shall, if so elected by the Collateral Agent, be taken 
under the laws of the State of New York.
 
  	(b) 	Until an Event of Default has occurred, the charging Loan Party 
will be permitted to retain and to exercise voting rights pertaining to any 
shares charged by it in a manner which does not adversely affect the 
validity or enforceability of the Security or interests of the Secured 
Parties and the company whose shares have been charged will be permitted to 
pay dividends upstream on pledged shares to the extent permitted under the 
Loan Documents with the proceeds to be available to the Loan Parties 
subject to the terms of the Credit Agreement.
 
  	(c) 	Where customary and applicable as a matter of law, on, or as soon 
as reasonably practicable following execution of the share charge, the 
original share certificate and stock transfer form executed in blank (or 
other document evidencing title) will be delivered to the Collateral Agent 
(at such of its locations as it shall elect) and where required by law the 
share certificate or shareholders register (or other local law equivalent) 
will be endorsed or written up and the endorsed share certificate or a copy 
of the written up register provided to the Collateral Agent.
 
  	(d) 	Unless the restriction is required by law or regulation, the 
constitutional documents of the company whose shares have been charged will 
be amended to remove any restriction on the transfer or the registration of 
the transfer of the shares on the taking or enforcement of the security 
granted over them and any pre-emption right.
 
12. 	REAL ESTATE

A Loan Party shall not be required to grant security over its real estate 
unless it is freehold property with a value of more than $2,500,000. A Loan 
Party will be under no obligation to obtain any landlord consent required 
to grant security over its real estate, nor to investigate the possibility 
thereof.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
13. 	RELEASE OF SECURITY

With respect to collateral granted by any Loan Party, unless required by 
local law, the circumstances in which the security shall be released should 
not be dealt with in individual security documents but, if so required, 
shall, except to the extent required by local law, be the same as those set 
out in the Credit Agreement.
