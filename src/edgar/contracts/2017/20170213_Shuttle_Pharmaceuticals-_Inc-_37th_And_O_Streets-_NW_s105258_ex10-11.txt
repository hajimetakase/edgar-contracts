STATEMENT OF WORK (Phase I)
 
TITLE: 	Predictive biomarkers for prostate cancer patient sensitivity
  	for radiation late effects
 
PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR(S): 	Scott Grindrod, PhD
PROJECT DURATION: 	12 months
COMPANY: 	Shuttle Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
SUBCONTRACTORS: 	Georgetown University
 
I. 	Background Information and Objectives
   
A. 	Background Information
 
Patients treated for prostate cancer may experience treatment related late 
effects that adversely affect quality of life and may prove 
life-threatening. The objective of this Phase I SBIR application is to 
determine the technical and commercial feasibility of a biomarker panel 
predictive of radiation mediated late effects in patients treated for 
prostate cancer. We will develop a metabolite signature of radiation 
responses in a cohort of patients undergoing stereotactic body radiation 
therapy (SBRT) for prostate cancer. Analysis of banked plasma samples will 
be correlated with clinical outcomes to identify markers of urinary and 
gastrointestinal late effects for validation in a larger clinical 
population to be proposed in a subsequent Phase II application. The Phase 
II effort will allow Shuttle Pharmaceuticals to advance its proposed 
commercialization plan and to raise capital to support validation clinical 
trials leading to FDA approval.
 
Patients treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for 
prostate cancers on an IRB approved protocol have banked clinical specimens 
and detailed monitoring of quality of life parameters. Sub-sets of these 
patients have developed urinary incontinence (Ul), symptomatic urinary 
flare (USF), obstructed voiding symptoms/retention (UR) and radiation 
proctitis (RP). We have used high resolution mass spectrometry based 
metabolomics/lipidomic profiling to analyze this unique cohort of patient 
samples and propose here, to leverage our established analytical platform 
to advance product development and validation of a biomarker panel 
predictive of radiation toxicities. Metabolites in plasma from a cohort of 
100 de-identified patients will be analyzed to develop a kit supporting 
metabolomic analysis to serve as a biomarker panel predictive of patient 
susceptibility for radiation late effects.
   
B. 	Technical Objectives
 
The three technical objectives of this proposal focus on determining the 
feasibility for developing a metabolite panel predictive of clinical 
outcomes in prostate cancer patients treated with radiation therapy (SBRT). 
In Objective 1, we will use technology in the Waters Center of Excellence 
at Georgetown University to perform metabolite analysis on de-identified, 
bio-banked plasma samples from 100 patients. In the first objective, 
untargeted metabolite profiles will be obtained and analyzed for 
correlations with clinical outcomes, including cancer recurrence, urinary 
tract injury and rectal injury. Candidate metabolites will be validated and 
a metabolite "kit" will be designed and tested in Objective 2. Standard 
operating procedures (SOPs) will be prepared and purity, stability and 
storage capacity will be tested. Objective 3 is to consolidate the 
intellectual property (metabolite panels) within Georgetown University 
policies and obtain a license to develop and commercialize the biomarker 
panels. Submitting a final report to NIH staff documenting success in 
achieving the Phase I milestones will allow preparation of a phase II 
application to clinically validate the biomarker panel and support 
commercialization efforts.
 

 

 

 
Statement of Work (Phase I) Dated XX/XX/XXXX
Contract No. HHSNxxxxxxxx
 
Objective 1. Develop a metabolite biomarker panel of radiation late 
effects.
 
Task 1.1. Perform untargeted metabolomics profiling of plasma specimens 
using UPLC-ESI-QTOFMS.
 
Milestone 1.1. Metabolite raw data on clinical samples from 100 patients
 
Task 1.2. Perform biostatistics analysis of raw data to identify candidate 
metabolite signatures.
 
Milestone 1.2. Metabolite signatures for cancer recurrence, urinary tract 
injury and rectal injury.
 
  Task 1.3. Validate and evaluate biomarker performance using SID-MRM-MS.
  Identify candidate molecules for biomarker development.
   
  Milestone 1.3. Panels of validated biomarkers that correlate to cancer
  recurrence, urinary injury and rectal injury (for kit development).
   
Objective 2. Design and test a metabolite "kit" suitable for GLP clinical 
application
 
Task 2.1. Define the operating range of the biomarker assay.
   
  Milestone 2.1. Accuracy and precision of the assay is available for
  preparing standard operating procedures (SOPs).

Milestone 2.2. Purity, stability and storage capacity data for selected 
metabolites will be used in SOPs.
 
Task 2.3. Determine robustness of the assay.
 
Milestone 2.3. Assay repeatability available for the SOPs.
 
  Objective 3. Review achieved milestones, evaluate commercialization
  potential and advance a Phase II SBIR application for clinical trial
  validation of the biomarker
 
Task 3.1. Disclose intellectual property to the GU Office of Technology 
Commercialization.
 
Milestone 3.1. Provisional patent application submission.
 
Task 3.2. Prepare and submit the final report of Phase I accomplishments.
 
Milestone 3.2. Written final report is accepted by NIH staff allowing 
submission of a Phase II application.
