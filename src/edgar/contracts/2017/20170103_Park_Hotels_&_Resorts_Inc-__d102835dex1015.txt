in this Agreement (including Section 2.2.3 hereof) from (and including) the 
Closing Date to but excluding the Maturity Date.

2.2.2 Interest Calculation. Interest on each Note shall be calculated by 
multiplying (a) the actual number of days elapsed in the period for which 
the calculation is being made by (b) a daily rate based on a three hundred 
sixty (360) day year (that is, the Interest Rate applicable to such Note 
expressed as an annual rate divided by three hundred sixty (360)) by (c) 
the outstanding principal balance of such Note.

2.2.3 Default Rate. In the event that, and for so long as, any Event of

are subject to the express condition that at no time shall Borrower be 
obligated or required to pay interest on the principal balance of the Loan

of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, Borrower is at any time 
required or obligated to pay interest on the principal balance due 
hereunder at a rate in excess of the Maximum Legal Rate, the Interest Rate 
or the Default Rate, as the case may be, shall be deemed to be immediately

unpaid interest for the related Interest Period. The Monthly Debt Service

first, on a pro rata and pari passu basis, to the payment of interest due

acting reasonably. In addition, Borrower shall provide all other 
documentation Lender reasonably requires to be delivered by Borrower in 
connection with such release, together with an Officers Certificate 
certifying that such documentation (i) is in compliance with all Legal

the Taran Outparcel (together with any appurtenant easements or other

violate any of the provisions of such documents in any material respect and 
that any such release of the Taran Outparcel shall not result in any right 
in favor of a third party of offset, abatement or reduction of rent payable 
to Borrower or Operating Lessee or any right in favor of a third party of 
termination, cancellation or surrender under any Leases, reciprocal

benefit of Lender, which Borrower FF&E Account shall be under the sole 
dominion and control of Lender and entitled as set forth in the Borrower 
FF&E Account Agreement. On or before the Operating Lease Effective Date, 
(A) Operating Lessee shall establish an account (the Operating Lessee FF&E 
Account) with the FF&E Bank which shall be held in Operating Lessees name 
in trust for the benefit of Lender, which Operating Lessee FF&E Account 
shall be under the sole dominion and control of Lender and entitled as set 
forth in the applicable Operating Lessee FF&E Account Agreement and (B) 
concurrently with the opening of the Operating Lessee FF&E Account, 
Borrower shall close the Borrower FF&E Account. Schedule 2.6.1(a)(vi) 
hereof sets forth the relevant information with respect to the Borrower 
FF&E Account, and as required by the Restructuring Conditions, will be 
amended in connection with the Restructuring to replace such information 
with the relevant information with respect to the Operating Lessee FF&E 
Account.

(b) Borrower and/or Operating Lessee has caused or shall cause the delivery 
of irrevocable written instructions to each of the credit card companies or 
credit card clearing banks with which Borrower, Operating Lessee, Manager 
or any R&A Manager has entered into merchants agreements to deliver all 
receipts payable with respect to the Property directly to the applicable 
Operating Account. Borrower and Operating Lessee shall, and shall cause 
Manager and any R&A Manager to, deposit all amounts received by it or 
Manager or any R&A Manager constituting Rents into the applicable Property 
Account or the applicable Operating Account, as applicable, not less 
frequently than once every Business Day during the term of the Loan.
 
-63-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(c) Borrower or Operating Lessee, as applicable, each hereby grants to 
Lender a first priority security interest in (i) each Property Account and 
all deposits at any time contained therein and the proceeds thereof, (ii) 
each Operating Account and all deposits at any time contained therein and 
the proceeds thereof and (iii) the FF&E Account and all deposits at any 
time contained therein and the proceeds thereof, in each case, will take 
all actions necessary to maintain in favor of Lender a perfected first 
priority security interest in each Property Account, each Operating Account 
and the FF&E Account, including, without limitation, filing UCC-1 Financing 
Statements and continuations thereof. Lender and Servicer shall have the 
sole right to make withdrawals from each Property Account, the FF&E Account 
and each Operating Account; provided, that Lender shall instruct the 
Operating Account Bank to (A) make disbursements to Manager and, prior to 
an R&A Manager Event, R&A Sub-Manager, at Managers or, prior to an R&A 
Manager Event, R&A Sub-Managers request, for payment of Manager Required 
Payments (B) disburse amounts for Property Account Charges to the Property 
Accounts and (C) disburse amounts for FF&E from the FF&E Account. 
Notwithstanding Lenders sole dominion and control over the Operating 
Accounts, Lender hereby agrees that it will exercise its rights in the 
Operating Accounts in a manner that is consistent with the provisions of 
this Agreement and shall make funds available, as provided herein, for 
Manager Required Payments. All costs and expenses for establishing and 
maintaining the Property Accounts, the FF&E Account and the Operating 
Accounts shall be paid by Borrower and/or Operating Lessee. All monies now 
or hereafter deposited into each Property Account, the FF&E Account and 
each Operating Account shall be deemed additional security for the Debt.

(d) Borrower has obtained from the Property Bank, its agreement to transfer 
to the Operating Accounts (other than reasonable fees of the Property Bank 
as more particularly described in each Property Account Agreement), in 
immediately available funds by federal wire transfer or ACH transfer, all 
amounts on deposit in each Property Account less a peg balance of 
$10,000.00 (which peg balance shall be applied, from time to time at the 
request of Manager or, prior to an R&A Manager Event, R&A Sub-Manager, to 
Property Account Charges) no less frequently than on each Business Day (and 
more frequently as requested by Manager or, prior to an R&A Manager Event, 
R&A Sub-Manager) throughout the term of the Loan.

(e) Intentionally Omitted.

(f) Pursuant to each Cash Management Agreement, Lender has agreed (or, upon 
the execution of such Cash Management Agreement, will agree) to instruct 
Operating Account Bank to transfer to the applicable Cash Management 
Account (other than the reasonable fees of the Operating Account Bank as 
more particularly described in the applicable Operating Account Agreement), 
in immediately available funds by federal wire transfer or ACH transfer, 
all amounts on deposit in the applicable Operating Account not otherwise 
disbursed to, or at the direction of, Manager, or prior to an R&A Manager 
Event, R&A Sub-Manager, for payment of Manager Required Payments which 
exceed the Working Capital Peg Balance, not less frequently than on each 
Payment Date throughout the term of the Loan.
 
-64-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(g) If an R&A Manager Event has occurred, neither R&A Manager nor R&A 
Sub-Manager shall have any rights with respect to Manager Required 
Payments, the Working Capital Peg Balance or the right to direct 
disbursements from any of the Cash Management Account, the Property 
Accounts, the Operating Accounts or the FF&E Account. Borrower and 
Operating Lessee each acknowledges that the occurrence of a R&A Manager 
Event shall entitle the Lender to send an activation notice or similar 
instruction which terminates the R&A Manager and/or R&A Sub-Managers 
access to each of the Borrower Operating Account and the Borrower Property 
Account to the Operating Account Bank and/or the Property Bank, as 
applicable.

(h) Subject to Priority Waterfall Payments made pursuant to Section 3.4 of 
the Cash Management Agreement and Section 2.6.2(e) hereof, upon the 
occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, Lender may, 
in addition to any and all other rights and remedies available to Lender, 
apply any sums then present in each Cash Management Account to the payment 
of the Debt in any order in its sole discretion, subject to the terms of 
Section 7.10 of this Agreement.

(i) Each Property Account, the FF&E Account, each Operating Account and 
each Cash Management Account shall be an Eligible Account and the monies on 
deposit therein shall not be commingled with other monies held by Borrower, 
Operating Lessee, Manager, any R&A Manager, Property Bank, Agent, Operating 
Account Bank or FF&E Bank, as applicable.

(j) Neither Borrower nor Operating Lessee shall further pledge, assign or 
grant any security interest in either Property Account, the FF&E Account, 
either Operating Account or either Cash Management Account or the monies 
deposited therein or permit any lien or encumbrance to attach thereto, or 
any levy to be made thereon, or any UCC-1 Financing Statements, except 
those naming Lender as the secured party, to be filed with respect thereto.

(k) Borrower and Operating Lessee shall indemnify Lender and hold Lender 
harmless from and against any and all actions, suits, claims, demands, 
liabilities, losses, damages, obligations and costs and expenses (including 
litigation costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) arising from 
or in any way connected with either Property Account and/or either Property 
Account Agreement or with either Operating Account and/or either Operating 
Account Agreement (unless arising from the gross negligence or willful 
misconduct of Lender), the FF&E Account and/the applicable FF&E Account 
Agreement Account or the performance of the obligations for which either 
Property Account, the FF&E Account or either Operating Account were 
established.

2.6.2 Cash Management Accounts.

(a) Borrower has established and will maintain a segregated Eligible 
Account (the Borrower Cash Management Account) to be held by Agent in 
trust and for the benefit of Lender, which Borrower Cash Management Account 
shall be under the sole dominion and control of Lender. On or before the 
Operating Lease Effective Date, Operating Lessee will establish (and will 
thereafter maintain) a segregated Eligible Account (the Operating Lessee 
Cash Management Account; each of the Borrower Cash Management Account and 
the Operating Lessee Cash Management Account is sometimes referred to 
herein as a Cash
 
-65-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Management Account and, collectively, as the Cash Management Accounts) 
to be held by Agent in trust and for the benefit of Lender, which Operating 
Lessee Cash Management Account shall be under the sole dominion and control 
of Lender. Each Cash Management Account shall be entitled as set forth in 
the applicable Cash Management Agreement. Each of Borrower and Operating 
Lessee hereby grants to Lender a first priority security interest in the 
applicable Cash Management Account and all deposits at any time contained 
therein and the proceeds thereof and will take all actions necessary to 
maintain in favor of Lender a perfected first priority security interest in 
such Cash Management Account, including, without limitation, filing UCC-1 
Financing Statements and continuations thereof. Neither Borrower nor 
Operating Lessee will in any way alter or modify the applicable Cash 
Management Account, and Borrower and Operating Lessee (as applicable) will 
notify Lender of the account number thereof. Lender and Servicer shall have 
the sole right to make withdrawals from each Cash Management Account and 
all costs and expenses for establishing and maintaining each such Cash 
Management Account shall be paid by Borrower.

(b) The insufficiency of funds on deposit in either Cash Management Account 
shall not relieve Borrower from the obligation to make any payments, as and 
when due pursuant to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and such 
obligations shall be separate and independent, and not conditioned on any 
event or circumstance whatsoever.

(c) All funds on deposit in each Cash Management Account following the 
occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default may be applied 
by Lender pursuant to the terms of any Loan Document in such order and 
priority as Lender shall determine, subject to the terms of Sections 
2.6.2(e) and 7.10 of this Agreement and subject to payment of Priority 
Waterfall Payments.

(d) Borrower hereby agrees that Lender may modify either Cash Management 
Agreement (or both such Cash Management Agreements) for the purpose of 
establishing additional sub-accounts in connection with any payments 
otherwise required under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and 
Lender shall provide prior written notice thereof to Borrower and Operating 
Lessee no less than five (5) Business Days prior to such modification.

(e) Notwithstanding anything contained herein or in the other Loan 
Documents to the contrary, Lender agrees that, notwithstanding the 
existence of an Event of Default, Lender shall at all times (i) instruct 
Property Bank to transfer to each Operating Account (other than reasonable 
fees of the Property Bank as more particularly described in the applicable 
Property Account Agreement) in immediately available funds by federal wire 
transfer or ACH transfer all amounts on deposit in such Property Account 
(except for a reasonable peg balance established under the Property Account 
Agreement) not less than once every Business Day, (ii) intentionally 
omitted, (iii) instruct Operating Account Bank to (A) permit Manager, or 
prior to an R&A Manager Event, R&A Sub-Manager (without further notice or 
direction required from Lender) to access and draw upon the applicable 
Operating Account for the payment of Manager Required Payments and to 
maintain amounts in each such Operating Account equal to the then 
applicable Working Capital Peg Balance, (B) disburse funds from (1) prior 
to the consummation of the Restructuring, the Borrower Operating Account, 
and (2) from and after the consummation of the Restructuring, the Operating 
Lessee Operating Account to the FF&E Account in the amount of the 
Replacement Reserve Monthly Deposit, (C) intentionally omitted, and (D) 
transfer
 
-66-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
to each Cash Management Account, on each Payment Date, all amounts on 
deposit in either Operating Account that is not otherwise disbursed in 
accordance with the foregoing clauses (A) through (C) and (iv) during a 
Cash Trap Period, instruct Agent to apply amounts on deposit in the Cash 
Management Accounts to payment of the Priority Waterfall Payments (but 
without duplication of any such payments). During a Cash Trap Period, any 
amounts remaining in each Cash Management Account after payment of the 
Priority Waterfall Payments shall be deposited in the corresponding Excess 
Cash Flow Reserve Account on each Payment Date and applied in accordance 
with Section 7.5 hereof. Notwithstanding the existence of an Event of 
Default or any remedies that are undertaken by Lender in connection with an 
Event of Default (including any foreclosure action), Lender shall not have 
any right to apply any funds on deposit in either Operating Account to the 
Debt (or direct the Operating Account Bank to deliver any such funds to 
Lender, including any transfer of the same to the applicable Cash 
Management Account, other than as expressly provided in this Agreement), 
provided that the foregoing shall not otherwise affect Lenders right to 
apply funds that are properly transferred to either Cash Management Account 
to the Debt in accordance with Section 2.6.1(h). If no Debt Yield Trigger 
Period is then continuing, all amounts on deposit in (A) the Borrower Cash 
Management Account shall be disbursed to Borrower and (B) the Operating 
Lessee Cash Management Account shall be disbursed to Operating Lessee, in 
each case, on the Business Day immediately following the deposit thereof.

2.6.3 Payments Received Under the Cash Management Agreements. 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or the 
other Loan Documents, and provided no Event of Default has occurred and is 
continuing, Borrowers obligations with respect to the payment of the 
Monthly Debt Service Payment Amount and amounts required to be deposited 
into the Reserve Accounts, if any, shall be deemed satisfied to the extent 
sufficient amounts are deposited in either Cash Management Account to 
satisfy such obligations pursuant to this Agreement and such Cash 
Management Agreement on the dates each such payment is required, regardless 
of whether any of such amounts are so applied by Lender.

Section 2.7 Withholding Taxes.

(a) Payments Free of Taxes. Any and all payments by or on account of any 
obligation of Borrower under any Loan Document shall be made without 
deduction or withholding for any Section 2.7 Taxes, except as required by 
applicable law. If any applicable law (as determined in the good faith 
discretion of Borrower) requires the deduction or withholding of any 
Section 2.7 Tax from any such payment by or on account of any obligation of 
Borrower, then Borrower shall be entitled to make such deduction or 
withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to 
the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law and, 
if such Section 2.7 Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by 
Borrower shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or 
withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings 
applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.7) the Lender or 
Servicer (as applicable) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have 
received had no such deduction or withholding been made. For the purposes 
of this Section 2.7, the term applicable law shall include FATCA.

(b) Payment of Other Taxes by Borrower. Borrower shall timely pay to the 
relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law any Other 
Taxes.
 
-67-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(c) Indemnification by Borrower. Borrower shall indemnify Lender and any 
Servicer, within ten (10) days after demand therefor, for the full amount 
of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted 
on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) payable or paid 
by such Lender or Servicer or required to be withheld or deducted from a 
payment to such Lender or Servicer and any reasonable expenses arising 
therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes 
were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental 
Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability 
delivered to Borrower by a Lender or the Servicer (either for its own 
account or for the account of a Lender) shall be conclusive absent manifest 
error.

(d) Evidence of Payments. As soon as practicable after any payment of 
Section 2.7 Taxes by Borrower to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this 
Section 2.7, Borrower shall deliver to the Lender or any Servicer the 
original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental 
Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such 
payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the 
Lender or any Servicer.

(e) Status of Lenders. (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from 
or reduction of withholding Section 2.7 Tax with respect to payments made 
under any Loan Document shall deliver to Borrower and any Servicer, at the 
time or times reasonably requested by Borrower or the Servicer (as 
applicable), such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably 
requested by Borrower or the Servicer (as applicable) as will permit such 
payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of 
withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by Borrower, 
shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or 
reasonably requested by Borrower or any Servicer as will enable Borrower or 
the Servicer (as applicable) to determine whether or not such Lender is 
subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, 
the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than 
such documentation set forth in Section 2.7(e)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) 
below) shall not be required if in the Lenders reasonable judgment such 
completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any 
material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the 
legal or commercial position of such Lender.

(ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,

(A) any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to Borrower and any 
Servicer on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender 
under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable 
request of Borrower or the Servicer (as applicable)), executed copies of 
IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup 
withholding tax;

(B) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do 
so, deliver to Borrower and any Servicer (in such number of copies as shall 
be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such 
Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time 
thereafter upon the reasonable request of Borrower or the Servicer (as 
applicable)), whichever of the following is applicable:
 
-68-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax 
treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments 
of interest under any Loan Document, executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or 
IRS Form W-8BEN-E (as applicable) establishing an exemption from, or 
reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Section 2.7 Tax pursuant to the 
interest article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other 
applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form 
W-8BEN-E (as applicable) establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, 
U.S. federal withholding Section 2.7 Tax pursuant to the business profits 
or other income article of such tax treaty;

(2) executed copies of IRS Form W-8ECI;

(3) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption 
for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate 
substantially in the form of Exhibit A-1 to the effect that such Foreign 
Lender is not a bank within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the 
Code, a 10 percent shareholder of Borrower within the meaning of Section 
881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a controlled foreign corporation described 
in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate) 
and (y) executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E (as 
applicable); or

(4) to the extent a Foreign Lender is a partnership or is not the 
beneficial owner, executed copies of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS 
Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E (as applicable), a U.S. 
Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit A-2 or 
Exhibit A-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each 
beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a 
partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign 
Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender 
may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of 
Exhibit A 4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner;

(C) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do 
so, deliver to Borrower and any Servicer (in such number of copies as shall 
be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such 
Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time 
thereafter upon the reasonable request of Borrower or the Servicer (as 
applicable)), executed copies of any other form prescribed by applicable 
law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal 
withholding Section 2.7 Tax, duly completed, together with such 
supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to 
permit Borrower or the Servicer (as applicable) to determine the 
withholding or deduction required to be made; and
 
-69-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(D) if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject 
to U.S. federal withholding Section 2.7 Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender 
were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA 
(including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as 
applicable), such Lender shall deliver to Borrower and any Servicer at the 
time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably 
requested by Borrower or the Servicer (as applicable) such documentation 
prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 
1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably 
requested by Borrower or the Servicer (as applicable) as may be necessary 
for Borrower or the Servicer (as applicable) to comply with their 
obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with 
such Lenders obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct 
and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (D), 
FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this 
Agreement.

Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously 
delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it 
shall update such form or certification or promptly notify Borrower in 
writing of its legal inability to do so. If a Servicer is appointed 
pursuant to Section 9.5, such Servicer shall be subject to the requirements 
of this Section 2.7(e) as if it were a Lender.

(f) Treatment of Certain Refunds. If any party determines, in its sole 
discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any 
Section 2.7 Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this 
Section 2.7 (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to 
this Section 2.7), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal 
to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under 
this Section with respect to the Section 2.7 Taxes giving rise to such 
refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Section 2.7 Taxes) of 
such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid 
by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund). Such 
indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay 
to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this paragraph 
(f) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant 
Governmental Authority) in the event that such indemnified party is 
required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (f), in no event 
will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying 
party pursuant to this paragraph (f) the payment of which would place the 
indemnified party in a less favorable net after-tax position than the 
indemnified party would have been in if the Section 2.7 Tax subject to 
indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, 
withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or 
additional amounts with respect to such Section 2.7 Tax had never been 
paid. This paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified 
party to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating 
to its Section 2.7 Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying 
party or any other Person.

(g) Survival. Each partys obligations under this Section 2.7 shall survive 
any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender or Servicer 
and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any 
Loan Document.
 
-70-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(h) Lender hereby agrees that, upon the occurrence of any circumstances 
entitling Lender to additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.7, Lender 
shall use reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal 
and regulatory restrictions) to designate a different applicable lending 
office for the receipt of payments with respect to, or the funding or 
booking of, its Loan hereunder, if, in the reasonable judgment of such 
Lender, such designation (i) would eliminate or reduce such additional 
amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.7 in the future, and (ii) would not 
subject such lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not 
otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. Borrower hereby agrees to pay 
all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with 
such designation.

Section 2.8 Defeasance.

2.8.1 Voluntary Defeasance.

(a) Provided no Event of Default shall then exist, Borrower shall have the 
right, on any Payment Date occurring at any time after the Permitted 
Release Date and prior to the Yield Maintenance End Date, to voluntarily

Loan by and upon satisfaction of the following conditions (such event being 
a Defeasance Event):

(i) Borrower shall provide not less than thirty (30) days prior written 
notice to Lender specifying the Payment Date (the Defeasance Date) on 
which the Defeasance Event is to occur;

(ii) Borrower shall pay to Lender all accrued and unpaid interest on the 
principal balance of the Loan to and including the Defeasance Date. If 
Lender agrees to accept a Defeasance Date that is not a Payment Date 
notwithstanding the requirement in this Section 2.8.1(a) that a Defeasance 
Event occur on a Payment Date, Borrower shall also pay interest that would 
have accrued on the Note through and including the next Payment Date, 
provided, however, if the Defeasance Deposit shall include (or if the U.S. 
Obligations purchased with such Defeasance Deposit shall provide for 
payment of) all principal and interest computed from the Payment Date prior 
to the Defeasance Date through the next succeeding Payment Date, Borrower 
shall not be required to pay such short term interest pursuant to this 
sentence;

(iii) Borrower shall pay to Lender all other sums, not including scheduled 
interest or principal payments, then due under the Note, this Agreement, 
the Mortgage and the other Loan Documents;

(iv) Borrower shall pay to Lender the required Defeasance Deposit for the 
Defeasance Event;

(v) Borrower shall execute and deliver a pledge and security agreement, in 
form and substance that would be reasonably satisfactory to a prudent 
lender creating a first priority lien on the Defeasance Deposit and the 
U.S. Obligations purchased with the Defeasance Deposit in accordance with 
the provisions of this Section 2.8.1 (the Security Agreement);
 
-71-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(vi) Borrower shall deliver an opinion from counsel reasonably satisfactory 
to Lender that is standard in commercial lending transactions and subject 
only to customary qualifications, assumptions and exceptions opining, among 
other things, that Borrower has legally and validly transferred and 
assigned the U.S. Obligations and all obligations, rights and duties under 
and to the Note to the Successor Borrower, that Lender has a perfected 
first priority security interest in the Defeasance Deposit and the U.S. 
Obligations delivered by Borrower and that any REMIC Trust formed pursuant 
to a Securitization will not fail to maintain its status as a real estate 
mortgage investment conduit within the meaning of Section 860D of the Code 
as a result of such Defeasance Event;

(vii) Borrower shall deliver a Rating Agency Confirmation, and, if required 
by the applicable Approved Rating Agencies, Borrower shall also deliver or 
cause to be delivered an Additional Insolvency Opinion with respect to the 
Successor Borrower;

(viii) Borrower shall deliver an Officers Certificate certifying that the 
requirements set forth in this Section 2.8.1(a) have been satisfied;

(ix) Borrower shall deliver a certificate of Borrowers independent 
certified public accountant or another national recognized accounting firm 
acceptable to Lender in its reasonable discretion, certifying that the U.S. 
Obligations purchased with the Defeasance Deposit generate monthly amounts 
equal to or greater than the Scheduled Defeasance Payments;

(x) Borrower shall deliver such other certificates, documents or 
instruments as Lender may reasonably request; and

(xi) Borrower shall pay all reasonable, actual out-of-pocket costs and 
expenses of Lender incurred in connection with the Defeasance Event, 
including (A) any costs and expenses associated with a release of the Lien 
of the Mortgage(s) as provided in Section 2.5.1 hereof, (B) reasonable 
attorneys fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Defeasance 
Event, (C) the costs and expenses of the Approved Rating Agencies, (D) any 
revenue, documentary stamp or intangible taxes or any other tax or charge 
due in connection with the transfer of the Note, or otherwise required to 
accomplish the defeasance and (E) the costs and expenses of Servicer and 
any trustee, including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses.

(b) In connection with the Defeasance Event, Lender shall, at Borrowers 
direction use the Defeasance Deposit on behalf of Borrower (and Borrower 
authorizes Lender to so use the Defeasance Deposit) to purchase U.S. 
Obligations which provide payments on or prior to, but as close as possible 
to, all successive scheduled Payment Dates after the Defeasance Date upon 
which interest and, if applicable, principal payments are required under 
this Agreement and the Note, and in amounts equal to or more than the 
scheduled payments due on such Payment Dates under this Agreement and the 
Note (including, without limitation, scheduled payments of interest, 
servicing fees (if any), and any other amounts due under the Loan Documents 
on such Payment Dates) and assuming the outstanding principal balance of 
the Note is prepaid in full on the Yield Maintenance End Date (the 
Scheduled Defeasance Payments). Borrower, pursuant
 
-72-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
to the Security Agreement or other appropriate document, shall authorize 
and direct that the payments received from the U.S. Obligations shall be 
made directly to the Operating Lessee Cash Management Account or, if the 
Operating Lessee Cash Management Account is not yet opened, the Borrower 
Cash Management Account (in each case, unless otherwise directed by 
Lender), and applied to satisfy the Debt Service obligations of Borrower 
under this Agreement and the Note. Any portion of the Defeasance Deposit in 
excess of the amount necessary to purchase the U.S. Obligations required by 
this Section 2.8.1 and satisfy Borrowers other obligations under this 
Section 2.8.1 shall be remitted to Borrower.

2.8.2 Collateral. Each of the U.S. Obligations that are part of the 
defeasance collateral shall be duly endorsed by the holder thereof as 
directed by Lender or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in 
form and substance that would be satisfactory to a prudent lender 
(including, without limitation, such instruments as may be required by the 
depository institution holding such securities or by the issuer thereof, as 
the case may be, to effectuate book-entry transfers and pledges through the 
book-entry facilities of such institution) in order to perfect upon the 
delivery of the defeasance collateral a first priority security interest 
therein in favor of Lender in conformity with all applicable state and 
federal laws governing the granting of such security interests.

2.8.3 Successor Borrower. In connection with any Defeasance Event, Borrower 
shall establish or designate a successor entity (the Successor Borrower) 
acceptable to Lender in its reasonable discretion, which shall be a Special 
Purpose Entity, which shall not own any other assets or have any other 
liabilities or operate other property (except in connection with other 
defeased loans held in the same securitized loan pool with the Loan). 
Borrower shall transfer and assign all obligations, rights and duties under 
and to the Note, together with the pledged U.S. Obligations to such 
Successor Borrower. Such Successor Borrower shall assume the obligations 
under the Note and the Security Agreement and Borrower shall be relieved of 
its obligations under such documents. Borrower shall pay $1,000 to any such 
Successor Borrower as consideration for assuming the obligations under the 
Note and the Security Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement 
to the contrary, no other assumption fee shall be payable upon a transfer 
of the Note in accordance with this Section 2.8.3.

Section 2.9 Reconstitution of Legal Description of Property. Upon the 
written request of Borrower, Lender will reasonably cooperate with Borrower 
in connection with any reconstitution of the legal description of the 
Property (including a consolidation and re-subdivision of all or any part 
of the Property) requested by Borrower, provided that Lender may impose 
such reasonable conditions with respect thereto as shall be necessary in 
order to maintain and confirm the first priority Lien of the Mortgage upon 
the Property, after giving effect to such reconstitution, including, 
without limitation, (i) the execution and recording or filing (as 
applicable), at Borrowers sole cost and expense, of such amendments to the 
Mortgage and any UCC financing statements with respect to the Property as 
shall be required in order to so maintain the first priority Lien of the 
Mortgage upon the Property after giving effect to such reconstitution and 
(ii) the delivery by Borrower, at its sole cost and expense, of (A) an 
endorsement to the Title Insurance Policy, insuring that the Mortgage 
creates a valid first priority lien on the Property (after giving effect to 
such reconstitution) and that the Property shall not be subject to any 
additional exceptions or liens other than those contained in the Title 
Insurance Policy and any other Permitted Encumbrances (B) an update of the 
Survey of the Property
 
-73-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
reflecting that Property subject to the Lien of the Mortgage, after giving 
effect to such reconstitution, is identical to the Property subject to the 
Lien of the Mortgage as of the Closing Date (after taking into account any 
prior release of the Taran Outparcel or Release Parcels).


ARTICLE III

CONDITIONS PRECEDENT

Section 3.1 Conditions Precedent to Closing. The obligation of Lender to 
make the Loan hereunder is subject to the fulfillment by Borrower or waiver 
by Lender of all of the conditions precedent to closing set forth in the 
application or term sheet for the Loan delivered by Borrower to Lender and 
the commitment or commitment rider, if any, to the application or term 
sheet for the Loan issued by Lender, and each such condition precedent 
shall be deemed to have been so satisfied or waived upon the making of the 
Loan by Lender to Borrower.


ARTICLE IV

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

Section 4.1 Borrower Representations. Each of Borrower and Operating 
Lessee, where applicable, represents and warrants as of the Closing Date 
that:

4.1.1 Organization. Borrower and Operating Lessee has been duly organized 
and is validly existing and in good standing with requisite power and 
authority to own or lease (as applicable) the Property and to transact the 
businesses in which it is now engaged. Each of Borrower and Operating 
Lessee is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in each 
jurisdiction where it is required to be so qualified in connection with its 
businesses and operations. Each of Borrower and Operating Lessee possesses 
all rights, licenses, permits and authorizations, governmental or 
otherwise, necessary to entitle it to own the Property and to transact the 
businesses in which it is now engaged, other than to the extent the failure 
to do so does not result, and is not reasonably likely to result, in a 
Material Adverse Effect. The sole business of Borrower and Operating Lessee 
is the ownership or leasing (as applicable), management and operation of 
the Property or the Leased Property (as applicable). The ownership 
interests in Borrower and Operating Lessee are as set forth on the 
organizational chart attached hereto as Schedule 4.1.1.

4.1.2 Proceedings. Each of Borrower and Operating Lessee has taken all 
necessary action to authorize its execution, delivery and performance of 
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which it is a party. This 
Agreement and such other applicable Loan Documents have been duly executed 
and delivered by or on behalf of Borrower and Operating Lessee and 
constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of Borrower and Operating 
Lessee, enforceable against Borrower and Operating Lessee in accordance 
with their respective terms, subject only to applicable bankruptcy, 
insolvency and similar laws affecting rights of creditors generally, and 
subject, as to enforceability, to general principles of equity (regardless 
of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or at law).
 
-74-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.1.3 No Conflicts. The execution, delivery and performance of this 
Agreement and the other applicable Loan Documents by Borrower and Operating 
Lessee will not conflict with or result in a breach of any of the terms or 
provisions of, or constitute a default under, or result in the creation or 
imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance (other than pursuant to the 
Loan Documents) upon any of the property or assets of Borrower or Operating 
Lessee pursuant to the terms of any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, 
loan agreement, partnership agreement, management agreement or other 
agreement or instrument to which Borrower or Operating Lessee is a party or 
by which any of Borrowers or Operating Lessees property or assets are 
subject (unless consents from all applicable parties thereto have been 
obtained), nor will such action, to Borrowers knowledge, result in any 
violation of the provisions of any statute or any order, rule or regulation 
of any Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over Borrower or 
Operating Lessee or any of Borrowers or Operating Lessees properties or 
assets, and any consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or 
qualification of or with any court or any such Governmental Authority 
required for the execution, delivery and performance by Borrower or 
Operating Lessee of this Agreement or any other Loan Documents has been 
obtained and is in full force and effect.

4.1.4 Litigation. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.1.4 attached hereto, 
there are no actions, suits or proceedings at law or in equity by or before 
any Governmental Authority or other agency now pending or to Borrowers 
knowledge, threatened against or affecting Borrower, Operating Lessee, any 
Principal or the Property, which actions, suits or proceedings, if 
determined against Borrower, Operating Lessee, Principal or the Property, 
would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

4.1.5 Agreements. Neither Borrower nor Operating Lessee is a party to any 
agreement or instrument or subject to any restriction which has, or would 
reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect. Neither Borrower 
nor Operating Lessee is in default in any material respect in the 
performance, observance or fulfillment of any of the obligations, covenants 
or conditions contained in any material agreement or instrument to which it 
is a party or by which Borrower, Operating Lessee or the Property is bound. 
Neither Borrower nor Operating Lessee has any material financial obligation 
under any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement or other 
agreement or instrument to which Borrower or Operating Lessee is a party or 
by which Borrower, Operating Lessee or the Property is otherwise bound, 
other than (a) obligations incurred in the ordinary course of the operation 
of the Property as permitted pursuant to clause (xxiii) of the definition 
of Special Purpose Entity set forth in Section 1.1 hereof, (b) 
obligations under the Loan Documents and (c) Permitted Encumbrances.

4.1.6 Title. Borrower has good, marketable and insurable title to the real 
property (or a leasehold estate as it relates to the Ground Leased 
Property) comprising part of the Property and good title to the personal 
property and Improvements that constitute the balance of the Property, free 
and clear of all Liens whatsoever except the Permitted Encumbrances, such 
other Liens as are permitted pursuant to the Loan Documents and the Liens 
created by the Loan Documents. As of the Operating Lease Effective Date, 
Operating Lessee will have good and marketable title to the leasehold 
interest with respect the real property comprising part of the Leased 
Property and good title to the personal property and Improvements that 
constitute the balance of the Leased Property and that are not otherwise 
owned by Borrower. The Permitted Encumbrances in the aggregate do not have 
a Material Adverse Effect. The Mortgage, when
 
-75-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
properly recorded in the appropriate records, together with any Uniform 
Commercial Code financing statements required to be filed in connection 
therewith, will create (a) a valid, perfected first priority lien on 
Borrowers and Operating Lessees respective interests in the Property, 
subject only to Permitted Encumbrances and the Liens created by the Loan 
Documents and (b) perfected security interests in and to, and perfected 
collateral assignments of, all personalty (including the Leases), to the 
extent a security interest may be perfected therein by the recording of the 
Mortgage or the filing of financing statements under the Uniform Commercial 
Code, all in accordance with the terms thereof, in each case subject only 
to any applicable Permitted Encumbrances, such other Liens as are permitted 
pursuant to the Loan Documents and the Liens created by the Loan Documents. 
To Borrowers knowledge, there are no claims for payment for work, labor or 
materials affecting the Property which are a Lien prior to, or of equal 
priority with, the Liens created by the Loan Documents and as to which 
Lender has not otherwise received affirmative insurance in the applicable 
Title Insurance Policy (in form and substance satisfactory to Lender in all 
respects).

4.1.7 Solvency. Neither Borrower nor Operating Lessee has entered into this 
transaction or executed this Agreement or any other applicable Loan 
Document with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud any creditor 
and Borrower and Operating Lessee has received reasonably equivalent value 
in exchange for its obligations under such Loan Documents. After giving 
effect to the Loan, the fair saleable value of the assets of Borrower and 
Operating Lessee, in the aggregate exceed and will, immediately following 
the making of the Loan, exceed the total liabilities of Borrower and 
Operating Lessee, in the aggregate, including, without limitation, 
subordinated, unliquidated, disputed and contingent liabilities. The fair 
saleable value of the assets of Borrower and Operating Lessee is and will, 
immediately following the making of the Loan, be greater than the probable 
liabilities of Borrower and Operating Lessee, in the aggregate, including 
the maximum amount of its contingent liabilities on its debts as such debts 
become absolute and matured. The assets of Borrower and Operating Lessee do 
not and, immediately following the making of the Loan will not, constitute 
unreasonably small capital to carry out its business as conducted or as 
proposed to be conducted. Neither Borrower nor Operating Lessee intends to, 
nor does it believe that it will, incur debt and liabilities (including 
contingent liabilities and other commitments) beyond its ability to pay 
such debt and liabilities as they mature (taking into account the timing 
and amounts of cash to be received by Borrower or Operating Lessee and the 
amounts to be payable on or in respect of obligations of Borrower or 
Operating Lessee). No petition in bankruptcy has been filed against 
Borrower, Operating Lessee or any of their respective constituent Persons 
in the last seven (7) years, and none of Borrower, Operating Lessee or any 
constituent Person in the last seven (7) years has ever made an assignment 
for the benefit of creditors or taken advantage of any insolvency act for 
the benefit of debtors. None of Borrower, Operating Lessee, or any of their 
respective constituent Persons are contemplating either the filing of a 
petition by it under any state or federal bankruptcy or insolvency laws or 
the liquidation of all or a major portion of Borrowers or Operating 
Lessees assets or property, and Borrower has no knowledge of any Person 
contemplating the filing of any such petition against it, Operating Lessee 
or such constituent Persons.

4.1.8 Full and Accurate Disclosure. No statement of fact made by Borrower 
or Operating Lessee in this Agreement or in any of the other Loan Documents 
contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any 
material fact necessary to make statements contained herein or therein not 
misleading. There is no material fact presently known to Borrower which has 
not been disclosed to Lender which has, nor as far as Borrower can 
reasonably foresee, would be reasonably likely to have, a Material Adverse 
Effect.
 
-76-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.1.9 No Plan Assets. As of the date of this Agreement, none of Borrower, 
Operating Lessee or Guarantor is an employee benefit plan, as defined in 
Section 3(3) of ERISA, whether or not subject to Title I of ERISA, and none 
of the respective assets of Borrower, Operating Lessee or Guarantor 
constitute or will constitute plan assets of any benefit plan investor 
within the meaning of 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101 as modified by Section 
3(42) of ERISA (the Plan Asset Regulations). Except as could not 
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, none of Borrower, 
Operating Lessee, Guarantor or any ERISA Affiliate is obligated to 
contribute to any employee benefit plan (as so defined) subject to Title IV 
of ERISA. Transactions contemplated hereunder by or with Borrower, 
Operating Lessee or Guarantor are not subject to any state or other statute 
or regulation with respect to governmental plans within the meaning of 
Section 3(32) of ERISA which are substantially similar to the prohibited 
transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code 
currently in effect and which prohibit the transactions contemplated by 
this Agreement, including, but not limited to the exercise by Lender of any 
of its rights under the Loan Documents. No ERISA Event has occurred and to 
Borrowers knowledge no ERISA Event is reasonably likely to occur.

4.1.10 Compliance. Borrower, Operating Lessee and the Property and the use 
thereof comply in all material respects with all applicable Legal 
Requirements, including, without limitation, building and zoning ordinances 
and codes. Neither Borrower nor Operating Lessee is in default or violation 
of any order, writ, injunction, decree or demand of any Governmental 
Authority. There has not been committed by Borrower or Operating Lessee or 
to the best of Borrowers knowledge, any other Person in occupancy of or 
involved with the operation or use of the Property any act or omission 
affording the federal government or any other Governmental Authority the 
right of forfeiture as against the Property or any part thereof or any 
monies paid in performance of Borrowers obligations under any of the Loan 
Documents.

4.1.11 Financial Information. All financial data, including, without 
limitation, the statements of cash flow and income and operating expense, 
that have been delivered to Lender in connection with the Loan (i) are 
true, complete and correct in all material respects (or to the extent that 
any such financial data was incorrect in any material respect when 
delivered, the same have been corrected by financial data subsequently 
delivered to Lender prior to the Closing Date in writing and containing an 
express reference to any and all such concerns), (ii) fairly represent the 
financial condition of Borrower, Operating Lessee and the Property, as 
applicable, as of the date of such reports, and (iii) to the extent 
prepared or audited by an independent certified public accounting firm, 
have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, as interpreted by the Uniform 
System of Accounts, throughout the periods covered, except as disclosed 
therein. The foregoing representation shall not apply to any such financial 
data that constitutes projections, provided that Borrower represents and 
warrants that such projections were made in good faith and that Borrower 
has no reason to believe that such projections are materially inaccurate. 
Except for Permitted Encumbrances, neither Borrower nor Operating Lessee 
has contingent liabilities, liabilities for taxes, unusual forward or long 
term commitments or unrealized or anticipated losses from any unfavorable 
commitments that are known to Borrower and are reasonably likely to have a 
Material Adverse Effect, except as referred to or
 
-77-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
reflected in said financial statements. Since the date of such financial 
statements, there has been no materially adverse change in the financial 
condition, operations or business of Borrower or Operating Lessee, from 
that set forth in said financial statements.

4.1.12 Condemnation. No Condemnation or other similar proceeding has been 
commenced or, to the best of Borrowers knowledge, is threatened or 
contemplated with respect to all or any portion of the Property or for the 
relocation of roadways providing access to the Property, other than to the 
extent the same would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse 
Effect.

4.1.13 Federal Reserve Regulations. No part of the proceeds of the Loan 
will be used for the purpose of purchasing or acquiring any margin stock 
within the meaning of Regulation U of the Board of Governors of the Federal 
Reserve System or for any other purpose which would be inconsistent with 
such Regulation U or any other Regulations of such Board of Governors, or 
for any purposes prohibited by Legal Requirements or by the terms and 
conditions of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents.

4.1.14 Utilities and Public Access. Except as set forth in the Title 
Insurance Policy or except to the extent that there is no Material Adverse 
Effect, (i) the Property has rights of access to public ways and is served 
by water, sewer, sanitary sewer and storm drain facilities adequate to 
service the Property for its intended uses; (ii) all public utilities 
necessary or convenient to the full use and enjoyment of the Property are 
located either in the public right of way abutting the Property (which are 
connected so as to serve the Property without passing over other property) 
or in recorded easements serving the Property and such easements are set 
forth in and insured by the Title Insurance Policy; and (iii) all roads 
necessary for the use of the Property for its current purposes have been 
completed and dedicated to public use and accepted by all Governmental 
Authorities.

4.1.15 Not a Foreign Person. Neither Borrower nor Operating Lessee (or if 
such entity is a disregarded entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes, 
such entitys beneficial owner) is a foreign person within the meaning of 
§ 1445(f)(3) of the Code.

4.1.16 Separate Lots. Except as set forth in the Title Insurance Policy, 
the Property is comprised of one (1) or more parcels which constitute a 
separate tax lot or lots and does not constitute a portion of any other tax 
lot not a part of the Property.

4.1.17 Assessments. Except as set forth in the Title Insurance Policy, to 
Borrowers knowledge, there are no pending or proposed special or other 
assessments for public improvements or otherwise affecting the Property, 
nor are there any contemplated improvements to the Property that may result 
in such special or other assessments.

4.1.18 Enforceability. The Loan Documents are enforceable by Lender (or any 
subsequent holder thereof) in accordance with their respective terms, 
subject to principles of equity and bankruptcy, insolvency and other laws 
generally applicable to creditors rights and the enforcement of debtors 
obligations. The Loan Documents are not subject to any right of rescission, 
set off, counterclaim or defense by Borrower, Operating Lessee or 
Guarantor, including the defense of usury, nor would the operation of any 
of the terms of the Loan
 
-78-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Documents, or the exercise of any right thereunder, render the Loan 
Documents unenforceable (subject to principles of equity and bankruptcy, 
insolvency and other laws generally affecting creditors rights and the 
enforcement of debtors obligations), and none of Borrower, Operating 
Lessee or Guarantor has asserted any right of rescission, set off, 
counterclaim or defense with respect thereto.

4.1.19 No Prior Assignment. There are no prior assignments of the Leases or 
any portion of the Rents due and payable or to become due and payable which 
are presently outstanding.

4.1.20 Insurance. Borrower has obtained and has delivered to Lender 
certified copies of, or certificates with respect to, the Policies 
reflecting the insurance coverages, amounts and other requirements set 
forth in this Agreement. No claims have been made or are currently pending, 
outstanding or otherwise remain unsatisfied under any such Policy and would 
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, and none of 
Borrower, Operating Lessee or any other Person, has done, by act or 
omission, anything which would impair the coverage of any such Policy.

4.1.21 Use of Property. The Property is used exclusively for hotel and 
other appurtenant and related uses.

4.1.22 Certificate of Occupancy; Licenses. All certifications, permits, 
licenses and approvals, including without limitation, certificates of 
completion and occupancy permits and any applicable liquor license required 
for the legal use, occupancy and operation of the Property as a hotel 
(collectively, the Licenses), have been obtained and are in full force 
and effect, except for where the failure to obtain such licenses or for 
such licenses to not be in full force and effect does not have a Material 
Adverse Effect. Borrower, Operating Lessee, Manager or any R&A Manager (as 
applicable) shall keep and maintain all Licenses necessary for the 
operation of the Property as a hotel, except to the extent the failure to 
have such licenses would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material 
Adverse Effect. The use being made of the Property is in conformity in all 
material respects with the certificate of occupancy, if any, issued for the 
Property.

4.1.23 Flood Zone. Except as set forth in the Survey or the flood 
determinations obtained by Lender, none of the Improvements on the Property 
are located in an area as identified by the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency as an area having special flood hazards and, if so located, the 
flood insurance required pursuant to Section 6.1(a)(i) is in full force and 
effect with respect to the Property.

4.1.24 Physical Condition. Except if the same do not, in the aggregate, 
have a Material Adverse Effect, and except as disclosed in the Property 
Report, to Borrowers knowledge, (i) the Property, including, without 
limitation, all buildings, improvements, parking facilities, sidewalks, 
storm drainage systems, roofs, plumbing systems, HVAC systems, fire 
protection systems, electrical systems, equipment, elevators, exterior 
sidings and doors, landscaping, irrigation systems and all structural 
components thereon, are in good condition, order and repair in all material 
respects; and (ii) there exists no structural or other material defects or 
damages in the Property, whether latent or otherwise, and neither Borrower 
nor
 
-79-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operating Lessee has received notice from any insurance company or bonding 
company of any defects or inadequacies in the Property, or any part 
thereof, which have not been remedied prior to the Closing Date and would 
adversely affect the insurability of the same or cause the imposition of 
extraordinary premiums or charges thereon or of any termination or 
threatened termination of any policy of insurance or bond.

4.1.25 Boundaries. Except as set forth in the Survey, all of the 
improvements which were included in determining the appraised value of the 
Property lie wholly within the boundaries and building restriction lines of 
the Property, and no improvements on adjoining properties encroach upon the 
Property, and no easements or other encumbrances upon the Property encroach 
upon any of the Improvements, in each case, so as to result in a Material 
Adverse Effect, except those which are insured against by the Title 
Insurance Policy.

4.1.26 Leases. To Borrowers knowledge, the Property is not subject to any 
Material Lease and, to Borrowers knowledge, the rent roll with respect to 
the Property and attached hereto as Schedule 4.1.26 is true, complete and 
accurate in all material respects as of the Closing Date. Borrower or 
Operating Lessee is the owner and lessor of landlords interest in the 
Leases. To Borrowers knowledge, (i) with the exception of hotel guests and 
patrons, no Person has any possessory interest in the Property or right to 
occupy the same except under and pursuant to the provisions of the Leases, 
(ii) the current Material Leases are in full force and effect and Borrower 
has not received or delivered written notice that either party is in 
default under a Material Lease except for (A) defaults which have been 
cured and (B) defaults that do not, in the aggregate for the Property, have 
a Material Adverse Effect. No Rent has been paid more than one (1) month in 
advance of its due date (except with respect to provision of rooms and 
banquet and meeting space and services in the ordinary course of business). 
All work to be performed by Borrower under each Material Lease has been 
performed as required in all material respects and has been accepted by the 
applicable Tenant, and any payments, free rent, partial rent, rebate of 
rent or other payments, credits, allowances or abatements required to be 
given by Borrower to any Tenant has already been received by such Tenant. 
To Borrowers knowledge, except as described on Schedule 4.1.26, no Tenant 
under a Material Lease has assigned its Lease or sublet all or any portion 
of the premises demised thereby, no such Tenant holds its leased premises 
under assignment or sublease, nor does anyone except such Tenant and its 
employees occupy such leased premises. No Tenant under any Lease has a 
right or option pursuant to such Lease or otherwise to purchase all or any 
part of the leased premises or the building of which the leased premises 
are a part and no tenant under any Lease has any right or option for 
additional space in the Improvements.

4.1.27 Survey. To Borrowers knowledge, the Survey does not fail to reflect 
any material matter affecting the Property or the title thereto.

4.1.28 Inventory. Borrower (and/or Operating Lessee on and following the 
Operating Lease Effective Date) is the owner of all of the Equipment, 
Fixtures and Personal Property. All of the Equipment, Fixtures and Personal 
Property are sufficient to operate the Property in the manner required 
hereunder and in the manner in which the same is currently operated.
 
-80-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.1.29 Filing and Recording Taxes. All mortgage, mortgage recording, stamp, 
intangible or other similar tax required to be paid by any Person under 
applicable Legal Requirements currently in effect in connection with the 
execution, delivery, recordation, filing, registration, perfection or 
enforcement of any of the Loan Documents, including, without limitation, 
the Mortgage, have been paid, and, under current Legal Requirements, the 
Mortgage is enforceable in accordance with its terms by Lender (or any 
subsequent holder thereof), subject to principles of equity and bankruptcy, 
insolvency and other laws generally applicable to creditors rights and the 
enforcement of debtors obligations.

4.1.30 Special Purpose Entity/Separateness. (a) Each of Borrower, Operating 
Lessee and Principal is a Special Purpose Entity.

(b) Intentionally Omitted.

(c) Any and all of the stated facts and assumptions made in any Insolvency 
Opinion, including, but not limited to, any exhibits attached thereto, will 
have been true and correct in all respects, and Borrower, Operating Lessee 
and Principal, will have complied with all of the stated facts and 
assumptions made with respect to it in any Insolvency Opinion, in each case 
as of the date of such Insolvency Opinion. To Borrowers knowledge, each 
entity other than Borrower, Operating Lessee and Principal with respect to 
which an assumption is made or a fact stated in any Insolvency Opinion will 
have complied with all of the assumptions made and facts stated with 
respect to it in any such Insolvency Opinion, in each case as of the date 
of such Insolvency Opinion.

(d) Borrower and Operating Lessee each hereby represents with respect to 
itself and Borrower hereby represents as to Principal that any amendment or 
restatement of any organizational document has been accomplished in 
accordance with, and was permitted by, the relevant provisions of such 
document prior to its amendment or restatement from time to time.

(e) Borrower and Operating Lessee each hereby represents with respect to 
itself and Borrower hereby represents as to Principal that, with respect to 
the period prior to the Closing Date, it:

Thereafter, the Ground Lease is further assignable by such transferee and

Borrower under the terms of the Ground Lease or (ii) to Borrowers 
knowledge, a default by Ground Lessor under the terms of the Ground Lease.

operation or use of the Property to commit any act or omission affording 
the federal government or any state or local government the right of 
forfeiture against the Property or any part thereof or any monies paid in 
performance of Borrowers obligations under any of the Loan Documents. Each 
of Borrower and Operating Lessee hereby covenants and agrees not to commit, 
permit or suffer to exist any act or omission affording such right of 
forfeiture. Each of Borrower and Operating Lessee shall at all times 
maintain, preserve and protect all rights it has in necessary franchises

useful in the conduct of its business and shall keep the Property in good 
working order and repair, and from time to time make, or cause to be made,

improvements thereto, all as more fully provided in the Loan Documents. 
Borrower and/or Operating Lessee shall keep the Property insured at all 
times by financially sound and reputable insurers, to such extent and 
against such risks, and maintain liability and such other insurance, as is 
more fully provided in this Agreement. After prior written notice to 
Lender, Borrower or Operating Lessee, at its own expense, may contest by 
appropriate legal proceeding promptly initiated and conducted in good faith 
and with due diligence, the validity of any Legal Requirement, the 
applicability of any Legal Requirement to itself or the other such Person

versa), as applicable, or the Property or any alleged violation of any 
Legal Requirement, provided that (i) no Event of Default has occurred and 
remains uncured; (ii) such proceeding shall be permitted under and be 
conducted in accordance with the provisions of any instrument to which 
Borrower or Operating Lessee is subject and shall not constitute a default 
thereunder and such proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with all 
applicable statutes, laws and ordinances; (iii) neither the Property nor 
any part thereof or interest therein will be in danger of being sold, 
forfeited, terminated, cancelled or lost during the pendency of such 
dispute; (iv) Borrower or Operating Lessee shall promptly upon final

be valid or applicable or cure any violation of any Legal Requirement; (v)

Property during the pendency of such dispute; and (vi) Borrower or 
Operating Lessee shall furnish such security as may be required in the 
proceeding, or as may be reasonably requested by Lender, to insure 
compliance with such Legal Requirement, together with all interest and 
penalties payable in connection therewith. Lender may apply any such 
security, as necessary to cause compliance with such Legal Requirement at 
any time when, in the reasonable judgment of Lender, the validity,

danger of being sold, forfeited, terminated, cancelled or lost.

this Section 5.1.2, Borrower shall, or shall cause Operating Lessee to, not 
later than five (5) Business Days after receipt of a written request from 
Lender, deliver to Lender receipts for payment or other evidence 
satisfactory to Lender that the Taxes and Other Charges with respect to the 
Property have been so paid or are not then delinquent no later than ten 
(10) days prior to the date on which the Taxes and/or Other Charges would 
otherwise be delinquent if not paid (provided, however,
 
-91-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
neither Borrower nor Operating Lessee shall be required to furnish such 
receipts for payment of such Taxes and Other Charges during any period that 
Taxes and Other Charges have been paid by Lender pursuant to Section 7.2 
hereof or by Manager or, prior to an R&A Manager Event, R&A Sub-Manager 
pursuant to the Management Agreement or the R&A Management Agreement). 
Except as otherwise provided in the following sentence, neither Borrower 
nor Operating Lessee shall suffer, and Borrower and Operating Lessee shall 
promptly cause to be paid and discharged, any Lien (other than Permitted 
Encumbrances) or charge whatsoever which may be or become a Lien or charge 
against the Property (other than Permitted Encumbrances), and shall 
promptly pay for all utility services provided to the Property. Borrower or 
Operating Lessee, at its own expense, may contest, by appropriate legal 
proceeding, promptly initiated and conducted in good faith and with due 
diligence, the amount or validity or application in whole or in part of any 
Taxes or Other Charges, provided that (i) no Default or Event of Default 
has occurred and remains uncured; (ii) such proceeding shall be permitted 
under and be conducted in accordance with the provisions of any other 
instrument to which Borrower or Operating Lessee is subject and shall not 
constitute a default thereunder and such proceeding shall be conducted in 
accordance with all applicable statutes, laws and ordinances; (iii) neither 
the Property nor any part thereof or interest therein will be in danger of 
being sold, forfeited, terminated, cancelled or lost during the pendency 
thereof; (iv) Borrower or Operating Lessee shall promptly upon final 
determination thereof pay the amount of any such Taxes or Other Charges, 
together with all costs, interest and penalties which may be payable in 
connection therewith; (v) such proceeding shall suspend the collection of 
such contested Taxes or Other Charges from the Property during the pendency 
thereof; (vi) Borrower or Operating Lessee shall furnish such security as 
may be required in the proceeding, or as may be reasonably requested by 
Lender, to insure the payment of any such Taxes or Other Charges, together 
with all interest and penalties thereon; and (vii) Borrower or Operating 
Lessee shall deliver written notice of such contest to Lender. Lender may 
pay over any such cash deposit or part thereof held by Lender to the 
claimant entitled thereto at any time when, in the reasonable judgment of 
Lender, the entitlement of such claimant is established or the Property (or 
part thereof or interest therein) shall be in imminent danger of being 
sold, forfeited, terminated, cancelled or lost or there shall be any danger 
of the Lien of the Mortgage being primed by any related Lien.

5.1.3 Litigation. Borrower shall give prompt written notice to Lender of 
any litigation or governmental proceedings pending or threatened against 
Borrower or Operating Lessee which might have a Material Adverse Effect.

and the rights of Ground Lessor under the Ground Lease, Borrower and 
Operating Lessee shall permit agents, representatives and employees of 
Lender to inspect the Property or any part thereof at reasonable hours upon 
reasonable advance notice.

5.1.5 Notice of Default. Borrower and/or Operating Lessee shall promptly 
advise Lender of any material adverse change in Borrowers, Operating 
Lessees or Guarantors condition, financial or otherwise, or of the 
occurrence of any Default or Event of Default of which Borrower or 
Operating Lessee has knowledge.

5.1.6 Cooperate in Legal Proceedings. Borrower and Operating Lessee shall 
cooperate fully with Lender with respect to any proceedings before any 
court, board or other
 
-92-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Governmental Authority which may in any way materially and adversely affect 
the rights of Lender hereunder or any rights obtained by Lender under any 
of the other Loan Documents and, in connection therewith, permit Lender, at 
its election, to participate in any such proceedings.

5.1.7 Perform Loan Documents. Borrower and Operating Lessee shall in a 
timely manner observe, perform and satisfy all the terms, provisions, 
covenants and conditions of, and shall pay when due all costs, fees and 
expenses to the extent required under the Loan Documents executed and 
delivered by, or applicable to, Borrower or Operating Lessee. Neither 
Borrower nor Operating Lessee shall enter into or otherwise suffer or 
permit any amendment, waiver, supplement, termination or other modification 
of any Loan Document executed and delivered by, or applicable to, Borrower 
or Operating Lessee without the prior written consent of Lender.

5.1.8 Award and Insurance Benefits. Borrower and Operating Lessee shall 
cooperate with Lender in obtaining for Lender the benefits of any Awards or 
Insurance Proceeds lawfully or equitably payable in connection with the 
Property, and Lender shall be reimbursed for any expenses incurred in 
connection therewith (including reasonable attorneys fees and 
disbursements, and the payment by Borrower of the expense of an appraisal 
on behalf of Lender in case of Casualty or Condemnation affecting the 
Property or any part thereof) out of such Insurance Proceeds.

5.1.9 Further Assurances. Borrower and Operating Lessee shall, at 
Borrowers sole cost and expense:

(a) without limiting any other obligation of Borrower or Operating Lessee 
hereunder, upon the written request of Lender, furnish to Lender all 
instruments, documents, boundary surveys, footing or foundation surveys, 
certificates, plans and specifications, appraisals, title and other 
insurance reports and agreements, and each and every other document, 
certificate, agreement and instrument required to be furnished by Borrower 
or Operating Lessee pursuant to the terms of the Loan Documents or which 
are reasonably requested by Lender in connection therewith, provided, that, 
so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the 
foregoing shall not require Borrower or Operating Lessee to obtain updated 
appraisals after the Closing Date, unless specifically required by the 
terms of this Agreement;

(b) execute and deliver to Lender such documents, instruments, 
certificates, assignments and other writings, and do such other acts 
reasonably necessary, to evidence, preserve and/or protect the collateral 
at any time securing or intended to secure the obligations of Borrower and 
Operating Lessee under the Loan Documents, as Lender may reasonably require 
including, without limitation, the execution and delivery of all writings 
necessary to transfer any hospitality, liquor and other licenses required 
for the continued operation of the Property into the name of Lender or its 
designee after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of 
Default to the extent such transfer is permitted by applicable law or, to 
the extent such transfer is not permitted by applicable law, reasonably 
cooperate with Lender in obtaining new hospitality, liquor or other 
licenses required for the continued operation of the Property and 
terminating existing licenses, in each case solely at the direction of 
Lender; and
 
-93-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(c) do and execute all and such further lawful and reasonable acts, 
conveyances and assurances for the better and more effective carrying out 
of the intents and purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, 
as Lender shall reasonably require from time to time.

5.1.10 Principal Place of Business, State of Organization. Neither Borrower 
nor Operating Lessee shall cause or permit any change to be made in its 
name or identity (including its trade name or names) unless Borrower or 
Operating Lessee shall have first notified Lender in writing of such change 
at least thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of such change, and 
shall have first taken all action required by Lender for the purpose of 
perfecting or protecting the lien and security interests of Lender pursuant 
to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Neither Borrower nor 
Operating Lessee shall change its organizational structure or place of 
organization or formation (as set forth in Section 4.1.36 hereof) except as 
permitted pursuant to Section 5.2 hereof, without first obtaining the prior 
written consent of Lender and delivery of a Rating Agency Confirmation. 
Upon Lenders request, Borrower or Operating Lessee shall, at Borrowers 
sole cost and expense, execute and deliver additional financing statements, 
security agreements and other instruments which may be necessary to 
effectively evidence or perfect Lenders security interest in the Property 
as a result of such change of principal place of business or place of 
organization (in the case of a change of place of organization, if approved 
in accordance with the foregoing sentence). Borrowers and Operating 
Lessees principal place of business and chief executive office has been 
for the preceding four months (or, if less, the entire period of the 
existence of Borrower or Operating Lessee) and will continue to be the 
address of Borrower and Operating Lessee set forth at the introductory 
paragraph of this Agreement unless Borrower notifies Lender in writing at 
least thirty (30) days prior to the date of the change and Borrower 
authorizes Lender to file UCC-3 financing statements as necessary or 
desirable to maintain the priority of liens granted hereunder (provided 
that Lender acknowledges that, in connection with the Restructuring, the 
principal place of business of Borrower and Operating Lessee will be 
changed to 1600 Tysons Blvd., Suite 1000, McLean, Virginia, and within a 
reasonable time thereafter, again to 1650 Tysons Blvd., Suite 1300, McLean, 
Virginia, and notwithstanding the foregoing, Borrower shall only be 
required to provide written notice thereof promptly upon each such change, 
provided that, in connection therewith, Borrower and Operating Lessee 
shall, at Borrowers sole cost and expense, execute and deliver additional 
financing statements, security agreements and other instruments which may 
be necessary to effectively evidence or perfect Lenders security interest 
in the Property as a result of such change of principal place of business 
or place of organization). Neither Borrower nor Operating Lessee shall 
change its organizational identification number without the prior written 
consent of Lender. Upon receipt of a written request from Lender, Borrower 
shall execute a certificate in form satisfactory to Lender listing the 
trade names under which either Borrower or Operating Lessee intends to 
operate the Property, and representing and warranting that each of Borrower 
and Operating Lessee does business under no other trade name with respect 
to the Property.

5.1.11 Financial Reporting. (a) Each of Borrower and Operating Lessee will 
keep and maintain or will cause to be kept and maintained on a Fiscal Year 
basis in accordance with GAAP (or such other accounting basis acceptable to 
Lender) as interpreted by the Uniform System of Accounts, proper and 
accurate books, records and accounts reflecting all of its financial 
affairs and all items of income and expense in connection with the 
operation on an individual basis of the Property. Lender shall have the 
right from time to time at all times during
 
-94-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
normal business hours upon reasonable notice (and, in any event, not more 
than two (2) times in any calendar year unless an Event of Default is 
continuing, in which case no such restriction shall apply) to examine such 
books, records and accounts at the office of Borrower, Operating Lessee or 
any other Person maintaining such books, records and accounts and to make 
such copies or extracts thereof as Lender shall desire. After the 
occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, Borrower 
shall pay any reasonable and actual costs and expenses incurred by Lender 
to examine Borrowers or Operating Lessees accounting records with respect 
to the Property, as Lender shall reasonably determine to be necessary or 
appropriate in the protection of Lenders interest.

(b) Borrower will furnish to Lender annually, within seventy-five (75) days 
following the end of each Fiscal Year, a copy of Borrowers and Operating 
Lessees unaudited financial statements covering the Property for such 
Fiscal Year and containing statements of profit and loss for Borrower, 
Operating Lessee and the Property and a balance sheet for Borrower and 
Operating Lessee. Such statements shall set forth the financial condition 
and the results of operations for the Property for such Fiscal Year, and 
shall include, but not be limited to, amounts representing annual Net 
Operating Income, Gross Income from Operations and Operating Expenses (not 
including any contributions to the Replacement Reserve Account). Borrowers 
and Operating Lessees annual financial statements shall be accompanied by 
(i) an Officers Certificate stating that each such annual financial 
statement presents fairly the financial condition and the results of 
operations of Borrower, Operating Lessee and the Property being reported 
upon as of such date and has been prepared in accordance with GAAP (or such 
other accounting basis acceptable to Lender), as interpreted by the Uniform 
System of Accounts and (ii) occupancy statistics including revenue per 
available room and average daily rates for the Property. Together with 
Borrowers and Operating Lessees annual financial statements, Borrower 
shall furnish to Lender an Officers Certificate certifying as of the date 
thereof whether there exists, to Borrowers knowledge, an event or 
circumstance which constitutes a Default or Event of Default under the Loan 
Documents executed and delivered by, or applicable to, Borrower or 
Operating Lessee, and if such Default or Event of Default exists, the 
nature thereof, the period of time it has existed and the action then being 
taken to remedy the same.

(c) Within one hundred twenty (120) days following the end of each Fiscal 
Year, Borrower shall provide a complete copy of Guarantors (or its 
publicly traded parent) annual financial statements audited by a Big Four 
accounting firm or other independent certified public accountant acceptable 
to Lender in accordance with GAAP as interpreted by the Uniform System of 
Accounts (or such other accounting basis acceptable to Lender). The 
financial information for the Property, Borrower and Operating Lessee shall 
be included as part of Guarantors (or its publicly traded parents) annual 
audited financial statements.

(d) Borrower will furnish, or cause to be furnished, to Lender on or before 
forty (40) days after the end of (i) prior to a Securitization, each 
calendar month and (ii) after a Securitization, each calendar quarter, each 
the following items, accompanied by an Officers Certificate stating that 
(A) such items are true, correct, accurate, and complete and fairly present 
the financial condition and results of the operations of Borrower, 
Operating Lessee and the Property (subject to normal year-end adjustments) 
as of the relevant date, as applicable, and (B) the representations and 
warranties of Borrower and Operating Lessee set forth in subsection 
(xxiii) of the definition of Special Purpose Entity are true and correct 
as of the date
 
-95-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
of such certificate: (i) an occupancy report for the subject month, 
including an average daily rate and revenue per available room; (ii) 
monthly or quarterly (as applicable) and year to date operating statements 
prepared for each calendar month or quarter (as applicable), noting EBITDA, 
Gross Income from Operations, and Operating Expenses (not including any 
contributions to the Replacement Reserve Account), and other information 
necessary and sufficient to fairly represent the financial position and 
results of operation of the Property during such calendar month or quarter 
(as applicable), and containing a comparison of budgeted income and 
expenses and the actual income and expenses, all in form satisfactory to 
Lender, (iii) during a Cash Trap Period, upon the written request of 
Lender, a detailed explanation of any variances of ten percent (10%) or 
more between budgeted and actual amounts for such periods, (iv) the most 
current Smith Travel Research Reports then available to Borrower or 
Operating Lessee reflecting market penetration and relevant hotel 
properties competing with the Property and (v) a certified rent roll for 
the Retail Component in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B.

(e) Lender hereby acknowledges receipt of the forecasted Annual Budget for 
the remainder of the Fiscal Year-ending on December 31, 2016. Borrower or 
Operating Lessee shall submit to Lender an Annual Budget upon the earlier 
to occur of (i) the date which is five (5) Business Days after receipt by 
Borrower or Operating Lessee, as applicable, of such Annual Budget from 
Manager and (ii) December 31 of then-current calendar year (which, subject 
to the immediately succeeding sentence shall be for informational purposes 
only). If a Cash Trap Period is continuing, the Annual Budget shall be 
subject to Lenders reasonable written approval, which approval shall not 
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed (each such Annual Budget, 
an Approved Annual Budget); provided, however, that Lender shall not 
withhold its consent with respect to (i) expenditures necessary to comply 
with life, health or safety matters and (ii) Employment Costs (as such term 
is defined in the Management Agreement). So long as no Cash Trap Period is 
continuing, any Annual Budget and any amendments or modifications thereto 
shall be deemed an Approved Annual Budget and Lender shall have no approval 
right with respect thereto. In the event that Borrower is required to 
submit an Annual Budget for approval pursuant to this Section 5.1.11(e), 
each such request for approval of an Annual Budget shall contain the 
following legend in prominently displayed in bold, all caps and fourteen 
(14) point or larger font in the transmittal letter requesting approval: 
THIS IS A REQUEST FOR APPROVAL OF AN ANNUAL BUDGET. LENDERS RESPONSE IS 
REQUESTED WITHIN TEN (10) DAYS. In the event that Lender fails to grant or 
withhold its approval to such Annual Budget within such ten (10) day 
period, Borrower shall deliver to Lender a second request for approval 
containing the following legend in prominently displayed in bold, all caps 
and fourteen (14) point or larger font in the transmittal letter requesting 
approval: THIS IS A SECOND REQUEST FOR APPROVAL OF AN ANNUAL BUDGET. 
LENDERS RESPONSE IS REQUESTED WITHIN TEN (10) DAYS. LENDERS FAILURE TO 
RESPOND WITHIN SUCH TIME PERIOD SHALL RESULT IN LENDERS APPROVAL BEING 
DEEMED TO HAVE BEEN GRANTED. In the event that Lender fails to grant or 
withhold its approval to such Annual Budget within such ten (10) day 
period, then Lenders approval shall be deemed to have been granted. In the 
event that Lender timely disapproves a proposed Annual Budget in accordance 
with the foregoing, Borrower or Operating Lessee shall promptly revise such 
Annual Budget and resubmit the same to Lender (and each such resubmittal 
shall be subject to the provisions of this Section 5.1.11(e) as if the 
applicable proposed Annual Budget were being submitted to Lender for its 
initial review of the same, provided that the aforesaid ten (10) day 
periods shall each be five (5) days in connection with
 
-96-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
any such resubmittal). Borrower or Operating Lessee shall promptly revise 
each proposed Annual Budget and resubmit the same to Lender in accordance 
with the foregoing until Lender approves the proposed Annual Budget. Until 
such time that Lender approves a proposed Annual Budget, the most recently 
Approved Annual Budget shall apply; provided that, each line item of such 
Approved Annual Budget shall be increased by the amount of the increase, if 
any, in the Consumer Price Index for the immediately preceding calendar 
year (other than the line items in respect of Taxes, Insurance Premiums, 
union wages, utilities expenses and Other Charges, which line items shall 
be adjusted to reflect actual increases in such expenses).

(f) In the event that, during any Cash Trap Period, Borrower or Operating 
Lessee must incur a capital expense not set forth in the Approved Annual 
Budget (each an Extraordinary Expense), then Borrower shall promptly 
deliver to Lender a reasonably detailed explanation of such proposed 
Extraordinary Expense for Lenders approval, which approval shall not be 
unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed; provided, that Lenders 
consent shall not be required in connection with: capital expenditures (i) 
necessary to comply with life, health or safety matters and Legal 
Requirements and (ii) for which Borrower and/or Operating Lessee is 
permitted to use Excess Cash Flow Reserve Funds, to the extent that there 
are sufficient funds available. For the avoidance of doubt, from and after 
the date of the Restructuring, nothing in this clause (f) shall be deemed 
to limit Managers, or prior to any R&A Manager Event, R&A Sub-Managers 
rights set forth elsewhere with respect to the Operating Accounts and the 
FF&E Account.

(g) During the continuance of a Cash Trap Period, neither Borrower nor 
Operating Lessee (as applicable) shall approve (to the extent either 
Borrower or Operating Lessee is permitted to approve or reject such 
operating budget pursuant to the terms of the Management Agreement or any 
Replacement R&A Management Agreement affecting any portion of the Property 
from time to time subject to the Mortgage) any operating budget pursuant to 
the Management Agreement or any Replacement R&A Management Agreement 
affecting any portion of the Property from time to time subject to the 
Mortgage without the prior written consent of Lender (such consent not to 
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Lender shall cooperate 
with Borrower and/or Operating Lessee (as applicable) to follow the 
procedures for budget approval set forth in the Management Agreement or any 
such Replacement R&A Management Agreement to the extent Borrower or 
Operating Lessee notifies Lender thereof.

(h) Any reports, statements or other information required to be delivered 
under this Agreement may be delivered via email or on a diskette and/or, if 
requested by Lender and within the capabilities of Borrowers data systems 
without change or modification thereto, with report files in electronic 
form of Microsoft Word or Microsoft Excel (which files may be prepared 
using a spreadsheet program and saved as word processing files). Borrower 
agrees that Lender may disclose information regarding the Property and 
Borrower that is provided to Lender pursuant to this Section 5.1.11(h) in 
connection with the Securitization to such parties requesting such 
information in connection with such Securitization.

5.1.12 Business and Operations. Each of Borrower and Operating Lessee shall 
continue to engage in the businesses presently conducted by it (or, with 
respect to Operating Lessee, contemplated to be conducted by it pursuant to 
the Operating Lease) as and to the extent

------------------------------------------------------------------------
the same are necessary for the ownership or leasing (as applicable), 
maintenance, management, leasing and operation of the Property. Each of 
Borrower and Operating Lessee shall qualify to do business and will remain 
in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its formation as and 
to the extent the same are required for the ownership, maintenance, 
management and operation of the Property. Each of Borrower and Operating 
Lessee shall at all times during the term of the Loan, continue to own or

warrant and defend (a) the title to the Property and every part thereof, 
subject only to Liens permitted hereunder (including Permitted 
Encumbrances) and (b) the validity and priority of the Lien of the Mortgage 
on the Property, subject only to Liens permitted hereunder (including 
Permitted Encumbrances), in each case against the claims of all Persons 
whomsoever. Borrower shall reimburse Lender for any losses, costs, damages 
or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and court costs) incurred

hereunder, is claimed by another Person.

foreclosed in whole or in part or that the Mortgage is put into the hands 
of an attorney for collection, suit, action or foreclosure, (b) of the

to the Mortgage in which proceeding Lender is made a party, or (c) of the 
bankruptcy, insolvency, rehabilitation or other similar proceeding in 
respect of Borrower or any of its constituent Persons or an assignment by

creditors, Borrower and its successors or assigns, shall be chargeable with 
and agrees to pay all out-of-pocket costs of collection and defense, 
including reasonable third party attorneys fees and expenses, incurred by 
Lender or Borrower in connection therewith, but excluding regular servicing 
fees and in connection with any appellate proceeding or post judgment 
action involved therein, together with all required service or use taxes.

5.1.15 Estoppel Statement. (a) After request by Lender, Borrower shall 
within ten (10) Business Days furnish Lender with a statement, duly 
acknowledged and certified, setting forth (i) the original principal amount 
of each Note, (ii) the unpaid principal amount of each Note, (iii) the 
Interest Rate of each Note, (iv) the date installments of interest and/or

particulars of such modification; provided, however, that so long as no 
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Borrower shall not be

each commercial Tenant party to a Material Lease at the Property, (ii) an

(iii) an estoppel certificate from each counterparty under any Material 
Property Agreement, in each case, in form and substance reasonably 
satisfactory to Lender;
 
-98-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
provided, however, that so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is 
continuing, Borrower shall not be required to seek such statement more than 
one (1) time in any calendar year.

5.1.16 Loan Proceeds. Borrower shall use the proceeds of the Loan received 
by it on the Closing Date only for the purposes set forth in Section 2.1.4 
hereof.

5.1.17 Intentionally Omitted.

deliver, upon written request from Lender in connection with any 
Securitization, (a) one (1) or more Officers Certificates certifying as to 
the accuracy of all representations in all material respects made by

suffer, permit or initiate the joint assessment of the Property (a) with 
any other real property constituting a tax lot separate from the Property,

which may be deemed to constitute personal property, or any other procedure 
whereby the lien of any taxes which may be levied against such personal 
property shall be assessed or levied or charged to such real property 
portion of the Property.

5.1.20 Intentionally Omitted.

5.1.21 Leasing Matters. (a) Subject to subsection (b) below, Borrower or 
Operating Lessee may enter into any Lease or other rental arrangement, 
exercise all extensions and renewals and enter into any modification, 
amendments and supplements to any Leases without the prior approval of 
Lender, provided that, any new Lease entered into after the date hereof

(b) Any (i) Material Leases or (ii) Leases to an Affiliate of Borrower or 
Operating Lessee written after the Closing Date (other than any Lease with

additional incremental revenue to the applicable Property in excess of its 
stated rent. Borrower or Operating Lessee, as applicable, (i) shall observe 
and perform the obligations imposed upon the lessor under each Lease to 
which it is a party in a commercially reasonable manner; (ii) shall enforce 
the terms, covenants and conditions contained in the Leases upon the part 
of the lessee under each such Lease to be observed or performed in a 
commercially reasonable manner and in a manner not to impair the value of 
the Property involved except that no termination by Borrower or Operating 
Lessee or acceptance of surrender by a Tenant of any Material Lease 
(regardless of when any such Material Lease was entered into) shall be 
permitted unless by reason of (A) a Tenant default and then only in a 
commercially reasonable manner to preserve and protect the Property; or (B) 
the exercise by a Tenant of any termination right expressly provided in any 
existing Material Lease or any Material Lease hereafter entered into in 
compliance with the conditions set forth in this Section 5.1.21; (iii) 
shall not collect any of the rents more than one (1) month in advance 
(other than security deposits, payments of the first months rent upon

execute any other assignment of lessors interest in the Leases or the 
Rents (except as contemplated by the Loan Documents); (v) shall not alter, 
modify or change the terms of the Leases in a manner inconsistent with the 
provisions of the Loan Documents; (vi) shall not alter, modify or change 
the terms of any Material Lease (regardless of when any such Material Lease 
was entered into) without the prior written consent of Lender, which 
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, which 
consent shall be subject to the deemed approval provisions set forth in 
this Section; and (vii) shall execute and deliver at the request of Lender 
all such further assurances, confirmations and assignments in connection 
with the Leases
 
-100-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
as Lender shall from time to time reasonably require. Notwithstanding 
anything to the contrary contained herein, neither Borrower nor Operating 
Lessee shall enter into a lease of all or substantially all of the Property 
(except for the execution of the Operating Lease in accordance with the 
terms of this Agreement) without Lenders prior written consent. Each such 
request for approval of a Lease shall contain the following legend in 
prominently displayed in bold, all caps and fourteen (14) point or larger 
font in the transmittal letter requesting approval: THIS IS A REQUEST FOR 
APPROVAL OF A LEASE. LENDERS RESPONSE IS REQUESTED WITHIN TEN (10) DAYS. 
In the event that Lender fails to grant or withhold its approval to such 
Lease within such ten (10) day period, Borrower shall deliver to Lender a 
second request for approval containing the following legend in prominently 
displayed in bold, all caps and fourteen (14) point or larger font in the 
transmittal letter requesting approval: THIS IS A SECOND REQUEST FOR 
APPROVAL OF A LEASE. LENDERS RESPONSE IS REQUESTED WITHIN FIVE (5) DAYS. 
LENDERS FAILURE TO RESPOND WITHIN SUCH TIME PERIOD SHALL RESULT IN 
LENDERS APPROVAL BEING DEEMED TO HAVE BEEN GRANTED. In the event that 
Lender fails to grant or withhold its approval to such Lease within such 
five (5) day period, then Lenders approval shall be deemed to have been 
granted. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Lender consent shall not be 
required in connection with (i) any Lease (or amendment, modification or 
termination thereof) that is not a Material Lease, (ii) renewals, 
expansions or extensions of any Lease (including a Material Lease) by a 
tenant that is a party to such lease as of the Closing Date so long as the 
rental terms are on market terms (or on terms contemplated in the Lease in 
place on the Closing Date or any new Lease entered into in accordance with 
this Agreement), (iii) any de minimis modifications of any Material Lease, 
(iv) a commercially reasonable termination of any Material Lease arising 
from a default by the tenant thereunder or (v) an assignment of any Lease 
by the tenant thereunder for which Borrower has a consent right which is 
not to be unreasonably withheld, pursuant to the terms of such Lease.

5.1.22 Alterations. Borrower or Operating Lessee, as applicable, shall 
obtain Lenders prior written consent to any alterations to any 
Improvements, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed 
except with respect to alterations that would be reasonably likely to have 
a Material Adverse Effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Lenders consent 
shall not be required in connection with any alterations to the Property 
that (a) intentionally omitted, (b) upon completion of same, will not have 
a Material Adverse Effect and provided that the cost thereof, when 
aggregated with the cost of all other alterations undertaken at the 
Property in the applicable calendar year is less than $35,000,000 (the 
Threshold Consent Amount), provided, that any amounts expended for 
alterations pursuant to clauses (a), (c)(ii), (c)(iii), and (d) through 
(g) of this Section 5.1.22 shall not be included toward the calculation of 
the aggregate annual costs of such alterations for purposes of the 
Threshold Consent Amount, (c) are (i) specifically provided for in the 
Approved Annual Budget, (ii) a permitted variance for health, life and 
safety items under the Management Agreement or (iii) otherwise consented to 
by Lender and to be funded from the Reserve Funds or either the Borrower 
Remainder Account or the Operating Lessee Remainder Account (as each are 
defined in the applicable Cash Management Agreement) in accordance with 
this Agreement, (d) constitute a tenant improvement required to be made 
under a Lease existing on the Closing Date or a Lease entered into after 
the Closing

connection with the Restoration of the Property undertaken in accordance 
with the terms and provisions of this Agreement, (f) are for Replacements

to be performed pursuant to the terms of the Management Agreement, provided 
that Borrower or Operating Lessee, as applicable, does not otherwise have a 
right to consent thereto pursuant to the Management Agreement. If the total 
unpaid amounts due and payable with respect to alterations to the 
Improvements being conducted at the Property (excluding alterations of the 
kind described in clauses (a), (c)(ii), (c)(iii), and (d) through (g) of 
the preceding sentence) shall at any time exceed four percent (4%) of the 
original principal balance of the Loan (the Threshold Amount), Borrower 
shall promptly deliver to Lender as security for the payment of such 
amounts and as additional security for Borrowers obligations under the 
Loan Documents any of the following in any amount sufficient to cover the 
excess of the aggregate cost of such alterations over the Threshold Amount 
(the Alterations Deposit): (A) cash, (B) U.S. Obligations, (C) other 
securities having a rating reasonably acceptable to Lender and, after a 
Securitization, that, at Lenders option, the applicable Approved Rating 
Agencies have provided a Rating Agency Confirmation with respect to such 
securities or (D) a Letter of Credit. The Alterations Deposit shall be 
disbursed from time to time by Lender to Borrower or Operating Lessee for 
completion of the alterations at the Property upon the satisfaction of the 
following conditions: (1) Borrower shall submit a request for payment to 
Lender at least five (5) Business Days prior to the date on which Borrower 
requests that such payment be made, which request for payment shall specify 
the alterations for which payment is requested, (2) on the date such 
request is received by Lender and on the date such payment is to be made, 
no Event of Default shall be continuing, and (3) such request shall be 
accompanied by an Officers Certificate (x) stating that the applicable 
portion of the alterations at the Property to be funded by the requested 
disbursement have been completed in good and workmanlike manner and in 
accordance with all applicable Legal Requirements, such Officers 
Certificate to be accompanied by copies of paid invoices or copies of 
invoices to be paid, and with respect to any invoices in excess of $25,000,

Authority required in connection with the applicable portion of the 
alterations, (y) identifying each contractor that supplied materials or 
labor in connection with the applicable portion of the alterations to be 
funded by the requested disbursement and (z) stating that, upon such 
disbursement, each such contractor has been paid or will have been paid in 
full for all amounts then due and owing to such contractor. Each 
Alterations Deposit shall be held by Lender in an interest-bearing account 
and, until disbursed in accordance with the provisions of this Section 
5.1.22, shall constitute additional security for the Debt and other 
obligations under the Loan Documents. Upon the completion of the 
alterations in respect of which any Alteration Deposit is being held, 
Lender shall promptly return to Borrower any remaining portion of the 
Alterations Deposit upon the request of Borrower, provided that (1) on the 
date such request is received by Lender and on the date such disbursement 
is to be made, no Event of Default shall be continuing, and (2) such 
request shall be accompanied by an Officers Certificate stating that the 
alterations have been fully completed in good and workmanlike manner and in 
accordance with all applicable Legal Requirements, such Officers 
Certificate to be accompanied by copies of paid invoices or copies of 
invoices to be paid, as applicable, and, with respect to any invoices in 
excess of $25,000, copies of any licenses, permits

or other approvals by any Governmental Authority required in connection 
with alterations (to the extent not received by Lender in connection with 
prior disbursement requests) and stating that each contractor providing 
services in connection with the alterations has been paid in full or will 
have been paid in full upon such disbursement.

5.1.23 Operation of Property. (a) Each of Borrower and Operating Lessee 
shall (and shall, if necessary, exercise its rights under the Management 
Agreement or under the R&A Management Agreement or any Replacement R&A 
Management Agreement to cause the Manager and any R&A Manager to) cause the 
Property to be operated, in all material respects, in accordance with the 
Management Agreement or applicable Replacement Management Agreement and in 
accordance with all applicable Legal Requirements. In the event that the 
Management Agreement, the R&A Management Agreement or any Replacement R&A 
Management Agreement expires or is terminated (without limiting any 
obligation of Borrower or Operating Lessee to obtain Lenders consent to 
any termination or modification thereof in accordance with the terms and 
provisions of this Agreement), Borrower or Operating Lessee shall promptly 
enter into a Replacement Management Agreement with Manager or another 
Qualified Manager or a Replacement R&A Management Agreement with R&A 
Manager or another Qualified Manager, as applicable.

(b) Each of Borrower and Operating Lessee, as applicable, shall: (i) 
promptly perform and/or observe, in all material respects, all of the 
covenants and agreements required to be performed and observed by it under 
the Management Agreement, the R&A Management Agreement and any Replacement 
R&A Management Agreement and do all things necessary to preserve and to 
keep unimpaired its material rights thereunder; (ii) promptly after they 
become aware, notify Lender of any material default under the Management 
Agreement, R&A Management Agreement or any Replacement R&A Management 
Agreement; (iii) promptly deliver to Lender a copy of each financial 
statement, business plan, capital expenditures plan, any material written 
notice, material written report and material written estimate received by 
it under any such Management Agreement; and (iv) enforce the performance 
and observance of all of the covenants and agreements required to be 
performed and/or observed by Manager or R&A Manager under any such 
Management Agreement in a commercially reasonable manner.

(c) Any Replacement Management Agreement shall be with a Qualified Manager 
and shall include rights to utilize such Qualified Managers (or its 
Affiliates) intellectual property for purposes of branding the Property 
(other than any portion of the Borrower Retained Property that is not 
managed pursuant to the Management Agreement, as to which the concept of 
branding is inapplicable) unless Borrower or Operating Lessee enters into a 
franchise agreement reasonably acceptable to Lender on third-party market 
rate terms with a Qualified Manager. Neither Borrower nor Operating Lessee 
shall permit Manager or any Affiliate of HWHI to rebrand the Property 
(other than any portion of the Borrower Retained Property that is not 
managed pursuant to the Management Agreement, as to which the concept of 
branding is inapplicable) to a lower category based on the annual chain 
scale published by Smith Travel Reports without the consent of Lender, 
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. 
At no time shall the Property (other than the Borrower Retained Property, 
as to which the concept of branding is inapplicable) be operated as an 
unbranded hotel.
 
-103-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(d) Borrower shall have the right, at any time and without the consent of 
Lender, to sever the management of all or any portion of the Borrower 
Retained Property from the Management Agreement (an R&A Management 
Severance), provided that (i) in connection therewith, the Management 
Agreement shall be amended as necessary to reflect the R&A Management 
Severance (unless no such amendment is required to effect such R&A 
Management Severance), (ii) the R&A Management Agreement shall be amended 
or terminated as necessary to reflect the R&A Management Severance (unless 
no such amendment or termination is required to effect such R&A Management 
Severance), and (iii) Borrower shall enter into Replacement R&A Management 
Agreement with a Qualified R&A Manager and such Replacement R&A Management 
Agreement shall be subject to the review and approval of the Lender (such 
approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), provided 
that the management fees under such Replacement R&A Management Agreement 
shall not exceed the then prevailing market rates. Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, Borrower agrees that it shall not be unreasonable for Lender to 
condition its consent to a Replacement R&A Management Agreement on the 
Qualified R&A Manager that is party thereto and Borrower executing and 
delivering to Lender a collateral assignment of the Replacement R&A 
Management Agreement and subordination of management fees payable 
thereunder, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Lender.

(e) R&A Manager shall, as long as the Loan is outstanding and it is the 
manager under the R&A Management Agreement, irrevocably delegate all rights 
and obligations under the R&A Management Agreement to the R&A Sub Manager 
pursuant to the Management Agreement.

5.1.24 Tenant Estoppels. Borrower shall use commercially reasonable efforts 
to obtain and deliver to Lender, as promptly as reasonably practicable 
following the Closing Date, tenant estoppel certificates in the form 
provided by Lender or, if applicable, the form required pursuant the terms 
of the applicable Tenants Lease (with such modifications thereto as shall 
be reasonably acceptable to Lender) from each of the Tenants listed on 
Schedule 5.1.24 attached hereto.

5.1.25 Embargoed Person. Borrower, Operating Lessee and Principal have 
performed and shall perform reasonable due diligence to insure that at all 
times throughout the term of the Loan, including after giving effect to any 
Transfers permitted pursuant to the Loan Documents, (a) none of the funds 
or other assets of Borrower, Operating Lessee, Principal or Guarantor 
constitute property of, or are beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, 
by any Embargoed Person; (b) no Embargoed Person has any interest of any 
nature whatsoever in Borrower, Operating Lessee, Principal or Guarantor, 
with the result that the investment in Borrower, Operating Lessee, 
Principal or Guarantor, as applicable (whether directly or indirectly), is 
prohibited by law or the Loan is in violation of law; and (c) none of the 
funds of Borrower, Operating Lessee, Principal or Guarantor, have been 
derived from, or are the proceeds of, any unlawful activity, including 
money laundering, terrorism or terrorism activities, with the result that 
the investment in Borrower, Operating Lessee, Principal or Guarantor, as 
applicable (whether directly or indirectly), is prohibited by law or the 
Loan is in violation of law, or may cause the Property to be subject to 
forfeiture or seizure.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.1.26 Ground Lease. (a) Borrower shall, at its sole cost and expense, 
promptly and timely perform and observe all the material terms, covenants 
and conditions required to be performed and observed by Borrower, as lessee 
under the Ground Lease (including, but not limited to, the payment of all 
rent, additional rent, percentage rent and other charges required to be 
paid under the Ground Lease).

(b) If Borrower shall be in default under the Ground Lease, then, subject 
to the terms of the Ground Lease, Borrower shall grant Lender the right 
(but not the obligation), subject to the terms of the Ground Lease, to 
cause the default or defaults under the Ground Lease to be remedied and 
otherwise exercise any and all rights of Borrower under the Ground Lease, 
as may be necessary to prevent or cure any default, provided such actions 
are necessary to protect Lenders interest in the Property under the Loan 
Documents and Lender shall, subject to the rights of Tenants, Permitted 
Encumbrances and hotel guests and patrons, have the right to enter all or 
any portion of the Ground Lease Property at such times and in such manner 
as Lender deems necessary, to prevent or to cure any such default, provided 
that in each case, such actions are necessary to protect Lenders interest 
in the Property under the Loan Documents.

(c) The actions or payments of Lender to cure any default by Borrower under 
the Ground Lease shall not remove or waive, as between Borrower and Lender, 
the default that occurred under this Agreement by virtue of the default by 
Borrower under the Ground Lease unless and until Borrower shall have 
reimbursed Lender for all sums referenced in the immediately succeeding 
sentence and the applicable default shall have been cured. All sums 
expended by Lender to cure any such default shall be paid by Borrower to 
Lender, upon demand, with interest on such sum at the rate set forth in 
this Agreement from the date such sum is expended to and including the date 
the reimbursement payment is made to Lender. All such indebtedness shall be 
deemed to be secured by the Mortgage.

(d) Borrower shall notify Lender promptly in writing of the occurrence of 
any material default by Ground Lessor under the Ground Lease or following 
the receipt by Borrower of any written notice from Ground Lessor under the 
Ground Lease noting or claiming the occurrence of any default by Borrower 
under the Ground Lease or the occurrence of any event that, with the 
passage of time or service of notice, or both, would constitute a default 
by Borrower under the Ground Lease. Borrower shall promptly deliver to 
Lender a copy of any such written notice of default.

(e) Upon the written request of Lender, Borrower shall use commercially 
reasonable efforts to obtain from Ground Lessor under the Ground Lease and 
furnish to Lender the estoppel certificate of Ground Lessor stating the 
date through which rent has been paid and whether or not there are any 
defaults thereunder and specifying the nature of such claimed defaults, if 
any, but in no event (so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is 
continuing) more than one (1) time in any Fiscal Year.

(f) Borrower shall promptly execute, acknowledge and deliver to Lender such 
instruments as may reasonably be required to permit Lender to cure any 
default under the Ground Lease or permit Lender to take such other action 
required to enable Lender to cure or remedy the matter in default and 
preserve the security interest of Lender under the Loan Documents with 
respect to the Ground Lease Property. Borrower irrevocably appoints Lender 
as
 
-105-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
its true and lawful attorney-in-fact to do, in its name or otherwise, after 
the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default, any and 
all acts and to execute any and all documents that are necessary to 
preserve any rights of Borrower under or with respect to the Ground Lease, 
including, without limitation, the right to effectuate any extension or 
renewal of the Ground Lease, or to preserve any rights of Borrower 
whatsoever in respect of any part of the Ground Lease (and the above powers 
granted to Lender are coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable).

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement 
with respect to the Ground Lease:

(i) The lien of the Mortgage attaches to all of Borrowers rights and 
remedies at any time arising under or pursuant to Subsection 365(h) of the 
Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. Sections 101 et seq., including, without 
limitation, all of Borrowers rights, as debtor, to remain in possession of 
the Ground Lease Property.

(ii) Borrower shall not, without Lenders written consent, elect to treat 
the Ground Lease as terminated under Subsection 365(h)(l) of the Bankruptcy 
Code. Any such election made without Lenders prior written consent shall 
be void.

(iii) As security for the Debt, Borrower unconditionally assigns, transfers 
and sets over to Lender all of Borrowers claims and rights to the payment 
of damages arising from any rejection by the lessor under the Ground Lease 
under the Bankruptcy Code. Lender and Borrower shall proceed jointly or in 
the name of Borrower in respect of any claim, suit, action or proceeding 
relating to the rejection of the Ground Lease, including, without 
limitation, the right to file and prosecute any proofs of claim, 
complaints, motions, applications, notices and other documents in any case 
in respect of lessor under the Bankruptcy Code. This assignment constitutes 
a present, irrevocable and unconditional assignment of the foregoing 
claims, rights and remedies, and shall continue in effect until all of the 
Debt shall have been satisfied and discharged in full. Any amounts received 
by Lender or Borrower as damages arising out of the rejection of the Ground 
Lease as aforesaid shall be applied to all costs and expenses of Lender 
(including, without limitation, attorneys fees and costs) incurred in 
connection with the exercise of any of its rights or remedies in accordance 
with the applicable provisions of this Agreement.

(iv) If, pursuant to Subsection 365(h) of the Bankruptcy Code, Borrower 
seeks to offset, against the rent reserved in the Ground Lease, the amount 
of any damages caused by the nonperformance by the lessor of any of its 
obligations thereunder after the rejection by lessor of the Ground Lease 
under the Bankruptcy Code, then Borrower shall not effect any offset of 
such amounts unless it shall have provided written notice to Lender of its 
intent to do so and Lender shall have consented thereto (provided Lender 
shall be deemed to have consented thereto if it shall fail to object to the 
same in written notice to Borrower within ten (10) Business Days after 
receipt of the aforementioned notice, in which case Borrower may proceed to 
offset the amounts set forth in Borrowers notice.
 
-106-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(v) If any action, proceeding, motion or notice shall be commenced or filed 
in respect of any lessor of all or any part of the Ground Lease Property in 
connection with any case under the Bankruptcy Code, Lender and Borrower 
shall cooperatively conduct and control any such litigation with counsel 
agreed upon between Borrower and Lender in connection with such litigation. 
Borrower shall, upon demand, pay to Lender all reasonable actual out of 
pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and costs) 
actually paid or actually incurred by Lender in connection with the 
cooperative prosecution or conduct of any such proceedings. All such costs 
and expenses shall be secured by the lien of the Mortgage.

(vi) Borrower shall notify Lender of any filing by or against the lessor 
under the Ground Lease of a petition under the Bankruptcy Code of which it 
has knowledge, setting forth any information available to Borrower as to 
the date of such filing, the court in which such petition was filed, and 
the relief sought in such filing. Borrower shall deliver to Lender any and 
all notices, summonses, pleadings, applications and other documents 
received by Borrower in connection with any such petition and any 
proceedings relating to such petition.

(h) if Lender, its nominee, designee, successor, or assignee acquires title 
and/or rights of Borrower under the Ground Lease by reason of foreclosure 
of the Mortgage, deed in lieu of foreclosure or otherwise, such party shall 
(x) succeed to all of the rights of and benefits accruing to Borrower under 
the Ground Lease, and (y) be entitled to exercise all of the rights and 
benefits accruing to Borrower under the Ground Lease. At such time as 
Lender shall request, Borrower agrees to execute and deliver and use 
commercially reasonable efforts to cause any third party to execute and 
deliver to Lender such documents as Lender and its counsel may reasonably 
require in order to insure that the provisions of this section will be 
validly and legally enforceable and effective against Borrower and all 
parties claiming by, through, under or against Borrower.

(i) For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this Section 5.1.26 
shall cease to be in full force and effect from and after the release of 
the Taran Outparcel from the Lien of the Mortgage pursuant to, and in 
accordance with, the provisions of Section 2.5.2.

5.1.27 Payment of Obligations. Borrower will pay its obligations, including 
tax liabilities, that, if not paid, could result in a Material Adverse 
Effect before the same shall become delinquent or in default, except where 
(a) the validity or amount thereof is being contested in good faith by 
appropriate proceedings, (b) Borrower has set aside on its books adequate 
reserves with respect thereto in accordance with GAAP, as interpreted by 
the Uniform System of Accounts or (c) the failure to make payment pending 
such contest could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material 
Adverse Effect, and provided that the foregoing shall not require any 
partners, members, shareholders or other owners of Borrower to make 
additional capital contributions to Borrower.

any business other than acquiring, developing, owning, holding, selling,

other than acting as a general partner of the limited partnership that owns 
the Property or as member of the limited liability company that owns the

(b) Neither Borrower nor Operating Lessee shall have any Indebtedness other 
than (I) in the case of Borrower, the Loan, (II) Permitted Debt, (III) as 
may be required pursuant to the Ground Lease and (IV) such other 
liabilities that it is expressly permitted to incur pursuant to this 
Agreement or as otherwise imposed by law, no Principal shall have any 
Indebtedness.

(c) except (i) pursuant to the Operating Lease or the Owner Agreement and

is made or a fact stated in any Insolvency Opinion will comply with all of 
the assumptions made and facts stated with respect to it in any such 
Insolvency Opinion. Each of Borrower, Operating Lessee and Principal 
covenants that, in connection with any Additional Insolvency Opinion

generality of the foregoing, Borrower, for and on behalf of itself and its 
direct and indirect successors and assigns as owner(s) of condominium units 
in the Condominium or any of them, (i) irrevocably waives, to the extent 
permitted by law, any applicable law which grants to the trustees of the

of a casualty or a condemnation which are inconsistent with the provisions 
of Article VI hereof and (ii) expressly agrees to the application of the 
insurance proceeds and condemnation awards in accordance with Article VI

shall cease to be in full force and effect as to Condominium that

5.1.31 O&M Program. Borrower hereby represents and warrants that the 
operations and maintenance plan(s) described on Schedule 5.1.31 hereto (as 
the same may be amended, restated or replaced from time to time, each an 
O&M Program) are true and complete descriptions of the O&M Programs in 
place with respect to the Property, and (b) Borrower has as of the date

term of the Loan, Borrower and Operating Lessee shall comply in all 
material respects with the terms and conditions of each O&M Program.

shall at all times comply in all material respects with all Material

Operating Lease is not a lease under applicable real property laws or under 
laws governing bankruptcy, insolvency and creditors rights generally, and 
that the interest of Operating Lessee thereunder in the Property is other 
than that of tenant under an operating lease, Borrower hereby covenants and 
agrees that it shall cause Operating Lessees interest in the Property, 
however characterized, to continue to be subject and subordinate to the

covenants and agrees with Lender that it will not do, or permit to be done, 
directly or indirectly, any of the following:

consent to the reduction of the term of the Management Agreement or any 
Replacement R&A Management Agreement (except in connection with a 
replacement permitted under clause (i) that continues the term); (iii)

Lenders sole discretion.
 
-111-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(c) Borrower and Operating Lessee shall use commercially reasonable efforts 
to cause any Manager Account to be an Eligible Account.

5.2.2 Liens. Neither Borrower nor Operating Lessee shall create, incur, 
assume or suffer to exist any Lien on any portion of the Property or permit 
any such action to be taken, except for Permitted Encumbrances. Borrower or 
Operating Lessee, at its own expense, may contest, by appropriate legal 
proceeding, promptly initiated and conducted in good faith and with due 
diligence, any such Lien on any portion of the Property, provided that (i) 
no Default or Event of Default has occurred and remains uncured; (ii) such 
proceeding shall be permitted under and be conducted in accordance with the 
provisions of any other instrument to which Borrower or Operating Lessee is 
subject and shall not constitute a default thereunder and such proceeding

ordinances; (iii) neither the Property nor any part thereof or interest 
therein will be in danger of being sold, forfeited, terminated, cancelled

to Lender. Lender may pay over any such cash deposit or part thereof held 
by Lender to the claimant entitled thereto at any time when, in the 
reasonable judgment of Lender, the entitlement of such claimant is 
established or the Property (or part thereof or interest therein) shall be 
in imminent danger of being sold, forfeited, terminated, cancelled or lost 
or there shall be any danger of the Lien of the Mortgage being primed by 
any related Lien.

transactions, all or substantially all of its properties or assets except 
to the extent permitted by the Loan Documents, (d) modify or amend in any 
material respect, waive or terminate its Organizational Documents or its

scope or nature of its business objectives, purposes or operations, or 
undertake or participate in activities other than the continuance of its 
present business. Nothing contained in
 
-112-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
this Section 5.2.4 is intended to expand the rights of Borrower contained 
in Section 5.2.10 hereof, and for the avoidance of doubt, the rights of 
Borrower to effectuate Transfers is governed solely by Section 5.2.10 
hereof.

5.2.5 Debt Cancellation. Neither Borrower nor Operating Lessee shall cancel 
or otherwise forgive or release any claim or debt which is in excess of 
$100,000 (other than termination of Leases in accordance herewith or the 
forgiveness in the ordinary course of Borrowers or Operating Lessees 
business of Rent in arrears in connection with a settlement with a Tenant 
under a Lease, provided that in the case of a Material Lease, the amount of 
Rent so forgiven is less than the aggregate amount of two (2) months basic 
Rent under such Material Lease) owed to Borrower or Operating Lessee by any 
Person, except for adequate consideration and in the ordinary course of 
Borrowers or Operating Lessees business.

consent to any zoning reclassification of any portion of the Property or 
seek any variance under any existing zoning ordinance or use or permit the

applicable land use law, rule or regulation, without the prior written 
consent of Lender.

suffer, permit or initiate the joint assessment of the Property (a) with

with respect to each Intercompany Loan:

(a) such Intercompany Loan shall be fully subordinate to the Loan;

(b) such Intercompany Loan shall be non-recourse to Borrower and any of its 
assets, including all of its right, title and interest in the Property, and 
amounts payable pursuant to such Intercompany Loan shall be only permitted

required pursuant to the Loan Documents;

(c) any vote on account of a claim arising from such Intercompany Loan with 
respect to any plan of reorganization in a bankruptcy proceeding involving

or remedies to collect all or a portion of such Intercompany Loan while the

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(f) such Intercompany Loan shall be made on arms length terms;

(g) any payment from Borrower to Operating Lessee under such Intercompany 
Loan shall be made by Borrower to the Operating Lessee Operating Account.

In the event of a conflict between any provision set forth in this Section 
5.2.8 and any other provision in this Agreement, the former shall govern 
and control.

5.2.9 ERISA. (a) Assuming compliance by the Lender with paragraph (d) of 
this Section 5.2.9, Borrower shall not engage in any transactions 
contemplated under this Agreement which would cause any obligation, or 
action taken or to be taken, hereunder (or the exercise by Lender of any of 
its rights under the Note, this Agreement or the other Loan Documents) to 
be a non-exempt (under a statutory or administrative class exemption) 
prohibited transaction under Section 406(a) of ERISA.

(b) Intentionally omitted.

(c) Borrower further covenants and agrees if any employee benefit plan, 
whether or not subject to Title I of ERISA, holds an equity investment in 
Borrower or Guarantor, Borrower shall deliver to Lender such certifications 
from time to time throughout the term of the Loan, as requested by Lender 
in its sole discretion, but not more frequently than once per calendar 
year, and on no less than thirty (30) Business Days advance written notice 
(but in no event shall Borrowers failure to perform this Section 5.2.9(c) 
constitute an Event of Default), that Borrower is not subject to any state 
statutes regulating investments and fiduciary obligations with respect to 
governmental plans and that one or more of the following circumstances with 
respect to Borrower is true:

(i) Equity interests in Borrower or Borrowers applicable corporate parent 
are publicly offered securities, within the meaning of 29 C.F.R. 
§2510.3-101(b)(2);

(ii) Less than twenty-five percent (25%) of each outstanding class of 
equity interests in Borrower or Borrowers applicable corporate parent are 
held by benefit plan investors within the meaning of 29 C.F.R. 
§2510.3-101(b)(2), as modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA; or

(iii) Borrower or Borrowers applicable corporate parent qualifies as an 
operating company or a real estate operating company within the meaning 
of 29 C.F.R. §2510.3-101(c) or (e) or another exception to ERISA applies 
such that Borrowers assets or Borrowers applicable corporate parents 
assets should not constitute plan assets of any benefit plan investor 
within the meaning of Section 3(42) of ERISA and the regulations 
promulgated thereunder.

(d) Lender represents and warrants that, throughout the term of the Loan, 
no portion of the assets used by any Lender in connection with the 
transactions contemplated under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents 
constitutes assets of a (i) benefit plan investor within the meaning of 
the Plan Asset Regulations unless the applicable Lender is relying on an 
available prohibited transaction exemption, all of the conditions of which 
are and continue to be satisfied or (ii) governmental plan (as defined in 
Section 3(32) of ERISA) which is subject to any
 
-114-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
provision which is substantially similar to the prohibited transaction 
provisions of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (
Applicable Similar Law), unless the acquisition and holding of the Loan or 
any interest therein will not give rise to a violation of any such 
Applicable Similar Law.

(e) Borrower, Operating Lessee and Guarantor will fund or cause to be 
funded any Plan established or maintained by Borrower, Operating Lessee, 
Guarantor, or any ERISA Affiliate, as the case may be, in amounts necessary

Sections 412 or 430 of the Internal Revenue Code or Section 302 of ERISA 
(whether or not such standards are waived). As soon as possible and in any 
event within ten (10) days after Borrower or Operating Lessee knows that 
any ERISA Event has occurred with respect to any Plan, Lender will be 
provided with a statement, signed by an Authorized Representative of 
Borrower, Operating Lessee and/or Guarantor, describing said ERISA Event 
and the action which Borrower, Operating Lessee and/or Guarantor proposes 
to take with respect thereto.

5.2.10 Transfers. (a) Each of Borrower and Operating Lessee acknowledges 
that Lender has examined and relied on the experience of Borrower, 
Operating Lessee and their respective stockholders, general partners, 
members, principals and (if Borrower or Operating Lessee is a trust) 
beneficial owners in owning and operating properties such as the Property 
in agreeing to make the Loan, and will continue to rely on Borrowers 
ownership of the Property as a means of maintaining the value of the 
Property as security for repayment of the Debt and the performance of the 
Other Obligations. Borrower acknowledges that Lender has a valid interest 
in maintaining the value of the Property so as to ensure that, should 
Borrower default in the repayment of the Debt or the performance of the 
Other Obligations, Lender can recover the Debt by a sale of the Property.

(b) Without the prior written consent of Lender, Borrower and Operating 
Lessee shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Party to do any of 
the following (collectively, a Transfer): (i) sell, convey, mortgage, 
grant, bargain, encumber, pledge, assign, grant options with respect to, or 
otherwise transfer or dispose of (directly or indirectly, voluntarily or 
involuntarily, by operation of law or otherwise, and whether or not for 
consideration or of record) the Property or any part thereof or any legal 
or beneficial interest therein or (ii) permit a Sale or Pledge of an 
interest in any Restricted Party, in each case, other than any Transfer 
which constitutes a Permitted Transfer.

(c) A Transfer shall include, but not be limited to, (i) an installment 
sales agreement wherein Borrower agrees to sell the Property or any part 
thereof for a price to be paid in installments; (ii) an agreement by 
Borrower or Operating Lessee leasing all or a substantial part of the 
Property for other than actual occupancy by a space Tenant thereunder or a 
sale, assignment or other transfer of, or the grant of a security interest 
in, Borrowers or Operating Lessees right, title and interest in and to 
any Leases or any Rents; (iii) if a Restricted Party is a corporation, any 
merger, consolidation or Sale or Pledge of such corporations stock or the 
creation or issuance of new stock; (iv) if a Restricted Party is a limited 
or general partnership or joint venture, any merger or consolidation or the 
change, removal, resignation or addition of a general partner or the Sale 
or Pledge of the partnership interest of any general partner or any profits 
or proceeds relating to such partnership interest, or the Sale or Pledge of 
limited
 
-115-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
partnership interests or any profits or proceeds relating to such limited 
partnership interest or the creation or issuance of new limited partnership 
interests; (v) if a Restricted Party is a limited liability company, any 
merger or consolidation or the change, removal, resignation or addition of 
a managing member or non-member manager (or if no managing member, any 
member) or the Sale or Pledge of the membership interest of a managing 
member (or if no managing member, any member) or any profits or proceeds 
relating to such membership interest, or the Sale or Pledge of non-managing 
membership interests or the creation or issuance of new non-managing 
membership interests or (vi) if a Restricted Party is a trust or nominee 
trust, any merger, consolidation or the Sale or Pledge of the legal or 
beneficial interest in a Restricted Party or the creation or issuance of 
new legal or beneficial interests.

(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 5.2.10, the following 
shall not be deemed to be a Transfer (and, as such, may be consummated 
without the prior consent of Lender, any Rating Agency Confirmation (other 
than, with respect to subsection (i) below, as set forth in the 
Restructuring Conditions) or the payment of any fee in connection 
therewith, but subject to the satisfaction of any conditions and 
requirements expressly set forth herein with respect thereto):

(i) The Restructuring, provided that the Restructuring Conditions are 
satisfied prior to or substantially concurrently therewith or Borrower 
otherwise receives the consent of Lender and a Rating Agency Confirmation.

(ii) The Sale or Pledge, in one or a series of transactions, of the direct 
or indirect equity interests in Borrower or any other Restricted Party; 
provided, that, (A) after giving effect to such Sale or Pledge, Guarantor 
shall (x) own not less than fifty and one tenths percent (50.1%) of the 
economic and direct or indirect legal and beneficial interests in Borrower 
and Operating Lessee (on a look-through basis) and (y) Control Borrower and 
Operating Lessee, (B) upon the written request of Lender, Borrower shall 
deliver to Lender notice of each Sale or Pledge described in this Section 
5.2.10(d)(ii) not less than ten (10) days following such request, (C) no 
Sale or Pledge of any direct equity interest in Borrower, Operating Lessee 
or Principal shall be permitted, (D) no pledge of any direct equity 
interest of any Restricted Party that is not Borrower, Operating Lessee or 
Principal (such entities being subject to the prohibition set forth in the 
foregoing clause (C)) shall be permitted unless such Restricted Party has 
material other assets (including equity interests owned by such Restricted 
Party directly and/or through its subsidiaries) that are in addition to its 
direct or indirect ownership interests in Borrower, Operating Lessee or 
Principal (i.e., no such pledge shall be permitted unless the Restricted 
Party being pledged directly or indirectly owns material assets in excess 
of its indirect interests in the Property), (E) after giving effect to such 
Sale or Pledge, Borrower and Operating Lessee shall continue to be a 
Special Purpose Entity, and (F) the proposed transferee(s) in connection 
with such Sale or Pledge shall satisfy Lenders then current know your 
customer requirements (provided that such requirement shall be applied 
consistent with the requirements that are then applied by Lender to all 
prospective borrowers of similar size and type and relating to similar 
transactions) and Lender shall have received Satisfactory Search Results 
with respect to each such proposed transferee (and owners of its direct or 
indirect equity interests) which will own, following the consummation of 
the Sale or Pledge, a ten percent (10%) or greater equity interest 
(directly or indirectly) in
 
-116-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Borrower or Operating Lessee after giving effect to such Transfer. If after 
giving effect to any such Sale or Pledge, more than forty-nine percent 
(49%) in the aggregate of direct or indirect interests in a Restricted 
Party are owned by any Person and its Affiliates that owned less than 
forty-nine percent (49%) direct or indirect interest in such Restricted 
Party as of the Closing Date, Borrower shall deliver to Lender an 
Additional Insolvency Opinion.

(iii) Any Sale or Pledge of any direct or indirect legal or beneficial 
ownership interest in any Excluded Entity.

(e) No Transfer of the Property or any portion thereof or any direct or 
indirect legal or beneficial direct or indirect interest in Borrower or 
Operating Lessee (in each case, other than a Permitted Transfer) shall 
occur during the period that is one hundred twenty (120) days prior to, and 
sixty (60) days after, a Securitization. After such period and without 
limitation to the right to consummate any Permitted Transfer (which, for 
the avoidance of doubt shall not be governed or restricted by this Section 
5.2.10(e)), a Transfer of (i) the Property or (ii) all of the direct 
interests in Borrower and Operating Lessee (unless the Operating Lease is 
terminated in connection with such Transfer), or, if applicable to Borrower 
or Operating Lessee or the Principal with respect thereto, including any 
such Transfer effectuated pursuant to a merger (any Transfer referenced in 
the foregoing clause (i) or clause (ii), a Permitted Assumption), shall 
be permitted without Lenders consent, provided that Lender receives not 
less than thirty (30) days prior written notice of such Permitted 
Assumption and no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at the 
time such Permitted Assumption is consummated, and further provided that 
the following additional requirements are satisfied:

(i) Borrower shall pay Lender a transfer fee equal to $250,000.00;

(ii) Borrower shall pay any and all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred 
by Lender in connection with such Permitted Assumption (including, without 
limitation, Lenders reasonable counsel fees and disbursements and all 
recording fees, title insurance premiums and mortgage and intangible taxes 
and the fees and expenses of the Approved Rating Agencies);

(iii) Each proposed transferee (individually and/or collectively, as the 
context may dictate, the Transferee) must be (A) a Qualified Transferee 
or (B) at least fifty-one percent (51%) owned (directly or indirectly) and 
Controlled by a Qualified Transferee;

(iv) With respect to a Transfer of the Property rather than by Transfer of 
the legal or beneficial direct or indirect interests in Borrower and 
Operating Lessee (unless the Operating Lease is terminated in connection 
with such Transfer), if applicable, the Transferee to which the Property is 
conveyed shall assume all of the obligations of Borrower and Operating 
Lessee (unless the Operating Lease is terminated in connection therewith) 
under the Loan Documents in a manner reasonably satisfactory to Lender, 
including, without limitation, by entering into an assumption agreement in 
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Lender;
 
-117-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(v) The Transferee and the Transferees principals that Control the 
Transferee (the Related Entities) must be able to satisfy all the 
representations and covenants set forth in Sections 4.1.35, 5.1.25 and 
5.2.9 of this Agreement, and the Transferee and the Related Entities shall 
deliver (A) all organizational documentation reasonably requested by 
Lender, which shall be reasonably satisfactory to Lender and, following a 
Securitization, satisfactory to the Approved Rating Agencies, and (B) all 
certificates and agreements necessary to evidence the Permitted Assumption 
and a due authority, execution and enforceability opinion reasonably 
acceptable to Lender;

(vi) The Transferee and each owner of an equity interest (directly or 
indirectly) in the Transferee which will, following the consummation of the 
Permitted Assumption, own a ten percent (10%) or greater equity interest 
(directly or indirectly) in Borrower or Operating Lessee (unless the 
Operating Lease is terminated in connection with such Permitted Assumption) 
shall satisfy Lenders then current know your customer requirements 
(provided that such requirement shall be applied consistent with the 
requirements that are then applied by Lender to all prospective borrowers 
of similar size and type and relating to similar transactions) and Lender 
shall have received Satisfactory Search Results with respect to Transferee 
(and owners of its direct or indirect equity interests) which will own, 
following the consummation of the Permitted Assumption, a ten percent (10%) 
or greater equity interest (directly or indirectly) in Borrower or 
Operating Lessee (unless the Operating Lease is terminated in connection 
with such Permitted Assumption) after giving effect to such Permitted 
Assumption;

(vii) Borrower or Transferee, at its sole cost and expense, shall deliver 
to Lender an Additional Insolvency Opinion reflecting such Transfer;

(viii) There shall be no material litigation relating to the 
creditworthiness of the Transferee or any Related Entity thereof or any 
regulatory action pending against Transferee or any Related Entities, in 
each case, which could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse

Entity;

(ix) If, in connection with the Permitted Assumption, Guarantor no longer 
owns a direct or indirect interest in Borrower or Operating Lessee (unless 
the Operating Lease is terminated in connection with such Transfer), one 
(1) or more Qualified Transferees (as applicable, the Replacement 
Guarantor) shall have assumed all of the liabilities and obligations of 
Guarantor arising under the Guaranty after the date of such Transfer (but 
not any which may have accrued prior thereto) or execute a Replacement 
Guaranty;

(x) If the Permitted Assumption is accomplished by deed or conveyance of 
the Property rather than by a Transfer of the legal or beneficial direct or 
indirect interests in Borrower and Operating Lessee (unless the Operating 
Lease is terminated in connection with such Transfer), if applicable, 
Borrower shall deliver, at its sole cost and expense, an endorsement to the 
Title Insurance Policy, as modified by the assumption agreement, as a valid 
first lien on the Property and naming the Transferee as owner of the 
Property, which endorsement shall insure that, as of the date of the 
recording of the
 
-118-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
assumption agreement, the Property shall not be subject to any additional 
exceptions or liens other than those contained in the Title Insurance 
Policy and any other Permitted Encumbrances;

(xi) The receipt by Lender of a Rating Agency Confirmation with respect to 
such Permitted Assumption; and

(xii) The Property shall be managed by a Qualified Manager pursuant to the 
Management Agreement and a Qualified R&A Manager pursuant to any 
Replacement R&A Management Agreement.

Immediately upon a Transfer of the Property and the satisfaction of all of 
the above requirements, Borrower and Operating Lessee shall be released 
from all liability under this Agreement, the Note, the Mortgage and the 
other Loan Documents for acts or omissions occurring after such Transfer. 
The foregoing release shall be effective upon the date such Permitted 
Assumption is consummated, but Lender agrees to provide written evidence 
thereof reasonably requested by Borrower.

(f) In the case of a Transfer that is a Permitted Assumption pursuant to 
Section 5.2.10(e), Guarantor shall be released from the Guaranty for all 
liability arising after the date of such Transfer upon (i) an assumption of 
the Guaranty by the Replacement Guarantor pursuant to Section 
5.2.10(e)(ix) or (ii) the execution by the Replacement Guarantor of a 
replacement guaranty, in form and substance that is the same as the 
Guaranty, covering all liability arising after the date of such Transfer 
(but not any which may have accrued prior thereto) (a Replacement Guaranty
).

(g) Lender shall not be required to demonstrate any actual impairment of 
its security or any increased risk of default hereunder in order to declare 
the Debt immediately due and payable upon the consummation of any Transfer 
in violation of this Section 5.2.10. This provision shall apply to every 
Transfer regardless of whether voluntary or not, or whether or not Lender 
has consented to any previous Transfer.

5.2.11 Ground Lease. (a) Intentionally omitted.

(b) Borrower shall not waive, excuse, condone or in any way release or 
discharge Ground Lessor under the Ground Lease of or from Ground Lessors 
material obligations, covenant and/or conditions under the Ground Lease 
without the prior written consent of Lender (which consent will not be 
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

(c) For so long as the Ground Lease Parcel is part of the Property that is 
subject to the Mortgage, Borrower shall not, without Lenders prior written 
consent, surrender, terminate, forfeit, or suffer or permit the surrender, 
termination or forfeiture of, or change, modify or amend in a material 
adverse manner, the Ground Lease, other than an expiration of the Ground 
Lease pursuant to its terms. Consent to one amendment, change, agreement or 
modification shall not be deemed to be a waiver of the right to require 
consent to other, future or successive amendments, changes, agreements or 
modifications. Any acquisition of Ground Lessors interest in the Ground 
Lease by Borrower or any Affiliate of Borrower shall be accomplished by 
Borrower in such a manner so as to avoid a merger of the interests of 
lessor and lessee in the Ground Lease, unless consent to such merger is 
granted by Lender.
 
-119-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.2.12 Condominium Documents. Borrower shall not, without Lenders prior 
written consent, vote to amend, modify, supplement or terminate, or consent 
to (a) the termination of any of the Condominium Documents or (b) the 
amendment, modification or supplementation of any of the Condominium 
Documents in any material respect which would have a Material Adverse 
Effect or materially and adversely affect Lenders rights under the 
Condominium Documents. Without the prior written consent of the Lender, 
Borrower shall not vote to approve any of the following matters in 
connection with the Condominium (unless expressly required under the 
Condominium Documents): (i) any material and adverse change in the nature 
and amount of any insurance covering all or a part of the Condominium and 
the disposition of any proceeds thereof, but only to the extent any of the 
foregoing violates the Loan Documents; (ii) the manner in which any 
condemnation or threat of condemnation of all or a part of the Property 
shall be defended or settled and the disposition of any award or settlement 
in connection therewith, but only to the extent the foregoing violates the 
Loan Documents; (iii) any amendment to the Condominium Documents which by 
their terms requires the consent of Lender and any removal of any portion 
of the Property from the provisions of the Condominium Law; (iv) the 
creation of, or any change in, any private restrictive covenant, zoning 
ordinance, or other public or private restrictions, now or hereafter 
limiting or defining the uses which may be made of the Property or any part 
thereof or (v) any material relocation of the boundaries of the Property.

5.2.13 Affiliate Transactions. None of Borrower, Operating Lessee or 
Principal may enter into or be a party to, and will not enter into or be a 
party to, any transaction with its partners, members, shareholders or 
Affiliates except in the ordinary course of its business and on terms which 
are commercially reasonable and are no less favorable to it than would be 
obtained in a comparable arms length transaction with an unrelated third 
party. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in the foregoing shall be deemed 
to apply to (i) the R&A Management Agreement or (ii) Transfers between 
Affiliates of any direct or indirect ownership interest in Borrower or 
Operating Lessee, which Transfers shall governed solely by Section 5.2.10.

5.2.14 Operating Lease. Without Lenders prior written consent, neither 
Borrower nor Operating Lessee shall (a) surrender, terminate or cancel the 
Operating Lease, (b) release any of its respective material rights and 
remedies under the Operating Lease if the same would have a Material 
Adverse Effect, (c) modify, change, supplement, alter or amend the 
Operating Lease if the same would have, or reasonably be expected to have, 
a Material Adverse Effect or (d) waive, excuse, condone or in any way 
release or discharge the other party of or from its material obligations, 
covenants and/or conditions under the Operating Lease if the same would 
have a Material Adverse Effect.

ARTICLE VI

INSURANCE; CASUALTY; CONDEMNATION

Section 6.1 Insurance. (a) Borrower or Operating Lessee shall obtain and 
maintain, or cause to be maintained, insurance for Borrower, Operating 
Lessee and the Property providing at least the following coverages:

(i) comprehensive all risk special form insurance including, but not 
limited to, loss caused by any type of windstorm or hail, on the 
Improvements and the Personal Property, (A) in an amount equal to the 
lesser of (1) one hundred percent (100%) of the Full Replacement Cost, 
which for purposes of this Agreement shall mean actual replacement value 
(exclusive of costs of excavations, foundations, underground utilities and 
footings) and (2) $1,300,000,000 per occurrence, in each case, with a 
waiver of depreciation; (B) waiving all co insurance provisions or to be 
written on a no co insurance form; (C) providing no deductible greater than 
$500,000 per occurrence; Borrower and/or Operating Lessee may utilize a 
$5,000,000 aggregate deductible (basket aggregate) in conjunction with a 
per occurrence deductible which will not exceed $500,000 per occurrence 
except with respect to flood, windstorm and earthquake coverage, providing 
for a deductible not to exceed five percent (5%) of the total insurable 
value of the Property (the Base Deductible), subject to a $1,000,000 
minimum; provided, however, that Borrower and/or Operating Lessee shall be 
permitted to maintain a maximum deductible with respect to flood, windstorm 
and earthquake coverage of fifteen percent (15%) of the total insurable 
value of the Property (the Increased Deductible) if Guarantor delivers 
the Deductible Guaranty, guaranteeing any failure by Borrower and/or 
Operating Lessee to pay its obligations (the Guaranteed Excess Deductible 
Obligations) actually incurred with respect to that portion of the 
Increased Deductible which exceeds the Base Deductible and not otherwise 
insured by a third-party provider (such difference, the Excess Deductible
) and, except that, with respect to the Increased Deductible for flood 
coverage, Borrower shall not increase the amounts of such Increased 
Deductible or lower the positions of such Increased Deductible amounts 
below the current positions which are in place as of the Closing Date; and 
(D) if any of the Improvements or the use of the Property shall at any time 
constitute legal non-conforming structures or uses, coverage for loss to 
the undamaged portion in an amount equal to the amount required pursuant to 
clause (A) hereinabove for the undamaged portion and for coverage for 
demolition costs and coverage for increased costs of construction provide a 
combined minimum limit of $250,000,000 per occurrence. In addition, 
Borrower and/or Operating Lessee shall obtain: (y) flood insurance, 
including tsunami, in amounts acceptable to Lender, except that for the 
Property where any portion of the Improvements is currently or at any time 
in the future located in a federally designated special flood hazard 
area, flood insurance shall include the maximum amount of such insurance 
available under the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, the Flood 
Disaster Protection Act of 1973 or the National Flood Insurance Reform Act 
of 1994, as each may be amended. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the 
event the limits provided with respect to flood are eroded by five percent 
(5%) or more due to claims, Borrower and/or Operating Lessee shall 
reinstate the available flood limits within ninety (90) days to the limits 
in place as of the Closing Date, and (z) earthquake insurance,
 
-121-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
including earth movement due to volcanic eruption, in an amount acceptable 
to Lender; provided that the insurance pursuant to clauses (y) and (z) 
hereof shall be on terms consistent with the comprehensive all risk 
insurance policy required under this subsection (i). Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, subject to Rating Agency approval, Borrower and/or Operating 
Lessee shall be permitted to provide coverage for named windstorm in an 
amount equal to the greater of (1) $500,000,000 per occurrence and (2) the 
1,000-year Probable Maximum Loss as indicated in a risk analysis for all 
high risk locations under the Policy (such analysis to be approved by 
Lender and Rating Agencies and secured by Borrower and/or Operating Lessee 
utilizing a third-party engineering firm qualified to perform such risk 
analysis using the most current RMS software, or its equivalent, to include 
consideration of storm surge and loss amplification, at the expense of 
Borrower and/or Operating Lessee). The risk analyses for windstorm required 
pursuant to this subsection (i) shall be referred to herein as an 
Acceptable Risk Analysis;

(ii) business income or rental loss insurance (A) with loss payable to 
Lender; (B) covering all risks required to be covered by the insurance 
provided for in subsection (i) above; (C) in an amount equal to one hundred 
percent (100%) of the projected gross revenues from the operation of the 
Property (as reduced to reflect expenses not incurred during a period of 
Restoration) on an actual loss sustained basis for the entire period of 
Restoration or for a twenty-four (24) month period of indemnity; and (D) 
containing an extended period of indemnity endorsement which provides that 
after the physical loss to the Improvements and Personal Property has been 
repaired, the continued loss of income will be insured until such income 
either returns to the same level it was at prior to the loss, or the 
expiration of six (6) months from the date that the Property is repaired or 
replaced and operations are resumed, whichever first occurs, and 
notwithstanding that the policy may expire prior to the end of such period. 
The amount of such business income or rental loss insurance shall be 
determined prior to the date hereof and at least once each year thereafter 
based on Borrowers and/or Operating Lessees reasonable estimate of the 
gross revenues from the Property (as reduced to reflect expenses not 
incurred during a period of Restoration) for the succeeding twelve (12) 
month period. All proceeds payable to Lender pursuant to this subsection 
shall be held by Lender and nothing herein contained shall be deemed to 
relieve Borrower of its obligations to pay the obligations secured by the 
Loan Documents on the respective dates of payment provided for in this 
Agreement and the other Loan Documents except to the extent such amounts 
are actually paid out of the proceeds of such business income insurance;

(iii) at all times during which structural construction, repairs or 
alterations are being made with respect to the Improvements, and only if 
the Property coverage form does not otherwise apply, (A) owners contingent 
or protective liability insurance (or an equivalent) covering claims not 
covered by or under the terms or provisions of the below mentioned 
commercial general liability insurance policy and (B) the insurance 
provided for in subsection (i) above written in a so called builders risk 
completed value form (1) on a non-reporting basis, (2) against all risks 
insured against pursuant to subsection (i) above, (3) including permission 
to occupy the Property and (4) with an agreed amount endorsement waiving co 
insurance provisions;
 
-122-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(iv) comprehensive boiler and machinery insurance, if steam boilers or 
other pressure fixed vessels are in operation, in an amount not less than 
$50,000,000 on terms consistent with the commercial property insurance 
policy required under subsection (i) above;

(v) commercial general liability insurance against claims for personal 
injury, bodily injury, death or property damage occurring upon, in or about 
the Property, such insurance (A) to be on the so called occurrence form 
with a combined limit of not less than $1,500,000.00 in the aggregate and 
$1,000,000.00 per occurrence; including a self-insured retention of not 
greater than $500,000.00; (B) to continue at not less than the aforesaid 
limit until required to be changed by Lender in writing by reason of 
changed economic conditions making such protection inadequate and (C) to 
cover at least the following hazards: (1) premises and operations; (2) 
products and completed operations on an if any basis; (3) independent 
contractors; (4) contractual liability for all insured contracts and (5) 
contractual liability covering the indemnities contained in Section 9 of 
the Mortgage to the extent the same is insurable;

(vi) if applicable, automobile liability coverage for all owned and 
non-owned vehicles, including rented and leased vehicles containing minimum 
limits per occurrence of $1,000,000.00;

(vii) if applicable, workers compensation and employers liability subject 
to the workers compensation laws of the applicable state;

(viii) umbrella/excess liability insurance in an amount not less than 
$100,000,000.00 per occurrence and in the aggregate on terms consistent 
with the commercial general liability insurance policy required under 
subsection (v) above, and including, but not limited to, supplemental 
coverage for employers liability, liquor liability and automobile 
liability, which umbrella liability coverage shall apply in excess of such 
supplemental coverage;

(ix) the insurance required under this Section 6.1(a)(i), (ii), (v) and 
(viii) above shall include Terrorism Coverage, or if excluded from the 
policies required above, coverage for the peril of terrorism and acts of 
terrorism shall be provided through a separate policy acceptable to Lender 
and Borrower and/or Operating Lessee shall maintain insurance for loss 
resulting from perils and acts of terrorism on terms (including amounts) 
consistent with those required under Section 6.1(a)(i), (ii), (v) and 
(viii) above at all times during the term of the Loan. For so long as 
TRIPRA or a subsequent statute, extension or reauthorization thereof, is in 
effect and continues to cover both foreign and domestic acts, Lender shall 
accept terrorism insurance with coverage against acts which are certified 
within the meaning of TRIPRA. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the amount of 
terrorism coverage that shall be required for the Policies required in 
Section 6.1(a)(i) and (ii) above shall be in an amount equal to the lesser 
of (1) the amounts required for the Property pursuant to Section 6.1(a)(i) 
and (2) $1,275,000,000 (provided that, in the event such limit is an annual 
aggregate and said limit is eroded by five percent (5%) or more due to 
claims, Borrower shall reinstate the available limits within ninety (90) 
days to the limits required herein). If (A) TRIPRA or a similar or
 
-123-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
subsequent statute, extension or reauthorization thereof is not in effect, 
(B) TRIPRA or a similar or subsequent statute, extension or reauthorization 
is modified which results in a material increase in terrorism insurance 
premiums, or (C) there is a disruption in the terrorism insurance 
marketplace as the result of a terrorism event which results in a material 
increase in terrorism insurance premiums for properties located in the 
United States, then provided that terrorism insurance is commercially 
available, Borrower and/or Operating Lessee shall be required to carry 
terrorism insurance throughout the term of the Loan as required by the 
preceding sentence, but in such event Borrower and/or Operating Lessee 
shall not be required to spend on terrorism insurance coverage more than 
two times the amount of the insurance premium that is payable at such time 
in respect of the property and business interruption/rental loss insurance 
required hereunder (without giving effect to the cost of the terrorism, 
earthquake and windstorm components of such casualty and business 
interruption/rental loss insurance), and if the cost of terrorism insurance 
exceeds such amount, Borrower and/or Operating Lessee shall purchase the 
maximum amount of terrorism insurance available with funds equal to such 
amount;

(x) Employment Practices Liability, including third party coverage, in an 
amount not less than $5,000,000:

(xi) Crime coverage in amounts not less than $5,000,000;

(xii) Liquor Liability in amounts not less than $1,000,000 per occurrence 
and to be included in the umbrella/excess liability insurance required in 
subsection (viii) above;

(xiii) environmental insurance against claims for pollution and remediation 
legal liability related to the Property (PLL Policy) as follows: (A) to 
be a claims made and reported policy for an initial term of ten (10) years 
and such PLL Policy shall either be extended or replaced with an equivalent 
PLL Policy or Borrower shall purchase the optional extended reporting 
period of two (2) years in accordance with the terms and conditions of the 
PLL Policy such that, in either case, the PLL Policy shall be in effect 
until two (2) years past the Maturity Date; (B) with limits of liability of 
$10,000,000 for each Pollution Condition and $25,000,000 in the aggregate; 
(C) with a self-insured retention amount of $50,000 for each Pollution 
Condition; (D) shall name the Lender as an additional named insured per 
Mortgagee Assignment endorsements providing automatic rights of assignment 
in the event of defaults; (E) Borrower and/or Operating Lessee shall not be 
permitted to add any additional locations during the PLL Policy term; and 
(F) shall, throughout the PLL Policy term, include the same coverages, 
terms, conditions and endorsements (and shall not be amended in any way 
without the prior written consent of Lender) as the PLL Policy approved as 
of the Closing Date; and

(xiv) upon sixty (60) days written notice, such other reasonable insurance 
and in such reasonable amounts as Lender from time to time may reasonably 
request against such other insurable hazards which at the time are commonly 
insured against for property similar to the Property located in or around 
the region in which the Property is located.

(b) All insurance provided for in Section 6.1(a) hereof, shall be obtained 
under valid and enforceable policies (collectively, the Policies or in 
the singular, the Policy),
 
-124-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
and shall be subject to the approval of Lender as to insurance companies, 
amounts, deductibles, loss payees and insureds. The Policies shall be 
issued by financially sound and responsible insurance companies having a 
rating of (1) A or better (or its equivalent) by S&P, Fitch (if Fitch is 
rating the Securitization and is rating the insurance company) and Moodys 
(if Moodys is rating the Securitization and is rating the insurance 
company) provided, however, that if Borrower and/or Operating Lessee elects 
to have its insurance coverage provided by a syndicate of insurers, then, 
if such syndicate consists of five (5) or more members, (A) at least sixty 
percent (60%) of the insurance coverage (or seventy-five percent (75%) if 
such syndicate consists of four (4) or fewer members) and one hundred 
percent (100%) of the first layer of insurance coverage shall be provided 
by insurance companies having a claims paying ability rating of A or 
better (or its equivalent) by S&P, Fitch (if Fitch is rating the 
Securitization and is rating the insurance company) and Moodys (if Moodys 
is rating the Securitization and is rating the insurance company) and (B) 
the remaining forty percent (40%) of the insurance coverage (or the 
remaining twenty-five percent (25%) if such syndicate consists of four (4) 
or fewer members) shall be provided by insurance companies having a claims 
paying ability rating of BBB+ or better (or its equivalent) by S&P, Fitch 
(if Fitch is rating the Securitization and is rating the insurance company) 
and Moodys (if Moodys is rating the Securitization and is rating the 
insurance company) and (2) A VIII or better by AM Best. Notwithstanding 
the foregoing, Borrower shall be permitted to maintain a portion of the 
coverage with United Specialty Insurance Company (United) in their 
current participation amounts and positions within the syndicate provided 
that Borrower obtains reinsurance with a cut-through endorsement, 
acceptable to Lender and the Rating Agencies, with respect to United from 
an insurance company which shall be rated at least A with S&P and A2 
with Moodys, to the extent Moodys rates the Securities and rates the 
applicable insurance company, or such higher rating as may be required by a 
Rating Agency, not to exceed A+ with S&P and A1 with Moodys, to the 
extent Moodys rates the Securities and rates the applicable insurance 
company. The Policies described in Section 6.1 hereof (other than those 
strictly limited to liability protection) shall designate Lender as loss 
payee. Prior to the expiration dates of the Policies theretofore furnished 
to Lender, evidence that the Policies shall continue in force 
uninterrupted, to be followed by evidence satisfactory to Lender of payment 
of the premiums due thereunder (the Insurance Premiums) as such Insurance 
Premiums shall become due and payable, shall be delivered by Borrower to 
Lender.

(c) Any blanket insurance Policy shall specifically allocate to the 
Property the amount of coverage from time to time required hereunder or 
shall otherwise provide the same protection as would a separate Policy 
insuring only the Property in compliance with the provisions of Section 
6.1(a) hereof. In the event Borrower and/or Operating Lessee adds any 
locations to the Policy that are subject to the perils of earthquake, flood 
or wind/named storm, Borrower shall notify Lender and provide updated 
Acceptable Risk Analyses as applicable and the limits provided for such 
perils shall be increased as necessary so as to be in compliance with the 
requirements of Section 6.1. In the event Borrower and/or Operating Lessee 
adds any locations to the Policy providing coverage for terrorism which is 
within a 1,000 foot radius (the Radius) of the Property, Borrower shall 
(1) increase the limits of any such Policy so that it shall be adequate to 
maintain the coverage set forth in this Section 6.1 for each property in 
the aggregate within the Radius that is covered by such blanket policy 
calculated on a total insured value basis or (2) provide the required 
coverage on a separate policy in compliance with the requirements of this 
Section 6.1.
 
-125-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(d) All Policies provided for or contemplated by Section 6.1(a) hereof 
shall name Borrower and Operating Lessee as named insureds and, in the case 
of liability policies, except for the Policy referenced in Section 
6.1(a)(vii) of this Agreement, shall name Lender as the additional insured, 
as its interests may appear, and in the case of property damage, including 
but not limited to terrorism, boiler and machinery, flood and earthquake 
insurance, shall contain a standard non-contributing mortgagee clause in 
favor of Lender providing that the loss thereunder shall be payable to 
Lender and guaranteeing thirty (30) days notice of cancellation to Lender 
except ten (10) days notice for non-payment of premium.

(e) All Policies shall contain clauses or endorsements to the effect that:

(i) no act or negligence of Borrower or Operating Lessee, or anyone acting 
for Borrower or Operating Lessee, or of any Tenant or other occupant, or 
failure to comply with the provisions of any Policy, which might otherwise 
result in a forfeiture of the insurance or any part thereof, shall in any 
way affect the validity or enforceability of the insurance insofar as 
Lender is concerned;

(ii) the Policy shall not be materially changed (other than to increase the 
coverage provided thereby) or canceled without at least thirty (30) days 
written notice to Lender and any other party named therein as an additional 
insured; provided, that ten (10) days notice will be required for 
non-payment of premium or; if issuer will not or cannot provide the notices 
required herein, Borrower shall be obligated to provide such notice;

(iii) the issuers thereof shall give ten (10) days written notice to 
Lender if the issuers of such Policy elect not to renew the Policy prior to 
its expiration or, if the issuers will not or cannot provide the notices 
required herein, Borrower shall be obligated to provide such notice; and

(iv) Lender shall not be liable for any Insurance Premiums thereon or 
subject to any assessments thereunder.

If at any time Lender is not in receipt of written evidence that all 
insurance required hereunder is in full force and effect, Lender shall have 
the right to take such action as Lender deems necessary to protect its 
interest in the Property, including, without limitation, the obtaining of 
such insurance coverage as Lender in its sole discretion deems appropriate 
after ten (10) Business Days notice to Borrower if prior to the date upon 
which any such coverage will lapse or at any time Lender deems necessary 
(regardless of prior notice to Borrower) to avoid the lapse of any such 
coverage. All premiums incurred by Lender in connection with such action or 
in obtaining such insurance and keeping it in effect shall be paid by 
Borrower to Lender upon demand and, until paid, shall be secured by the 
Mortgage and shall bear interest at the Default Rate.

Section 6.2 Casualty. If the Property shall be damaged or destroyed, in 
whole or in part, by fire or other casualty (a Casualty), Borrower or 
Operating Lessee shall give prompt written notice of such damage to Lender 
(provided that no notice shall be required in connection with a Casualty 
that is de minimis) and shall promptly commence and diligently prosecute 
the completion of the Restoration of the Property pursuant to Section 6.4 
hereof as nearly as possible to the condition the Property was in 
immediately prior to such Casualty, with
 
-126-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
such alterations as may be reasonably approved by Lender and otherwise in 
accordance with Section 6.4 hereof. Borrower shall pay all costs of such 
Restoration whether or not such costs are covered by insurance. Lender may, 
but shall not be obligated to make proof of loss if not made promptly by 
Borrower or Operating Lessee. In addition, Lender may participate in any 
settlement discussions with any insurance companies with respect to any 
Casualty in which the Net Proceeds or the costs of completing the 
Restoration are equal to or greater than the Casualty/Condemnation 
Threshold Amount and Borrower or Operating Lessee, as applicable, shall 
deliver to Lender all instruments required by Lender to permit such 
participation.

Section 6.3 Condemnation. (a) Borrower shall promptly give Lender notice of 
the actual or threatened commencement of any proceeding for the 
Condemnation of the Property and shall deliver to Lender copies of any and 
all papers served in connection with such proceedings. Lender may 
participate in any such proceedings, and Borrower or Operating Lessee, as 
applicable, shall from time to time deliver to Lender all instruments 
requested by it to permit such participation. Borrower or Operating Lessee 
shall, at its expense, diligently prosecute any such proceedings, and shall 
consult with Lender, its attorneys and experts, and cooperate with them in 
the carrying on or defense of any such proceedings. Notwithstanding any 
taking by any public or quasi-public authority through Condemnation or 
otherwise (including, but not limited to, any transfer made in lieu of or 
in anticipation of the exercise of such taking), Borrower shall continue to 
pay the Debt at the time and in the manner provided for its payment in the 
Note and in this Agreement and the Debt shall not be reduced until any 
Award shall have been actually received and applied by Lender, after the 
deduction of expenses of collection, to the reduction or discharge of the 
Debt. Lender shall not be limited to the interest paid on the Award by the 
condemning authority but shall be entitled to receive out of the Award 
interest at the rate or rates provided herein or in the Note. If the 
Property or any portion thereof is taken by a condemning authority, (a) if 
Restoration of the Property would be deemed feasible by a prudent Lender 
acting reasonably based upon the nature of the Condemnation, Borrower or 
Operating Lessee shall promptly commence and diligently prosecute the 
Restoration of the Property pursuant to Section 6.4 hereof and otherwise 
comply with the provisions of Section 6.4 hereof; provided, that, Borrower 
or Operating Lessee shall not be obligated to pursue completion of the 
Restoration if Lender is obligated to disburse Net Proceeds pursuant to 
Section 6.4 hereof with respect thereto (and Borrower or Operating Lessee 
has satisfied all applicable conditions to such disbursement) and Lender 
fails to disburse such proceeds and (b) if Restoration of the Property is 
not considered feasible by a prudent Lender acting reasonably based upon 
the nature of the Condemnation, then Lender shall apply the Net Proceeds of 
such Condemnation to the principal of the Loan in accordance with Section 
2.4.2 hereof. If the Property is sold, through foreclosure or otherwise, 
prior to the receipt by Lender of the Award, Lender shall have the right, 
whether or not a deficiency judgment on the Note shall have been sought, 
recovered or denied, to receive the Award, or a portion thereof sufficient 
to pay the Debt.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any 
other Loan Document, if the Loan or any portion thereof is included in a 
REMIC Trust and, immediately following a release of any portion of the Lien 
of the Mortgage in connection with a Condemnation of the Property (but 
taking into account any proposed Restoration on the remaining portion of 
the Property) (based solely on real property and excluding any personal 
property or going concern value), the Loan-to-Value Ratio is greater than 
125% (such value to be determined, in Lenders sole discretion, by any 
commercially reasonable method permitted to a
 
-127-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
REMIC Trust), the principal balance of the Loan must prepaid down by an 
amount not less than the least of the following amounts: (i) the 
Condemnation Proceeds, (ii) the fair market value of the released property 
at the time of the release, or (iii) an amount such that the Loan-to-Value 
Ratio (as so determined by Lender) does not increase after the release, 
unless Lender receives an opinion of counsel that if such amount is not 
paid, the Securitization will not fail to maintain its status as a REMIC 
Trust as a result of the related release of such portion of the Lien of the 
Mortgage. Any such prepayment shall be deemed a voluntary prepayment and 
shall be subject to Section 2.4.1 hereof (other than the requirements to 
prepay the Debt in full and provide thirty (30) days notice to Lender).

Section 6.4 Restoration. The following provisions shall apply in connection 
with the Restoration of the Property:

(a) If the Net Proceeds shall be less than the Casualty/Condemnation 
Threshold Amount and the costs of completing the Restoration shall be less 
than the Casualty/Condemnation Threshold Amount, the Net Proceeds will be 
disbursed by Lender to Borrower upon receipt, provided that all of the 
conditions set forth in Section 6.4(b)(i) (A), (C), (F), (G) and (H) 
hereof are met and Borrower delivers to Lender a written undertaking to 
expeditiously commence and to satisfactorily complete with due diligence 
the Restoration in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

(b) If the Net Proceeds are equal to or greater than the 
Casualty/Condemnation Threshold Amount or the costs of completing the 
Restoration is equal to or greater than the Casualty/Condemnation Threshold 
Amount, Lender shall make the Net Proceeds available for the Restoration in 
accordance with the provisions of this Section 6.4. The term Net Proceeds
 for purposes of this Section 6.4 shall mean: (i) the net amount of all 
insurance proceeds received by Lender pursuant to Section 6.1(a)(i), (iv), 
(ix) and (x) as a result of such damage or destruction, after deduction of 
the reasonable costs and expenses (including, but not limited to, 
reasonable counsel fees), if any, in collecting same (Insurance Proceeds
), or (ii) the net amount of the Award, after deduction of the reasonable 
costs and expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable counsel 
fees), if any, in collecting same (Condemnation Proceeds), whichever the 
case may be.

(i) The Net Proceeds shall be made available to Borrower or Operating 
Lessee for Restoration provided that each of the following conditions are 
met:

(A) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

(B) (1) in the event the Net Proceeds are Insurance Proceeds, less than 
thirty percent (30%) of the total floor area of the Improvements on the 
Property has been damaged, destroyed or rendered unusable as a result of 
such Casualty or (2) in the event the Net Proceeds are Condemnation 
Proceeds, less than twenty two and one half percent (22.5%) of the land 
constituting the Property is taken, and such land is located along the 
perimeter or periphery of the Property, and no portion of the Improvements 
is located on such land;
 
-128-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(C) Borrower or Operating Lessee shall commence the Restoration as soon as 
reasonably practicable (but in no event later than one hundred twenty (120) 
days after such Casualty or Condemnation, whichever the case may be, 
occurs) and shall diligently pursue the same to satisfactory completion, 
provided, that for purposes of this clause the filing of an application for 
a building permit for the Restoration shall be deemed to be commencement of 
the Restoration provided Borrower or Operating Lessee promptly commences 
work thereafter and diligently proceeds to the completion of such 
Restoration;

(D) Lender shall be satisfied that any operating deficits, including all 
scheduled payments of principal and interest under the Note, which will be 
incurred with respect to the Property as a result of the occurrence of any 
such Casualty or Condemnation, whichever the case may be, will be covered 
out of (1) the Net Proceeds, (2) the insurance coverage referred to in 
Section 6.1(a)(ii) hereof, if applicable, or (3) by other funds of Borrower 
or Operating Lessee;

(E) Lender shall be satisfied, subject to a force majeure delay, that the 
Restoration will be completed on or before the earliest to occur of (1) one 
hundred twenty (120) days prior to the Maturity Date, (2) such time as may 
be required under all applicable Legal Requirements in order to repair and 
restore the Property to the condition it was in immediately prior to such 
Casualty or to as nearly as possible the condition it was in immediately 
prior to such Condemnation, as applicable, or (3) the expiration of the 
insurance coverage referred to in Section 6.1(a)(ii) hereof;

(F) the Property and the use thereof after the Restoration will, in all 
material respects, be in compliance with and permitted under all applicable 
Legal Requirements (including as a legal non-conforming use);

(G) the Restoration shall be done and completed by Borrower or Operating 
Lessee in an expeditious and diligent fashion and in compliance with all 
applicable Legal Requirements;

(H) such Casualty or Condemnation, as applicable, does not result in the 
loss of access to the Property or the related Improvements;

(I) the Debt Yield immediately prior to such Casualty or Condemnation was 
equal to or greater than seven percent (7%);

(J) Borrower shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to Lender a signed 
detailed budget approved in writing by Borrowers or Operating Lessees 
architect or engineer stating the entire cost of completing the 
Restoration, which budget shall be reasonably approved by Lender in the 
same manner as each Annual Budget is to be approved by Lender during the 
continuance of a Cash Trap Period; and
 
-129-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(K) the Net Proceeds together with any cash or cash equivalent deposited by 
Borrower and/or Operating Lessee with Lender are sufficient in Lenders 
reasonable discretion to cover the cost of the Restoration.

(ii) The Net Proceeds shall be held by Lender in an interest bearing 
Eligible Account and, until disbursed in accordance with the provisions of 
this Section 6.4(b), shall constitute additional security for the Debt and 
Other Obligations under the Loan Documents. The Net Proceeds shall be 
disbursed by Lender to, or as directed by, Borrower or Operating Lessee 
from time to time during the course of the Restoration, upon receipt of 
evidence satisfactory to Lender that (A) all materials installed and work 
and labor performed (except to the extent that they are to be paid for out 
of the requested disbursement) in connection with the Restoration have been 
paid for in full, and (B) there exist no notices of pendency, stop orders, 
mechanics or materialmans liens or notices of intention to file same, or 
any other liens or encumbrances of any nature whatsoever on the Property 
which have not either been fully bonded to the satisfaction of Lender and 
discharged of record or in the alternative fully insured to the 
satisfaction of Lender by the title company issuing the Title Insurance 
Policy.

(iii) All plans and specifications required in connection with the 
Restoration shall be subject to prior review and acceptance in all respects 
by Lender and by an independent consulting engineer selected by Lender (the 
Casualty Consultant). Lender shall have the use of the plans and 
specifications and all permits, licenses and approvals required or obtained 
in connection with the Restoration. The identity of the contractors, 
subcontractors and materialmen engaged in the Restoration, as well as the 
contracts under which they have been engaged, shall be subject to prior 
review and reasonable acceptance by Lender and the Casualty Consultant. All 
reasonable costs and expenses incurred by Lender in connection with making 
the Net Proceeds available for the Restoration including, without 
limitation, reasonable counsel fees and disbursements and the Casualty 
Consultants fees, shall be paid by Borrower. Lender shall grant or deny 
with a reasonable explanation any consent required hereunder within 
fourteen (14) days after the receipt of the applicable request and all 
documents in connection therewith. In the event that Lender fails to 
respond within said fourteen (14) day period, such failure shall be deemed 
to be the consent and approval of Lender if (A) Borrower has delivered to 
Lender the applicable documents, with the notation IMMEDIATE RESPONSE 
REQUIRED, FAILURE TO RESPOND TO THIS APPROVAL REQUEST WITHIN FOURTEEN (14) 
DAYS FROM RECEIPT SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE LENDERS APPROVAL prominently 
displayed in bold, all caps and fourteen (14) point or larger font in the 
transmittal letter requesting approval and (B) Lender does not approve or 
reject (with a reasonable explanation) the applicable request within 
fourteen (14) days from the date Lender receives such request as evidenced 
by a certified mail return receipt or confirmation by a reputable national 
overnight delivery service that the same has been delivered to Borrower.

(iv) In no event shall Lender be obligated to make disbursements of the Net 
Proceeds in excess of an amount equal to the costs actually incurred from 
time to time for
 
-130-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
work in place as part of the Restoration, as certified by the Casualty 
Consultant, minus the Casualty Retainage. The term Casualty Retainage 
shall mean an amount equal to ten percent (10%) of the costs actually 
incurred for work in place as part of the Restoration, as certified by the 
Casualty Consultant, until the Restoration has been completed. The Casualty 
Retainage shall in no event, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary 
set forth above in this Section 6.4(b), be less than the amount actually 
held back by Borrower or Operating Lessee from contractors, subcontractors 
and materialmen engaged in the Restoration. The Casualty Retainage shall 
not be released until the Casualty Consultant certifies to Lender that the 
Restoration has been completed in accordance with the provisions of this 
Section 6.4(b) and that all approvals necessary for the re-occupancy and 
use of the Property have been obtained from all appropriate governmental 
and quasi-governmental authorities, and Lender receives evidence 
satisfactory to Lender that the costs of the Restoration have been paid in 
full or will be paid in full out of the Casualty Retainage; provided, 
however, that Lender will release the portion of the Casualty Retainage 
being held with respect to any contractor, subcontractor or materialman 
engaged in the Restoration as of the date upon which the Casualty 
Consultant certifies to Lender that the contractor, subcontractor or 
materialman has satisfactorily completed all work and has supplied all 
materials in accordance with the provisions of the contractors, 
subcontractors or materialmans contract, the contractor, subcontractor or 
materialman delivers the lien waivers and evidence of payment in full of 
all sums due to the contractor, subcontractor or materialman as may be 
reasonably requested by Lender or by the title company issuing the Title 
Insurance Policy, and Lender receives an endorsement to the Title Insurance 
Policy insuring the continued priority of the lien of the Mortgage and 
evidence of payment of any premium payable for such endorsement. If 
required by Lender, the release of any such portion of the Casualty 
Retainage shall be approved by the surety company, if any, which has issued 
a payment or performance bond with respect to the contractor, subcontractor 
or materialman.

(v) Lender shall not be obligated to make disbursements of the Net Proceeds 
more frequently than once every calendar month.

(vi) If at any time the Net Proceeds or the undisbursed balance thereof 
shall not, in the opinion of Lender in consultation with the Casualty 
Consultant, be sufficient to pay in full the balance of the costs which are 
estimated by the Casualty Consultant to be incurred in connection with the 
completion of the Restoration, Borrower or Operating Lessee shall (A) 
deposit the deficiency (the Net Proceeds Deficiency) with Lender or (B) 
deliver a Letter of Credit reasonably satisfactory to Lender in an amount 
equal to the Net Proceeds Deficiency before any further disbursement of the 
Net Proceeds shall be made. The Net Proceeds Deficiency deposited with 
Lender shall be held by Lender and shall be disbursed for costs actually 
incurred in connection with the Restoration on the same conditions 
applicable to the disbursement of the Net Proceeds, and until so disbursed 
pursuant to this Section 6.4(b) shall constitute additional security for 
the Debt and Other Obligations under the Loan Documents.

(vii) The excess, if any, of the Net Proceeds (and the remaining balance, 
if any, of the Net Proceeds Deficiency) deposited with Lender after the 
Casualty Consultant certifies to Lender that the Restoration has been 
completed in accordance with the
 
-131-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
provisions of this Section 6.4(b), and the receipt by Lender of evidence 
satisfactory to Lender that all costs incurred in connection with the 
Restoration have been paid in full, shall be remitted by Lender to 
Borrower, provided no Event of Default shall have occurred and shall be 
continuing under the Note, this Agreement or any of the other Loan 
Documents.

(c) Lender shall, with reasonable promptness following any Casualty or 
Condemnation, notify Borrower whether or not Net Proceeds are required to 
be made available to Borrower or Operating Lessee for a Restoration 
pursuant to this Section 6.4 (or, if the same are not required to be made 
available to Borrower or Operating Lessee for Restoration pursuant to this 
Section 6.4, whether Lender will nevertheless make the same available, 
which election Lender may make in its sole and absolute discretion). All 
Net Proceeds not required (i) to be made available for the Restoration or 
(ii) to be returned to Borrower as excess Net Proceeds pursuant to Section 
6.4(b)(vii) hereof may be retained and applied by Lender toward the payment 
of the Debt in accordance with Section 2.4.2 hereof, whether or not then 
due and payable in such order, priority and proportions as Lender in its 
sole discretion shall deem proper, or, at the discretion of Lender, the 
same may be paid, either in whole or in part, to Borrower for such purposes 
as Lender shall approve, in its discretion.

(d) In the event of foreclosure of the Mortgage or other transfer of title 
of the Property in extinguishment in whole or in part of the Debt all 
right, title and interest of Borrower or Operating Lessee in and to the 
Policies that are not blanket Policies then in force concerning the 
Property and all proceeds payable thereunder shall thereupon vest in the 
purchaser at such foreclosure or Lender or other transferee in the event of 
such other transfer of title.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Loan 
Documents (except Section 6.3(b) of this Agreement) with respect to the 
disbursement of Insurance Proceeds or Condemnation Proceeds in respect of 
the Ground Lease, the express provisions set forth in the Ground Lease 
shall govern; provided, however, to the extent the compliance by Borrower 
with the terms and conditions of this Section 6.4 do not create a default 
under the terms and provisions of the Ground Lease, Borrower shall comply 
with the terms and provisions of this Section 6.4 and, provided, further, 
that Borrower shall not grant its consent, approval or waiver with respect 
to any disbursement of Insurance Proceeds or Condemnation Proceeds in 
respect of the Ground Lease Property (if such disbursement would violate 
the terms and provisions of this Section 6.4) as may be requested or 
required in connection with the terms and provisions of the Ground Lease 
without first obtaining the written consent, approval, or waiver of Lender.

RESERVE FUNDS

Section 7.1 Intentionally Omitted.

Section 7.2 Tax and Insurance Escrow Funds.

(a) To the extent Taxes, Other Charges and/or Insurance Premiums are not 
reserved for in a Manager Account maintained by Manager pursuant to the 
Management Agreement or previously paid by Manager pursuant to the 
Management Agreement (provided, that to the extent so reserved or paid, 
Borrower delivers to Lender the invoices and other evidence of payment 
required under Section 5.1.2 and Section 6.1 hereof in which case the 
required deposit will be reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis by such 
amount), Borrower shall pay to Lender, on each Payment Date during a Cash 
Trap Period, (i) in any case in which Taxes and Other Charges are not so 
reserved or paid by the Manager, one twelfth (1/12) of the Taxes and Other 
Charges that Lender reasonably estimates will be payable during the next 
ensuing twelve (12) months in order to accumulate with Lender sufficient 
funds to pay all such Taxes and Other Charges at least thirty (30) days 
prior to the dates upon which such payments are required to be made and/or 
(ii) in any case in which Insurance Premiums are not so reserved or paid by 
the Manager, one twelfth (1/12) of the Insurance Premiums that Lender 
estimates will be payable for the renewal of the coverage afforded by the 
Policies upon the expiration thereof in order to accumulate with Lender 
sufficient funds to pay all such Insurance Premiums at least thirty (30) 
days prior to the expiration of the Policies (said amounts in clauses (i) 
and (ii) above hereinafter called the Tax and Insurance Escrow Funds). 
The account in which the Tax and Insurance Escrow Funds are held shall 
hereinafter be referred to as the Tax and Insurance Reserve Account. 
Lender will apply the Tax and Insurance Escrow Funds to payments of Taxes 
and Other Charges and Insurance Premiums required to be made by Borrower 
and/or Operating Lessee pursuant to Section 5.1.2 or Section 6.1 hereof (as 
applicable) and under the Mortgage. In making any payment relating to the 
Tax and Insurance Escrow Funds, Lender may do so according to any bill, 
statement or estimate procured from the appropriate public office (with 
respect to Taxes and Other Charges) or insurer or agent (with respect to 
Insurance Premiums), without inquiry into the accuracy of such bill, 
statement or estimate or into the validity of any tax, assessment, sale, 
forfeiture, tax lien or title or claim thereof. Provided that sufficient 
amounts are on deposit in the Tax and Insurance Escrow Account, Lender 
shall, upon Borrowers written request, reimburse Borrower or Operating 
Lessee (as applicable) from amounts on deposit in the Tax and Insurance 
Escrow Account for all real property Taxes, Other Charges and Insurance 
Premiums actually paid by Borrower or Operating Lessee. As a precondition 
to any such reimbursement, Borrower shall submit to Lender an Officers 
Certificate setting forth the amount of tax payments made and jurisdictions 
in which such payments were made (if applicable) and upon the written 
request of Lender receipts for payment or other evidence reasonably 
satisfactory to Lender that such real, property Taxes, Other Charges and 
Insurance Premiums have been paid. If the amount of the Tax and Insurance 
Escrow Funds shall exceed the amounts due for Taxes, Other Charges and 
Insurance Premiums pursuant to Section 5.1.2 hereof, Lender shall, in its 
sole discretion, return any excess to Borrower or credit such excess 
against future payments to be made to the Tax and Insurance Escrow Funds. 
If at any time Lender reasonably determines that the Tax and Insurance 
Escrow Funds are not or will
 
-133-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
not be sufficient to pay Taxes, Other Charges and Insurance Premiums by the 
dates set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) above, Lender shall provide written 
notice to Borrower of such determination and Borrower shall, commencing 
with the first Payment Date following Borrowers receipt of such written 
notice, increase its monthly payments to Lender by the amount that Lender 
estimates is sufficient to make up the deficiency at least thirty (30) days 
prior to the due date of the Taxes and Other Charges and/or thirty (30) 
days prior to expiration of the Policies, as the case may be. Any amounts 
remaining in the Tax and Insurance Escrow Account after the Debt has been 
paid in full or the Loan has been defeased shall be promptly returned to 
Borrower.

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, provided that no Event 
of Default has occurred and is continuing, to the extent that any of the 
insurance required to be maintained by Borrower or Operating Lessee under 
this Agreement and/or any other Loan Document is effected under a blanket 
policy reasonably acceptable to Lender insuring substantially all of the 
real property owned, directly or indirectly, by Guarantor, Borrower shall 
not be required to make deposits pursuant to the foregoing with respect to 
Insurance Premiums.

Section 7.3 Replacements and Replacement Reserve.

7.3.1 Replacement Reserve Funds. Borrower shall pay to Lender on each 
Payment Date an amount equal to the Replacement Reserve Monthly Deposit to 
fund the cost of Replacements; provided, however, that Replacements shall 
not include expense items that otherwise would be expensed in the operating 
statements of the Property pursuant to the Uniform System of Accounts and 
provided, further, that, for so long as Borrower and Operating Lessee 
maintain the Property in accordance with the Management Agreement, the 
Replacement Reserve Monthly Deposit shall be reduced on a dollar-for-dollar 
basis by any amounts either (x) deposited into the FF&E Account for the 
applicable calendar month as set forth in the Annual Budget and required 
pursuant to the terms of the Management Agreement if Borrower delivers 
evidence reasonably satisfactory to Lender that such deposit has been made 
or (y) otherwise accounted for pursuant to the Working Capital Peg Balance 
held in either Operating Account if Borrower delivers evidence reasonably 
satisfactory to Lender that the Working Capital Peg Balance sufficiently 
cover such amounts. Amounts so deposited shall hereinafter be referred to 
as the Replacement Reserve Funds and the account in which such amounts 
are held shall hereinafter be referred to as Borrowers Replacement 
Reserve Account.

7.3.2 Disbursements from Replacement Reserve Account. (a) Lender shall make 
disbursements from the Replacement Reserve Account to pay Borrower or 
Operating Lessee only for the costs of the Replacements upon satisfaction 
of the requirements set forth in this Section 7.3.2.

(b) Lender shall disburse to Borrower or Operating Lessee the Replacement 
Reserve Funds from the Replacement Reserve Account from time to time upon 
satisfaction by Borrower or Operating Lessee of each of the following 
conditions: (i) Borrower or Operating Lessee shall submit a written request 
for payment to Lender at least five (5) days prior to the date on which 
Borrower requests such payment be made and specifies the Replacements to be 
paid, (ii) on the date such payment is to be made, no Event of Default 
shall exist and remain uncured and (iii) Lender shall have received an 
Officers Certificate: (A) stating that, to Borrowers knowledge, all 
Replacements to be funded by the requested disbursement have been performed
 
-134-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
in good and workmanlike manner and in accordance with all applicable 
federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations, in all material 
respects, (B) identifying each Person that supplied materials or labor in 
connection with such Replacements to be funded by the requested 
disbursement, and (C) stating that each such Person has been paid or will 
be paid the amounts then due and payable to such Person in connection with 
the Replacements with the proceeds of such disbursement, such Officers 
Certificate to be accompanied by lien waivers or other evidence of payment 
satisfactory to Lender. Lender shall not be required to make disbursements 
from the Replacement Reserve Account with respect to the Property unless 
such requested disbursement is in an amount greater than Twenty-Five 
Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($25,000.00) (or a lesser amount if the total 
amount in the Replacement Reserve Account is less than $25,000.00), in 
which case only one disbursement of the amount remaining in the account 
shall be made) and such disbursement shall be made only upon satisfaction 
of each condition contained in this Section 7.3.2. Subject to Section 
7.3.2(c) below, in no event shall Lender be obligated to disburse funds to 
Borrower or Operating Lessee from the Replacement Reserve Account if an 
Event of Default exists.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, except during the continuance of an 
Event of Default, Lender shall make disbursements from the Replacement 
Reserve Account at the request of Manager upon receipt of a certificate (i) 
setting forth the amount of the requested disbursement, (ii) certifying 
that the requested disbursement will be used for the costs of FF&E as 
required by, and provided in the Management Agreement and (iii) certifying 
that the amounts being requested are in accordance with the budget provided 
under the Management Agreement, subject to variances permitted thereby.

7.3.3 Performance of Replacements. (a) Borrower or Operating Lessee shall 
make Replacements to the Property when required in order to keep the 
Property in good condition and repair and to keep the Property or any 
portion thereof from deteriorating consistent with the requirements of the 
Management Agreement. Borrower or Operating Lessee shall complete all 
Replacements to the Property in a good and workmanlike manner as soon as 
practicable following the commencement of making each such Replacement.

(b) During a Cash Trap Period, Lender reserves the right, at its option, to 
approve all contracts or work orders for amounts in excess of One Million 
and No/100 Dollars ($1,000,000.00) (such approval not to be unreasonably 
withheld, delayed or conditioned) with materialmen, mechanics, suppliers, 
subcontractors, contractors or other parties providing labor or materials 
in connection with the Replacements. Upon Lenders request, Borrower or 
Operating Lessee shall assign any contract or subcontract to Lender.

(c) During the continuance of an Event of Default, in the event Lender 
determines in its reasonable discretion that any Replacement is not being 
performed in a workmanlike or timely manner or that any Replacement has not 
been completed in a workmanlike or timely manner, upon three (3) Business 
Days written notice to Borrower, Lender shall have the option to withhold 
disbursement for such unsatisfactory Replacement and to proceed under 
existing contracts or to contract with third parties to complete such 
Replacement and to apply the Replacement Reserve Funds toward the labor and 
materials necessary to complete such Replacement and, without the 
requirement of providing any prior notice to Borrower, to exercise any and 
all other remedies available to Lender upon an Event of Default hereunder.
 
-135-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(d) During the continuance of an Event of Default, in order to facilitate 
Lenders completion or making of such Replacements pursuant to Section 
7.3.3(c) above, Borrower and Operating Lessee each grants Lender the right 
to enter onto the Property and perform any and all work and labor necessary 
to complete or make such Replacements and/or employ watchmen to protect the 
Property from damage (subject to the rights of Tenants and guests at the 
Property). All sums so expended by Lender, to the extent not from the 
Replacement Reserve Funds, shall be deemed to have been advanced under the 
Loan to Borrower and secured by the Mortgage. For this purpose each of 
Borrower and Operating Lessee constitutes and appoints Lender its true and 
lawful attorney in fact with full power of substitution to complete or 
undertake such Replacements in the name of Borrower or Operating Lessee. 
Such power of attorney shall be deemed to be a power coupled with an 
interest and cannot be revoked. Borrower and Operating Lessee each empowers 
said attorney in fact for this purpose as follows: (i) with respect to 
Borrowers grant of power only, to use any funds in the Replacement Reserve 
Account for the purpose of making or completing such Replacements; (ii) to 
make such additions, changes and corrections to such Replacements as shall 
be necessary or desirable to complete such Replacements; (iii) to employ 
such contractors, subcontractors, agents, architects and inspectors as 
shall be required for such purposes; (iv) to pay, settle or compromise all 
existing bills and claims which are or may become Liens against the 
Property, or as may be necessary or desirable for the completion of such 
Replacements, or for clearance of title; (v) to execute all applications 
and certificates in the name of Borrower or Operating Lessee which may be 
reasonably required by any of the contract documents; (vi) to prosecute and 
defend all actions or proceedings in connection with the Property or the 
rehabilitation and repair of the Property; and (vii) to do any and every 
reasonable act which Borrower or Operating Lessee might do in its own 
behalf to fulfill the terms of this Agreement.

(e) Nothing in this Section 7.3.3 shall: (i) make Lender responsible for 
making or completing any Replacements; (ii) require Lender to expend funds 
in addition to the Replacement Reserve Funds to make or complete any 
Replacement; (iii) obligate Lender to proceed with any Replacements; or 
(iv) obligate Lender to demand from Borrower or Operating Lessee additional 
sums to make or complete any Replacement.

(f) If reasonably determined to be necessary, Borrower and Operating Lessee 
shall permit Lender and Lenders agents and representatives (including, 
without limitation, Lenders engineer, architect, or inspector) or third 
parties making Replacements pursuant to this Section 7.3.3 to enter onto 
the Property during normal business hours (subject to the rights of Tenants 
under their Leases) to inspect the progress of any Replacements and all 
materials being used in connection therewith, to examine all plans and shop 
drawings relating to such Replacements which are or may be kept at the 
Property, and, during the continuance of an Event of Default, to complete 
any Replacements made pursuant to this Section 7.3.3. Borrower and 
Operating Lessee shall cause all contractors and subcontractors to 
cooperate with Lender or Lenders representatives or such other persons 
described above in connection with inspections described in this Section 
7.3.3(f) or the completion of Replacements pursuant to this Section 7.3.3 
with respect to the Property.
 
-136-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(g) During a Cash Trap Period, in connection with any single Replacement in 
excess of One Million and No/100 Dollars ($1,000,000.00), Lender may 
require an inspection of the Property at Borrowers expense prior to making 
a monthly disbursement from the Replacement Reserve Account in order to 
verify completion of the Replacements for which reimbursement is sought (or 
portion thereof in the case of periodic payments). Lender may require that 
such inspection be conducted by an appropriate independent qualified 
professional selected by Lender and reasonably approved by Borrower and/or 
may require a copy of a certificate of completion by an independent 
qualified professional reasonably acceptable to Lender prior to the 
disbursement of any amounts from the Replacement Reserve Account. Borrower 
shall pay the actual out-of-pocket expense of the inspection as required 
hereunder, whether such inspection is conducted by Lender or by an 
independent qualified professional.

(h) The Replacements and all materials, equipment, fixtures, or any other 
item comprising a part of any Replacement shall be constructed, installed

Section 7.10 Reserve Funds, Generally. Each of Borrower and/or Operating 
Lessee (as applicable) grants to Lender a first priority perfected security 
interest in each of the Reserve Accounts and any and all monies now or 
hereafter deposited in each Reserve Account as additional security for 
payment of the Debt. Until expended or applied in accordance herewith, the 
Reserve Funds shall constitute additional security for the Debt. Subject to 
Priority Waterfall Payments and payments made to Manager or any R&A 
Sub-Manager pursuant to Section 7.3.2(c) hereof, upon the occurrence and 
during the continuance of an Event of Default, Lender may, in addition to 
any and all other rights and remedies available to Lender, apply any sums 
then present in any or all of the Reserve Accounts to the payment of the 
Debt in any order in its sole discretion. The Reserve Funds shall not 
constitute trust funds and may be commingled with other monies held by 
Lender. The Reserve Funds shall be held in an Eligible Account in Permitted 
Investments in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Cash 
Management Agreement. All interest or other earnings on the Reserve Funds 
shall be added to and become a part of such Reserve Funds and shall be 
disbursed or applied, as applicable, in the same manner as other monies 
deposited in the related Reserve Account. Borrower shall be responsible for 
payment of any federal, state or local income or other tax applicable to 
the interest earned on the Reserve Funds credited or paid to Borrower. 
Neither Borrower nor Operating Lessee shall, without obtaining the prior 
written consent of Lender, further pledge, assign or grant any security 
interest in any Reserve Account or the monies deposited therein or permit 
any lien or encumbrance to attach thereto, or any levy to be made thereon, 
or any UCC-1 Financing Statements, except those naming Lender as the 
secured party, to be filed with respect thereto.
 
-139-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lender shall not be liable for any loss sustained on the investment of any 
funds constituting the Reserve Funds, provided such Reserve Funds are held 
in an Eligible Account in Permitted Investments in accordance with the 
terms and provisions of the Cash Management Agreement. Borrower shall 
indemnify Lender and hold Lender harmless from and against any and all 
actions, suits, claims, demands, liabilities, losses, damages, obligations 
and costs and expenses (including litigation costs and reasonable 
attorneys fees and expenses) arising from or in any way connected with the 
Reserve Accounts or the performance of the obligations for which the 
Reserve Accounts were established. Each of Borrower and Operating Lessee 
shall assign to Lender all rights and claims that it may have against all 
persons or entities supplying labor, materials or other services which are 
to be paid from or secured by the applicable Reserve Funds; provided, 
however, that Lender may not pursue any such right or claim unless an Event 
of Default has occurred and remains uncured. Any amount remaining in the 
Reserve Accounts after the Debt has been paid in full or the Loan has been 
defeased shall be returned to Borrower.

Management Agreement) or Replacement R&A Management Agreement, or the term 
of the Management Agreement (or any Replacement Management Agreement) or 
any Replacement R&A Management Agreement expires and in each case, unless

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(b) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default 
(other than an Event of Default described in clauses (vi), (vii) or (viii) 
above) and at any time thereafter, in addition to any other rights or 
remedies available to it pursuant to this Agreement and the other Loan 
Documents or at law or in equity, Lender may take such action, without 
notice or demand, that Lender deems advisable to protect and enforce its 
rights against Borrower or Operating Lessee and in and to the Property or 
any portion thereof, including, without limitation, declaring the Debt to 
be immediately due and payable, and Lender may enforce or avail itself of 
any or all rights or remedies provided in the Loan Documents against 
Borrower and any or all of portions of the Property, including, without 
limitation, all rights or remedies available at law or in equity; and upon 
any Event of Default described in clauses (vi), (vii) or (viii) above, the 
Debt and Other Obligations of Borrower or Operating Lessee hereunder and 
under the other Loan Documents shall immediately and automatically become 
due and payable, without notice or demand, and Borrower and Operating 
Lessee hereby expressly waive any such notice or demand, anything contained 
herein or in any other Loan Document to the contrary notwithstanding.

Section 8.2 Remedies. (a) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of 
an Event of Default, all or any one or more of the rights, powers, 
privileges and other remedies available to Lender against Borrower or 
Operating Lessee under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents 
executed and delivered by, or applicable to, Borrower or Operating Lessee 
or at law or in equity may be exercised by Lender at any time and from time 
to time, whether or not all or any of the Debt shall be declared due and 
payable, and whether or not Lender shall have commenced any foreclosure 
proceeding or other action for the enforcement of its rights and remedies 
under any of the Loan Documents with respect to the Property or any portion 
thereof. Any such actions taken by Lender shall be cumulative and 
concurrent and may be pursued independently, singularly, successively, 
together or otherwise, at such time and in such order as Lender may 
determine in its sole discretion, to the fullest extent permitted by law, 
without impairing or otherwise affecting the other rights and remedies of 
Lender permitted by law, equity or contract or as set forth herein or in 
the other Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, 
Borrower and Operating Lessee agree that if an Event of Default is 
continuing (i) Lender is not subject to any one action or election of 
remedies law or rule, and (ii) all liens and other rights, remedies or 
privileges provided to Lender shall remain in full force and effect until 
Lender has exhausted all of its remedies against the Property and the 
Mortgage has been foreclosed, sold and/or otherwise realized upon in 
satisfaction of the Debt or the Debt has been paid in full, including 
without limitation, any liquidation fees, workout fees, special servicing 
fees and interest payable on advances made by the Servicer with respect to 
delinquent debt service payments or expenses of curing Borrowers or 
Operating Lessees defaults under the Loan Documents or other similar fees 
payable to Servicer or any special servicer in connection therewith.

(b) With respect to Borrower, Operating Lessee and the Property, nothing 
contained herein or in any other Loan Document shall be construed as 
requiring Lender to resort to any portion of the Property for the 
satisfaction of any of the Debt in any preference or priority to any other 
portion thereof, and Lender may seek satisfaction out of all or any 
portions of the Property, in its absolute discretion in respect of the 
Debt. In addition, to the extent permitted by applicable law, Lender shall 
have the right from time to time to partially foreclose the Mortgage in any 
manner and for any amounts secured by the Mortgage then due and payable as 
determined
 
-143-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
by Lender in its sole discretion including, without limitation, the 
following circumstances: (i) in the event an Event of Default occurs in 
respect of the payment of one or more scheduled payments of interest, 
Lender may foreclose the Mortgage to recover such delinquent payments or 
(ii) in the event Lender elects to accelerate less than the entire 
outstanding principal balance of the Loan, Lender may partially foreclose 
the Mortgage to recover so much of the principal balance of the Loan as 
Lender may accelerate and such other sums secured by the Mortgage as Lender 
may elect. Notwithstanding one or more such partial foreclosures, the 
Property shall remain subject to the Mortgage to secure payment of sums 
secured by the Mortgage and not previously recovered.

(c) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, 
Lender shall have the right from time to time to sever the Note and the 
other Loan Documents into one or more separate notes, mortgages and other 
security documents in a manner consistent with Section 9.1.2 hereof (the 
Severed Loan Documents) in such denominations as Lender shall determine in 
its sole discretion for purposes of evidencing and enforcing its rights and 
remedies provided hereunder. Borrower and Operating Lessee shall execute 
and deliver to Lender from time to time, promptly after the request of 
Lender, a severance agreement and such other documents as Lender shall 
request in order to effect the severance described in the preceding 
sentence, all in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Lender. 
Borrower and Operating Lessee hereby absolutely and irrevocably appoint 
Lender as its respective true and lawful attorney, coupled with an 
interest, in its name and stead to make and execute all documents necessary 
or desirable to effect the aforesaid severance, Borrower and Operating 
Lessee ratifying all that its said attorney shall do by virtue thereof; 
provided, however, Lender shall not make or execute any such documents 
under such power until three (3) days after written notice has been given 
to Borrower or Operating Lessee by Lender of Lenders intent to exercise 
its rights under such power. Borrower shall be obligated to pay any costs 
or expenses incurred in connection with the preparation, execution, 
recording or filing of the Severed Loan Documents and the Severed Loan 
Documents shall not contain any representations, warranties or covenants 
not contained in the Loan Documents and any such representations and 
warranties contained in the Severed Loan Documents will be given by 
Borrower and Operating Lessee only as of the Closing Date.

(d) As used in this Section 8.2, a foreclosure shall include, without 
limitation, any sale by power of sale.

Section 8.3 Remedies Cumulative; Waivers. The rights, powers and remedies 
of Lender under this Agreement shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any 
other right, power or remedy which Lender may have against Borrower or 
Operating Lessee pursuant to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, or 
existing at law or in equity or otherwise. Lenders rights, powers and 
remedies may be pursued singularly, concurrently or otherwise, at such time 
and in such order as Lender may determine in Lenders sole discretion. No 
delay or omission to exercise any remedy, right or power accruing upon an 
Event of Default shall impair any such remedy, right or power or shall be 
construed as a waiver thereof, but any such remedy, right or power may be 
exercised from time to time and as often as may be deemed expedient. A 
waiver of one Default or Event of Default with respect to Borrower or 
Operating Lessee shall not be construed to be a waiver of any subsequent 
Default or Event of Default by Borrower or Operating Lessee or to impair 
any remedy, right or power consequent thereon.

circumstances upon which such representation and warranty is based are 
specific solely to a certain date in which case confirmation as to truth, 
completeness and correctness shall be provided as of such specific date or

the Loan Documents in any material respect or (z) any other obligation or 
liability of Guarantor in any respect, (ii) shall not change the weighted

as Lender shall reasonably determine to be required pursuant to Regulation 
AB under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), or 
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), or 
any amendment, modification or replacement thereto or other legal 
requirements in connection with any Disclosure Documents or any filing 
pursuant to the Exchange Act in connection with the Securitization or as 
shall otherwise be reasonably requested by Lender, so long as providing 
such statements or information would not cause Borrower or any of its 
Affiliates to be in violation of applicable securities laws.

9.1.2 Loan Components. (a) Borrower covenants and agrees that prior to a 
Securitization of the Loan, upon Lenders request Borrower shall (i) 
deliver one or more new notes to replace the original note or modify the 
original note and other loan documents, as reasonably required, to reflect 
additional components of the Loan or allocate interest rate or principal 
among any new components in Lenders sole discretion, provided, (1) such 
new or modified note shall at all times have the same weighted average 
interest rate of the original Note (except following an Event of Default or 
any prepayment of the Loan pursuant to Section 2.4.2
 
-146-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
hereof or to the extent that the application of a prepayment to the Loan 
pursuant to Section 2.4.4 results in rate creep), (2) no amortization of 
principal of the Loan will be required and (3) there shall be no 
modification to any Loan Document other than as necessary to reflect the 
additional components of the Loan or allocation of interest rate to such 
new components, as applicable (including, without limitation, any change in 
the outstanding principal amount of the Loan or the Maturity Date, any 
decrease in any time period in which Borrower or Operating Lessee is 
permitted to perform its applicable obligations under the Loan Documents or 
any change in any prepayment premium that would not otherwise have been due 
as of the Closing Date based upon the definition of Yield Maintenance 
Premium), and (ii) modify the Cash Management Agreement to reflect such new 
components; and further provided, that none of the foregoing actions shall 
have a material adverse effect on Borrower or Operating Lessee or affect 
any rights or obligations of Borrower or Operating Lessee under the Loan 
Documents in any materially adverse respect.

(b) Intentionally Omitted.

(c) Borrower shall execute and deliver such documents as shall reasonably 
be required by Lender in connection with this Section 9.1.2, all in form 
and substance reasonably satisfactory to Lender and the Rating Agencies 
within ten (10) days following a written request by Lender. It shall be an 
Event of Default if Borrower fails to promptly comply in all material 
respects with the terms, covenants or conditions of this Section 9.1.2. 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Lender shall cause all 
reasonable costs and expenses incurred by Borrower in connection with this 
Section 9.1.2 (including, without limitation, any documentary stamp taxes, 
intangible taxes and other recording taxes) to be paid by Lender.

(d) Notwithstanding any action taken by Lender pursuant to this Section 
9.1.2, Borrower and/or Operating Lessee shall, at all times, be required to 
send notice and obtain consents from a single agent of Lender or master 
servicer with respect to the Loan.

9.1.3 Intentionally omitted.

9.1.4 Securitization Costs. All reasonable third party out-of-pocket costs 
and expenses incurred by Borrower and Guarantor in connection with 
Borrowers complying with requests made under Section 9.1 (including, 
without limitation, the fees and expenses of the Rating Agencies) shall be 
paid by Lender. All of Lenders costs and expenses, including Lenders 
legal fees, incurred in connection with a Securitization shall be paid by 
Lender.

Section 9.2 Securitization Indemnification. (a) Borrower understands that 
certain of the Provided Information may be included in Disclosure Documents 
in connection with the Securitization and may also be included in filings 
with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Securities Act, 
or Exchange Act or provided or made available to investors or prospective 
investors in the Securities, the Rating Agencies, and service providers 
relating to the Securitization. In the event that the Disclosure Document 
is required to be revised prior to the sale of all Securities, Borrower 
will cooperate with the holder of the Note in updating the Covered 
Disclosure Information by providing all current information necessary to 
keep the Covered Disclosure Information accurate and complete in all 
material respects.
 
-147-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(b) The Indemnifying Persons agree to provide, in connection with the 
Securitization, an indemnification agreement (A) certifying that (i) the 
Indemnifying Persons have, at Lenders request in connection with each 
Securitization, reviewed the sections of the Disclosure Documents entitled 
Risk Factors (solely to the extent the Risk Factors relate to Borrower, 
Guarantor, Operating Lessee, the Management Agreement and the Property), 
Special Considerations, Description of the Mortgage, Description of 
the Mortgage Loan and Mortgaged Property, Description of the Borrower, 
The Ground Lease, Description of Operating Lessee, Description of 
Operating Lease, Description of the Property Manager, Management 
Agreement and Subordination, Non-Disturbance and Attornment Agreements, 
The Manager, The Operating Lessee and The Borrower and Annex E  
Representations and Warranties of the Borrower (collectively with the 
Provided Information, the Covered Disclosure Information), in each case, 
solely to the extent relating to the collateral for the Loan, Borrower, 
Operating Lessee, Guarantor or a Manager, and (ii) the Covered Disclosure 
Information does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or 
omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements 
made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not 
misleading, (B) jointly and severally indemnifying the Indemnified Persons 
for any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs or expenses (including 
without limitation reasonable legal fees and expenses for enforcement of 
these obligations (collectively, the Liabilities) to which any such 
Indemnified Person may become subject insofar as the Liabilities arise out 
of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of 
any material fact contained in the Covered Disclosure Information or arise 
out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state in the 
Covered Disclosure Information a material fact required to be stated 
therein or necessary in order to make the statements in the Covered 
Disclosure Information, in light of the circumstances under which they were 
made, not misleading and (C) agreeing to reimburse each Indemnified Person 
for any legal or other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person, as 
they are incurred, in connection with investigating or defending the 
Liabilities. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability 
which Borrower may otherwise have. Moreover, the indemnification and 
reimbursement obligations provided for in clauses (B) and (C) above shall 
be effective, valid and binding obligations of Indemnifying Persons, 
whether or not an indemnification agreement described in clause (A) above 
is provided.

(c) In connection with Exchange Act Filings, the Indemnifying Persons 
jointly and severally agree to indemnify (i) the Indemnified Persons for 
Liabilities to which any such Indemnified Person may become subject insofar 
as the Liabilities arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or 
alleged untrue statement of any material fact in the Covered Disclosure 
Information, or the omission or alleged omission to state in the Covered 
Disclosure Information a material fact required to be stated therein or 
necessary in order to make the statements in the Covered Disclosure 
Information, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not 
misleading and (ii) reimburse each Indemnified Person for any legal or 
other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Persons, as they are incurred, 
in connection with defending or investigating the Liabilities.

(d) Promptly after receipt by an Indemnified Person of notice of any claim 
or the commencement of any action, the Indemnified Person shall, if a claim 
in respect thereof is to be made against any Indemnifying Person, notify 
such Indemnifying Person in writing of the claim or the commencement of 
that action; provided, however, that the failure to notify such
 
-148-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability which it may 
have under the indemnification provisions of this Section 9.2 except to the 
extent that it has been materially prejudiced by such failure and, 
provided, further, that the failure to notify such Indemnifying Person 
shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to an Indemnified 
Person otherwise than under the provisions of this Section 9.2. If any such 
claim or action shall be brought against an Indemnified Person, and it 
shall notify any Indemnifying Person thereof, such Indemnifying Person 
shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it wishes, 
assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the 
Indemnified Person. After notice from any Indemnifying Person to the 
Indemnified Person of its election to assume the defense of such claim or 
action, such Indemnifying Person shall not be liable to the Indemnified 
Person for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the 
Indemnified Person in connection with the defense thereof except as 
provided in the following sentence; provided, however, if the defendants in 
any such action include both an Indemnifying Person, on the one hand, and 
one or more Indemnified Persons on the other hand, and an Indemnified 
Person shall have reasonably concluded that there are any legal defenses 
available to it and/or other Indemnified Persons that are different or in 
addition to those available to the Indemnifying Person, the Indemnified 
Person or Persons shall have the right to select separate counsel to assert 
such legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such 
action on behalf of such Indemnified Person or Persons. The Indemnified 
Person shall instruct its counsel to maintain reasonably detailed billing 
records for fees and disbursements for which such Indemnified Person is 
seeking reimbursement hereunder and shall submit copies of such detailed 
billing records to substantiate that such counsels fees and disbursements 
are solely related to the defense of a claim for which the Indemnifying 
Person is required hereunder to indemnify such Indemnified Person. No 
Indemnifying Person shall be liable for the expenses of more than one (1) 
such separate counsel unless such Indemnified Person shall have reasonably 
concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it that are 
different from or additional to those available to another Indemnified 
Person.

(e) Without the prior written consent of Lender or its designee (which 
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), no Indemnifying 
Person shall settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment 
in any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect 
of which indemnification may be sought hereunder (whether or not any 
Indemnified Person is an actual or potential party to such claim, action, 
suit or proceeding) unless the Indemnifying Person shall have given Lender 
or its designee reasonable prior written notice thereof and shall have 
obtained an unconditional release of each Indemnified Person hereunder from 
all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceedings. As 
long as an Indemnifying Person has complied with its obligations to defend 
and indemnify hereunder, such Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for 
any settlement made by any Indemnified Person without the consent of such 
Indemnifying Person (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or 
delayed).

(f) The Indemnifying Persons agree that if any indemnification or 
reimbursement sought pursuant to this Section 9.2 is finally judicially 
determined to be unavailable for any reason or is insufficient to hold any 
Indemnified Person harmless (with respect only to the Liabilities that are 
the subject of this Section 9.2), then the Indemnifying Persons, on the one 
hand, and such Indemnified Person, on the other hand, shall contribute to 
the Liabilities for which such indemnification or reimbursement is held 
unavailable or is insufficient:
 
-149-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(x) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits 
to the Indemnifying Persons, on the one hand, and such Indemnified Person, 
on the other hand, from the transactions to which such indemnification or 
reimbursement relates; or (y) if the allocation provided by clause (x) 
above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is 
appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in 
clause (x) but also the relative faults of the Indemnifying Persons, on the 
one hand, and all Indemnified Persons, on the other hand, as well as any 
other equitable considerations. Notwithstanding the provisions of this 
Section 9.2, (A) no party found liable for a fraudulent misrepresentation 
shall be entitled to contribution from any other party who is not also 
found liable for such fraudulent misrepresentation, and (B) the 
Indemnifying Persons agree that in no event shall the amount to be 
contributed by the Indemnified Persons collectively pursuant to this 
paragraph exceed the amount of the fees actually received by the 
Indemnified Persons in connection with the closing of the Loan and 
Securitization.

(g) The Indemnifying Persons agree that the indemnification, contribution 
and reimbursement obligations set forth in this Section 9.2 shall apply 
whether or not any Indemnified Person is a formal party to any lawsuits, 
claims or other proceedings. The Indemnifying Persons further agree that 
the Indemnified Persons are intended third party beneficiaries under this 
Section 9.2.

(h) The liabilities and obligations of the Indemnified Persons and the 
Indemnifying Persons under this Section 9.2 shall survive the termination 
of this Agreement and the satisfaction and discharge of the Debt.

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Borrower 
shall have no obligation to act as depositor with respect to the Loan or an 
issuer or registrant with respect to the Securities issued in any 
Securitization.

Section 9.3 Exculpation. (a) Subject to the qualifications set forth in 
this Section 9.3, Lender shall not enforce the liability and obligation of 
Borrower or Operating Lessee to perform and observe its respective 
obligations contained in the Note (as to Borrower), this Agreement or any 
other Loan Document to which it is a party by any action or proceeding 
wherein a money judgment shall be sought against Borrower or Operating 
Lessee, except that Lender may bring a foreclosure action, an action for 
specific performance or any other appropriate action or proceeding to 
enable Lender to enforce and realize upon its interest under the Note, this 
Agreement, the Mortgage and the other Loan Documents, or in the Property, 
the Rents, or any other collateral given to Lender pursuant to the Loan 
Documents; provided, however, that, except as specifically provided herein, 
any judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be enforceable against 
Borrower or Operating Lessee only to the extent of Borrowers or Operating 
Lessees interest in the Property, in the Rents and in any other collateral 
given to Lender, and Lender, by accepting the Note, this Agreement, the 
Mortgage and the other Loan Documents, agrees that it shall not sue for, 
seek or demand any deficiency judgment against Borrower or Operating Lessee 
in any such action or proceeding under or by reason of or under or in 
connection with the Note, this Agreement, the Mortgage or the other Loan 
Documents. The provisions of this Section shall not, however, (i) 
constitute a waiver, release or impairment of any obligation evidenced or 
secured by any of the Loan Documents; (ii) impair the right of Lender to 
name Borrower or Operating Lessee as a party defendant in any action or
 
-150-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
suit for foreclosure and sale under the Mortgage; (iii) affect the validity 
or enforceability of or any guaranty made in connection with the Loan or 
any of the rights and remedies of Lender thereunder; (iv) impair the right 
of Lender to obtain the appointment of a receiver; (v) impair the 
enforcement of any assignment of leases contained in the Mortgage; or (vi) 
constitute a prohibition against Lender to seek a deficiency judgment 
against Borrower in order to fully realize the security granted by the 
Mortgage or to commence any other appropriate action or proceeding in order 
for Lender to exercise its remedies against the Property.

(b) Nothing contained herein shall in any manner or way release, affect or 
impair the right of Lender to enforce the liability and obligation of 
Borrower or Operating Lessee, by money judgment or otherwise, to the extent 
of any loss, damage, cost, expense, liability, claim or other obligation to 
the extent actually incurred by Lender (including reasonable attorneys 
fees and costs reasonably incurred) arising out of or incurred in 
connection with the following actions or omissions on the part of 
Guarantor, Borrower, Operating Lessee, any Affiliated Manager or any 
Affiliate of Guarantor, Borrower, Operating Lessee or any Affiliated 
Manager:

(i) fraud or material and willful misrepresentation by Borrower, Principal, 
Guarantor, Affiliated Manager, Operating Lessee or any Affiliate of 
Borrower, Principal, Guarantor, Operating Lessee or any Affiliated Manager 
in connection with the Loan;

(ii) willful misconduct by Borrower, Principal, Operating Lessee, 
Guarantor, Affiliated Manager or any Affiliate of Borrower, Principal, 
Operating Lessee, Guarantor or any Affiliated Manager that results in 
physical damage or waste to any Property;

(iii) the removal or disposal by, or on behalf, of Borrower, Operating 
Lessee, Principal, Guarantor, Affiliated Manager or any Affiliate of 
Borrower, Operating Lessee, Principal, Guarantor or any Affiliated Manager, 
of any portion of any Property during the continuance of an Event of 
Default;

(iv) the misappropriation or conversion by Borrower, Operating Lessee, 
Principal, Guarantor, Affiliated Manager or any Affiliate of Borrower,

Insurance Proceeds paid by reason of a Casualty, (B) any Awards received in 
connection with a Condemnation of all or a portion of the Property, (C) any 
Rents during the continuance of an Event of Default, or (D) any Rents paid 
more than one month in advance;

(v) a material breach of any covenant set forth in Section 5.1.28(a), (b) 
or (c) hereof;

(vi) if Borrower fails to obtain Lenders prior written consent to any 
financing or other voluntary Lien encumbering the Property, if such consent 
is required in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Loan 
Documents;

(vii) if Borrower or Operating Lessee fails to obtain Lenders prior 
written consent to any Transfer of the Property or a Transfer of the 
ownership interests in Borrower or Operating Lessee, in each case, as 
required by Section 5.2.10 hereof, and in each case, excluding Permitted 
Transfers; or
 
-151-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(viii) the occurrence of an ERISA Event.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Note or 
any of the Loan Documents, (i) Lender shall not be deemed to have waived 
any right which Lender may have under Section 506(a), 506(b), 1111(b) or 
any other provisions of the Bankruptcy Code to file a claim for the full 
amount of the Debt secured by the Mortgage or to require that all 
collateral shall continue to secure all of the Debt owing to Lender in 
accordance with the Loan Documents, and (ii) the Debt shall be fully 
recourse to Borrower in the event of: (A) Borrower, Operating Lessee or 
Principal filing a voluntary petition under the Bankruptcy Code or any 
other Federal or state bankruptcy or insolvency law; (B) the filing of an 
involuntary petition by any Person (other than Lender) against Borrower, 
Operating Lessee or Principal under the Bankruptcy Code or any other 
Federal or state bankruptcy or insolvency law in which Borrower, Operating 
Lessee, Principal or Guarantor or any Affiliate of Borrower, Operating 
Lessee, Principal or Guarantor colludes with, or otherwise assists, such 
Person, or solicits or causes to be solicited petitioning creditors for any 
involuntary petition against Borrower, Operating Lessee or Principal, by 
any Person (other than Lender); (C) Borrower, Operating Lessee, Principal 
or Guarantor or any Affiliate of Borrower, Operating Lessee, Principal or 
Guarantor filing an answer consenting to or otherwise acquiescing in or 
joining in any involuntary petition filed against Borrower, Operating 
Lessee or Principal, by any other Person (other than Lender) under the 
Bankruptcy Code or any other Federal or state bankruptcy or insolvency law 
or (D) Borrower, Operating Lessee or Principal, consenting to or 
acquiescing in or joining in an application for the appointment of a 
custodian, receiver, trustee, or examiner for Borrower, Operating Lessee, 
Principal, or any portion of the Property.

Section 9.4 Matters Concerning Manager. If an Event of Default has occurred 
and remains uncured and either (a) Manager or any R&A Manager becomes 
subject to a Bankruptcy Action or (b) Manager is in default under the 
Management Agreement or any R&A Manager is in default under the R&A 
Management Agreement or a Replacement R&A Management Agreement (as 
applicable), in either case, beyond any applicable grace or cure period, 
Borrower or Operating Lessee (as applicable) shall, in each case, at the 
request of Lender, exercise its contractual rights under the Management 
Agreement, the R&A Management Agreement or a Replacement R&A Management 
Agreement (as applicable) to terminate the same and replace Manager or the 
R&A Manager (as applicable) with a Qualified Manager pursuant to a 
Replacement Management Agreement or with a Qualified R&A Manager pursuant 
to a Replacement R&A Management Agreement (as applicable), it being 
understood and agreed that the management fee for such Qualified Manager or 
Qualified R&A Manager (as applicable) shall not exceed then prevailing 
market rates.

Section 9.5 Servicer. At the option of Lender, the Loan may be serviced by 
a master servicer, primary servicer, special servicer and/or trustee (any 
such master servicer, primary servicer, special servicer, and trustee, 
together with its agents, nominees or designees, are collectively referred 
to as servicer (Servicer) selected by Lender and Lender may delegate all 
or any portion of its responsibilities under this Agreement and the other 
Loan Documents to Servicer pursuant to a pooling and servicing agreement, 
special servicing agreement or other agreement providing for the servicing 
of one or more mortgage loans (collectively, the Servicing Agreement) 
between Lender and Servicer. Lender shall be responsible for any reasonable 
set-up fees or any other initial costs relating to or arising under the 
Servicing
 
-152-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Agreement and Borrower shall not be responsible for payment of the regular 
monthly master servicing fee or trustee fee due to Servicer or the trustee 
under the Servicing Agreement or any fees or expenses required to be borne 
by Servicer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Borrower shall promptly 
reimburse Lender on demand for the following: all actual out-of-pocket 
reasonable costs and expenses, liquidation fees, workout fees, special 
servicing fees, operating advisor fees, certificate administrator fees or 
any other similar fees and to the extent charges pursuant to Section 2.3.4 
hereof and interest at the Default Rate actually paid by Borrower is 
insufficient to pay for same, interest payable on advances made by the 
Servicer or the trustee with respect to (a) delinquent Debt Service 
payments or expenses of curing any default by Borrower, Operating Lessee or 
Guarantor under the Loan Documents, payable by Lender to Servicer or a 
trustee and provided for under the Servicing Agreement or actual 
out-of-pocket reasonable expenses paid by Servicer or a trustee in respect

provided under this Agreement in the nature of a work-out of the Loan 
Documents or of any insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding of Borrower, 
Operating Lessee or Guarantor or (c) the costs of all property inspections 
and/or appraisals of the Property (or any updates to any existing 
inspection or appraisal) that Servicer may be required to obtain (other 
than the cost of regular annual inspections required to be borne by 
Servicer under the Servicing Agreement). Additionally, Borrower shall pay 
the customary and reasonable servicing fees in connection with any special 
requests made by Borrower, Operating Lessee or Guarantor during the term of 
the Loan including, without limitation, in connection with a prepayment, 
assumption or modification of the Loan. Lender (or a Servicer on Lenders 
behalf) shall grant or deny with a reasonable explanation any consent 
required hereunder within a ten (10) day period (or such shorter period as 
provided in this Agreement) after the receipt of the applicable request and 
all documents in connection therewith. In the event that Lender (or a 
Servicer on Lenders behalf) fails to respond within said ten (10) day 
period (or such shorter period as provided in this Agreement), such failure 
shall be deemed to be the consent and approval of Lender (or a Servicer on 
Lenders behalf) if, after the expiration of said ten (10) day period (A) 
Borrower has resubmitted to Lender (or a Servicer on Lenders behalf) the 
applicable documents, with the notation IMMEDIATE RESPONSE REQUIRED, 
FAILURE TO RESPOND TO THIS APPROVAL REQUEST WITHIN FIVE (5) DAYS (OR SUCH 
SHORTER PERIOD AS REQUIRED BY THIS AGREEMENT) FROM RECEIPT SHALL BE DEEMED 
TO BE LENDERS APPROVAL prominently displayed in bold, all caps and 
fourteen (14) point or larger font in the transmittal letter requesting 
approval and (B) Lender (or a Servicer on Lenders behalf) does not approve 
or reject (with a reasonable explanation) the applicable request within 
such five (5) day period (or such shorter period as provided in this 
Agreement) from the date Lender (or a Servicer on Lenders behalf) receives 
such request as evidenced by a certified mail return receipt or 
confirmation by a reputable national overnight delivery service that the 
same has been delivered. Lender hereby agrees to endeavor to appoint 
Midland Loan Services as the initial master servicer of the Loan.

Section 9.6 Intentionally Omitted.
 
-153-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Section 9.7 Register. (a) The Servicer, or if no Servicer has been engaged, 
Lender, as non-fiduciary agent of Borrower, shall maintain a record that 
identifies each owner (including successors and assignees) of an interest 
in the Loan, including the name and address of the owner, and each owners 
rights to principal and stated interest (the Register), and shall record 
all transfers of an interest in the Loan, including each assignment, in the 
Register. Transfers of interests in the Loan (including assignments) shall 
be subject to the applicable conditions set forth in the Loan Documents 
with respect thereto and Servicer will update the Register to reflect the 
transfer. Furthermore, each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting 
solely for this purpose as agent of Borrower, maintain a register on which 
it enters the name and address of each participant and the principal 
amounts and stated interest of each participants interest (the 
Participant Register); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation 
to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register to any Person 
(including the identity of any participant or any information relating to a 
participants interest) except to the extent that such disclosure is 
necessary to establish that such obligation is in registered form under 
Section 5f.103-1(c) of the U.S. Department of Treasury regulations. The 
entries in the Register and Participant Register shall be conclusive absent 
manifest error. Borrower, the Lenders and the Servicer shall treat each 
Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof 
as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, and Borrower, the 
Lenders and the Servicer shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in 
the Participant Register pursuant to the terms hereof as the owner of such 
participation for all purposes of this Agreement. Failure to make any such 
recordation, or any error in such recordation, however, shall not affect 
Borrowers obligations in respect of the Loan. Borrower and Lender 
acknowledge that the Notes are in registered form and may not be 
transferred except by register.

(b) Borrower agrees that each participant pursuant to Section 9.1.1(a) 
shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.7 (subject to the 
requirements and limitations therein, including the requirements under 
Section 2.7(e) (it being understood that the documentation required under 
Section 2.7(e) shall be delivered to the participating Lender)) to the same 
extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment; 
provided that such participant (A) agrees to be subject to the provisions 
of Section 2.7(h) as if it were an assignee hereunder; and (B) shall not be 
entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.7, with respect to 
any participation, than its participating Lender would have been entitled 
to receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater 
payment results from a change in a requirement of law or in the 
interpretation or application thereof, or compliance by such participant or 
the participating Lender with any request or directive (whether or not 
having the force of law) issued from any central bank or other Governmental 
Authority, in each case after the participant acquired the applicable 
participation.

right to apply or reverse and reapply any and all payments by Borrower to

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(b) Borrower shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Indemnified 
Parties from and against any and all other liabilities, obligations, 
losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, claims, costs, 
expenses and disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever (including,

connection with any investigative, administrative or judicial proceeding 
commenced or threatened, whether or not an Indemnified Party shall be 
designated a party thereto), that may be imposed on, incurred by, or 
asserted against any Indemnified Party in any manner relating to or arising 
out of (i) any breach by Borrower or Operating Lessee of its respective 
obligations under, or any material misrepresentation by Borrower contained 
in, this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, or (ii) the use or intended 
use of the proceeds of the Loan (collectively, the Indemnified Liabilities
); provided, however, that Borrower shall not have any obligation to any 
Indemnified Party hereunder to the extent that such Indemnified Liabilities 
arise from the gross negligence, illegal acts, fraud or willful misconduct 
of such Indemnified Party; provided, further, that this Section 10.13(b) 
shall not apply with respect to taxes other than any taxes that represent 
losses or damages arising from any non-tax claim. To the extent that the 
undertaking to indemnify, defend and hold harmless set forth in the 
preceding sentence may be unenforceable because it violates any law or 
public policy, Borrower shall pay the maximum portion that it is permitted 
to pay and satisfy under applicable law to the payment and satisfaction of 
all Indemnified Liabilities incurred by the Indemnified Parties.

(c) Borrower covenants and agrees to pay for or, if Borrower fails to pay,

waiver or confirmation obtained from such Rating Agency pursuant to the

condition precedent to the obtaining of any such consent, approval, waiver 
or confirmation.

its respective officers, directors, partners, employees, representatives, 
agents and Affiliates against any liabilities to which Lender, each of its 
respective officers, directors, partners, employees, representatives, 
agents and Affiliates, may become subject in connection with any 
indemnification to the Rating Agencies in connection with issuing, 
monitoring or maintaining the Securities insofar as the liabilities arise 
out of or are based upon any untrue statement of any material fact in any 
information provided by or on behalf of Borrower or Operating Lessee to the 
Rating Agencies (the Covered Rating Agency Information) or arise out of 
or are based upon the omission to state a material fact in the Covered 
Rating Agency Information required to be stated therein or necessary in 
order to make the statements in the Covered Rating Agency Information, in 
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

or to enforce the performance or observance of any of the obligations 
contained herein or therein. All conditions to the obligations of Lender to 
make the Loan hereunder are imposed solely and exclusively for the benefit

its own judgment and advisors in entering into the Loan without relying in 
any manner on any statements, representations or recommendations of Lender 
or any parent, subsidiary or Affiliate of Lender. Lender shall not be 
subject to any limitation whatsoever in the exercise of any rights or 
remedies available to it under any of the Loan Documents or any other 
agreements or instruments which govern the Loan by virtue of the ownership 
by it or any parent, subsidiary or Affiliate of Lender of any equity 
interest any of them may acquire in Borrower or Operating Lessee, and 
Borrower and Operating Lessee hereby irrevocably waive the right to raise 
any defense or take any action on the basis of the foregoing with respect

termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Debt.

Section 10.22 Prior Agreements. This Agreement and the other Loan Documents 
contain the entire agreement of the parties hereto and thereto in respect

Borrower or Operating Lessee, on the one hand, and Lender, on the other 
hand, are superseded by the terms of this Agreement and the other Loan 
Documents.

Section 10.23 Joint and Several Liability. If Borrower or Operating Lessee

liability is unsecured, may be subject to the write-down and conversion 
powers of an EEA Resolution Authority and agrees and consents to, and 
acknowledges and agrees to be bound by:

Provided Information in the manner and for the purposes set forth in 
Section 9.1 and Section 9.2 of this Agreement, (b) disclosing Provided

Ground Lease Exceptions
 
1. 	The following exceptions hereby exist to the representations and 
warranties set forth in Section 4.1.39(d):

Although the Ground Lease does not permit an assignment to Lender without 
consent, the Ground Lease Estoppel and Agreement, dated October 2, 2016 
(the Estoppel), executed by Ground Lessor provides that Lender (and 
anyone whose title derives directly or indirectly from Lender or mortgagee, 
including a purchaser at any foreclosure sale or assignment in lieu of 
foreclosure) may, without Ground Lessors consent, acquire Borrowers 
interest in the Ground Lease/Ground Leased Property through foreclosure or 
assignment in lieu of foreclosure and may transfer and assign the Ground 
Lease/Ground Leased Property and that the resulting tenant (and its 
assignees) shall thereafter be bound by all applicable terms of the Ground 
Lease (see Section 3(a) of the Estoppel for a complete description).

From and after the date that Lender (or anyone whose title derives directly 
or indirectly from Lender or mortgagee, including a purchaser at any 
foreclosure sale or assignment in lieu of foreclosure) acquires Borrowers 
interest in the Ground Lease, Lender or such transferee shall be required 
to obtain the Ground Lessors consent to assign (see Section 6 of the 
Ground Lease).
 
2. 	The following exceptions hereby exist to the representations and 
warranties set forth in Section 4.1.39(f):

Insurance proceeds are disbursed to Mortgagee, to rebuild, provided that, 
if the damage occurs in the last ten years of the term (and if the proceeds 
are not sufficient to rebuild), Borrower has the right to cancel the Ground 
Lease (see Section 9 of the Ground Lease for a complete description). The 
Ground Lease is silent on whether Borrower can deliver insurance proceeds 
to a lender.

Condemnation proceeds that are attributable to the value of the building 
(as opposed to the land) shall be delivered by the Ground Lessor to 
Borrower (See Section 15 of the Ground Lease for a complete description). 
The Ground Lease is silent about whether condemnation proceeds can be 
payable to a lender.
 
3. 	The following exception hereby exists to the representations and 
warranties set forth in Section 4.1.39(g) and (h):

Pursuant to the Estoppel, Landlord shall not terminate the Ground Lease for 
a default by Borrower until Ground Lessor has given Lender notice of such 
default and the right to cure (see Section 3(b) of the Estoppel for a 
complete description).
 
SCHEDULE 4.1.39-1

------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. 	The following exception hereby exists to the representations and 
warranties set forth in Section 4.1.39(i):

The term of the Ground Lease expires on July 31, 2035, without any right to 
further extend the same, and such term does not, therefore, extend at least 
twenty years beyond the Maturity Date.
 
5. 	The following exception hereby exists to the representations and 
warranties set forth in Section 4.1.39(j):

The Ground Lease is silent as to any obligation of Ground Lessor to enter 
into a new lease upon termination (prior to the expiration of the term 
thereof) of the Ground Lease.

Information as to Grievance:

UNITE HERE Local 5 (the Union) filed a grievance against Borrower 
alleging that Borrower failed to cause a subcontractor of Borrower to 
observe the CBA wage-rate requirement. The Union alleges that this 
subcontractor paid its employees less than the applicable CBA wage-rate. 
The Union seeks back pay in the gross amount of $1.8MM for all allegedly 
adversely-affected current and former employees of subcontractor. Borrower 
believes that the grievance is untimely, and therefore without merit. In 
addition, Borrower believes that the subcontractor would be required to 
indemnify Borrower for any liability related to this grievance. Settlement 
discussions are ongoing.
