THIS TAX MATTERS AGREEMENT (this Agreement) is made and entered into as 
of the day of                         , by and among Hilton Worldwide 
Holdings Inc., a Delaware corporation (HLT), Park Hotels & Resorts Inc., 
a Delaware corporation (PK), Hilton Grand Vacations Inc., a Delaware 
corporation (HGV) and Hilton Domestic Operating Company Inc., a Delaware 
corporation (OpCo). Each of HLT, PK, HGV and OpCo is sometimes referred 
to herein as a Party and, collectively, as the Parties.


WITNESSETH:

WHEREAS, HLT, acting through its direct and indirect Subsidiaries, 
currently conducts a number of businesses, including (i) the HLT Retained 
Business (as defined herein), (ii) the Ownership Business (as defined 
herein) and (iii) the Timeshare Business (as defined herein);

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of HLT (the Board) has determined that it 
is appropriate, desirable and in the best interests of HLT and its 
stockholders to separate HLT into three separate, publicly traded 
companies, one for each of (i) the HLT Retained Business, which shall be 
owned and conducted, directly or indirectly, by HLT, (ii) the Ownership 
Business, which shall be owned and conducted, directly or indirectly, by PK 
(which will elect to be a REIT (as defined herein)) and (iii) the Timeshare 
Business, which shall be owned and conducted, directly or indirectly, by 
HGV;

WHEREAS, in order to effect such separation, the Board has determined that 
it is appropriate, desirable and in the best interests of HLT and its 
stockholders (i) to enter into a series of transactions after giving effect 
to which (A) HLT and/or one or more of its Subsidiaries (as defined herein) 
will, collectively, own all of the HLT Retained Assets (as defined herein) 
and assume (or retain) all of the HLT Retained Liabilities (as defined 
herein), (B) PK and/or one or more of its Subsidiaries will, collectively, 
own all of the Ownership Assets (as defined herein) and assume (or retain) 
all of the Ownership Liabilities (as defined herein) and (C) HGV and/or one 
or more of its Subsidiaries will, collectively, own all of the Timeshare 
Assets (as defined herein) and assume (or retain) all of the Timeshare 
Liabilities (as defined herein) and (ii) for HLT to distribute to the 
holders of its common stock, par value $0.01 per share (HLT Common Stock
), on a pro rata basis (in each case without consideration being paid by 
such stockholders) (A) all of the outstanding shares of common stock, par 
value $0.01 per share, of PK (the PK Common Stock) and (B) all of the 
outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of HGV (the 
HGV Common Stock) (such transactions as they may be amended or modified 
from time to time, collectively, the Plan of Reorganization);

WHEREAS, it is the intention of the Parties that (i) each of the 
contributions by PK of Assets to, and the assumption of Liabilities by, 
OpCo and HGV (each such contribution, an Internal Contribution and 
together, the Internal Contributions) together with the corresponding 
distribution by PK of all of the OpCo common stock and the HGV Common 
Stock, respectively, qualifies as a reorganization within the meaning of 
Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as 
amended (the Code) (each such distribution, an Internal Distribution 
and together, the Internal Distributions), (ii) the use by PK of the Cash 
Proceeds (as defined herein) from OpCo qualifies under Section 361(b) of 
the Code such

------------------------------------------------------------------------
that no gain is recognized upon receipt of the Cash Proceeds by PK in 
connection with any Internal Contribution, (iii) the Debt Exchanges (as 
defined herein) qualify as distributions and exchanges of qualified 
property within the meaning of Section 361(c) of the Code, (iv) the 
distribution by HGV of Cash Proceeds to HLT qualifies first as a payment in 
respect of Tax liabilities allocable to HGV or one of its Subsidiaries 
under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1552-1(b) (or any corresponding 
provisions under U.S. state or local Law), in each case to the extent of 
any such Tax liabilities, and second as as a distribution under Section 301 
of the Code from HGV to HLT, (v) any distribution by OpCo of Cash Proceeds 
to Hilton Worldwide Finance LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (
HWF) qualifies as a distribution under Section 301 of the Code from OpCo 
to HLT, (vi) any distribution by PK of Cash Proceeds to HWF qualifies first 
as a payment in respect of Tax liabilities allocable to PK or one of its 
Subsidiaries under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1552-1(b) (or any 
corresponding provisions under U.S. state or local Law), in each case to 
the extent of any such Tax liabilities, and second as a distribution under 
Section 301 of the Code from PK to HLT and (vii) each of the distributions 
by HLT of all of the PK Common Stock (the PK Distribution) and HGV Common 
Stock (the HGV Distribution and together with the PK Distribution, the 
External Distributions) qualifies as a tax-free distribution within the 
meaning of Section 355 of the Code (collectively, the Intended Tax 
Treatment); and

WHEREAS, in connection with the Plan of Reorganization, the Parties desire 
to set forth their agreement on the rights and obligations with respect to

consent of such other Parties is obtained. The consent of such other 
Parties shall not be withheld unreasonably and shall be deemed to be

amended Tax Return as a result of an Audit adjustment that arose in 
accordance with Article VIII.

DISTRIBUTION TAXES

Section 5.1 Liability for Distribution Taxes. In the event that 
Distribution Taxes become due and payable to a Taxing Authority pursuant to 
a Final Determination or are paid in the reasonable good faith discretion 
of the relevant Audit Representative, then, notwithstanding anything to the 
contrary in this Agreement:

(a) No Fault. If such Distribution Taxes are not attributable to the Fault 
for Distribution Purposes of any Party or any of its Affiliates, the 
responsibility for such Distribution Taxes shall be shared by the Parties 
in accordance with their Sharing Percentages. Notwithstanding anything to 
the contrary in this Agreement, such Distribution Taxes shall not be 
subject to Article III or Section 8.3.

(b) Fault. If such Distribution Taxes are attributable to the Fault for 
Distribution Purposes of one or more Parties or any of their Affiliates, 
the responsibility for such Distribution Taxes shall reside with the Party 
or Parties at Fault for Distribution Purposes. If more than one Party is at 
Fault for Distribution Purposes, the responsibility for the Distribution 
Taxes shall be allocated equally among all of the Parties at Fault for 
Distribution Purposes. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this 
Agreement, such Distribution Taxes shall not be subject to Article III or 
Section 8.3.

Section 5.2 Definition of Fault for Distribution Purposes. For purposes of 
this Agreement, Distribution Taxes shall be deemed to result from the fault 
(Fault for Distribution Purposes) of a Party if such Distribution Taxes 
are attributable to, or result from:

(a) any act, or failure or omission to act, by such Party or any of such 
Partys Affiliates following the Distributions that results in one or more 
Parties (or any of their Affiliates) being responsible for such 
Distribution Taxes pursuant to a Final Determination, regardless of whether 
such act or failure to act (i) is covered by a Post-Distribution Ruling, 
Unqualified Tax Opinion, or waiver in accordance with Section 5.3, or (ii) 
occurs during or after the Restricted Period, or

(b) the direct or indirect acquisition of all or a portion of the stock of 
such Party (or any transaction or series of related transactions that is 
deemed to be such an acquisition for purposes of Section 355(e) of the Code 
and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder) by any means 
whatsoever by any person including pursuant to an issuance or repurchase of

neither PK nor HGV shall (or allow any of their respective Subsidiaries to 
take any such action with respect to PK or HGV):

(a) allow any Proposed Acquisition Transaction to occur with respect to PK 
or HGV (as applicable);

(b) merge or consolidate with any other Person or dissolve, liquidate or

case, excluding sales in the ordinary course of business, sales the net 
cash proceeds (taking into account any Taxes payable) of which are 
reinvested in other assets (including pursuant to an exchange under Section 
1031 of the Code) and sales the net cash proceeds (taking into account any 
Taxes payable) of which are used to repay indebtedness, and measured based 
on fair market values as of the date of the applicable Distribution or 
other transaction);

(e) amend its certificate of incorporation (or other organizational 
documents) or take any other action or approve or allow the taking of any 
action, whether through a stockholder vote or otherwise, in each case that 
affects the economic or voting rights of the stock of such Party (in each 
case, other than certain amendments to such certificates of incorporation 
to be made in connection with the transactions contemplated by that certain 
Stock Purchase Agreement dated as of October 24, 2016 among HNA Tourism 
Group Company Limited and the seller parties named therein);

(f) purchase, directly or through any Affiliate, any of its outstanding

the requirements of Section 4.05(1)(b) of Revenue Procedure 96-30;

(g) take any action or fail to take any action, or permit any of its

or in the Tax Representation Letters, or that is inconsistent with any 
rulings or opinions in the IRS Ruling or any Tax Opinion;

(h) in the case of PK, materially reduce the size or scope of the Select

the Code with respect to any of the assets comprising the Select Hotels 
Business or the Hotel Laundry Business; or

(j) enter into an arrangement or agreement to do any of the foregoing.

provided, however, that a Party (the Requesting Party) shall be permitted 
to take such action or one or more actions set forth in the foregoing 
clauses (a) through (g) if such action is described in the Reorganization 
Slide Deck or if, prior to taking any such actions: (1) such Requesting 
Party or HLT shall have received a favorable private letter ruling from the 
IRS, or a ruling from another Taxing Authority (a Post-Distribution Ruling
), in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to HLT and upon which 
HLT, PK and HGV are entitled to rely that confirms that such action or 
actions will not result in Distribution Taxes, taking into account such 
actions and any other relevant transactions in the aggregate; (2) such 
Requesting Party shall have received an Unqualified Tax Opinion that 
confirms that such action or actions will not result in Distribution Taxes, 
taking into account such actions and any other relevant transactions in the 
aggregate; or (3) such Requesting Party shall have received a written 
statement from each of the other Parties that provides that such other 
Party waives the requirement to obtain a Post-Distribution Ruling or 
Unqualified Tax Opinion described in this paragraph. The Requesting Party 
shall bear all costs and expenses of securing any such Post-Distribution 
Ruling or Unqualified Tax Opinion.

Section 5.4 Certain Limitations on PK with Respect to its Stock.

(a) During the Restricted Period, PK may not issue any of its stock or take 
any action with respect to its stock that would cause an Acquisition 
(including redemptions or repurchases), or issue any options or other 
instruments that grant the holder a right (including if PK has a right to 
settle the obligation with property other than PK stock) to complete an 
Acquisition (any such issuance or other transaction, a PK Issuance); 
provided that HGV shall have no right to enforce this Section 5.4(a) 
against PK.

(b) Notwithstanding Section 5.4(a), a PK Issuance shall be permitted if, 
immediately after such PK Issuance, the PK Applicable Percentage will be 
less than or equal to the PK Percentage Shift Limit.

(c) Notwithstanding Section 5.4(a), a PK Issuance shall be permitted where 
such PK Issuance (or the related issuance of stock in the case of an option 
issuance) is described in Treasury Regulations Section 1.355-7(d)(8) (other 
than a PK Issuance made in connection with a merger or other acquisition 
transaction by a third party; provided, that no PK Issuance will be deemed 
to be connected with an acquisition pursuant to a secondary sale for cash 
of PK stock by one or more Blackstone Entities in a public offering).

(d) Notwithstanding Section 5.4(a), a PK Issuance shall be permitted if PK 
provides an Unqualified 355(e) Opinion to HLT; provided, further, that in 
the case of a PK Issuance of stock pursuant to an exercise of an option or 
other instrument that grants the holder a right (including if PK has a 
right to settle the obligation with property other than PK stock) to 
complete such an acquisition, such PK Issuance shall be permitted if PK 
provided an Unqualified 355(e) Opinion to HLT in respect of the PK Issuance 
of such option or other instrument.
 
21

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(e) A PK Issuance which is permitted pursuant to Section 5.4(c) or (d) 
shall be disregarded for purposes of clauses (a)(i) and (b)(i) of the 
definition of PK Applicable Percentage.

(f) Upon a Reallocation Event with respect to PK stock, the Blackstone 
Representative, on the one hand, and PK, on the other, shall use reasonable 
efforts to allocate the Reallocation Event Reduction to and reduce the 
Blackstone-PK Percentage Shift Limit and/or PK Percentage Shift Limit. If 
the Blackstone Representative and PK do not agree on an allocation, the 
Reallocation Event Reduction shall first be allocated to and reduce the PK 
Percentage Shift Limit (but not below the PK Applicable Percentage as of 
the time of the Reallocation Event). Any excess Reallocation Event 
Reduction shall be allocated to and reduce the Blackstone-PK Percentage 
Shift Limit (but not below the Blackstone-PK Applicable Percentage as of 
the time of the Reallocation Event). For the avoidance of doubt, the sum 
(immediately before the Reallocation Event) of the Blackstone-PK Percentage 
Shift Limit and PK Percentage Shift Limit shall equal the sum (immediately 
after the Reallocation Event), of the Reallocation Event Reduction plus 
Blackstone-PK Percentage Shift Limit and PK Percentage Shift Limit. 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.4(f), if the 
Blackstone Representative or PK provides an Unqualified 355(e) Opinion with 
respect to a purported Reallocation Event to HLT, such purported 
Reallocation Event shall not constitute a Reallocation Event.

(g) During the Restricted Period, if a proposed PK Issuance is a redemption 
or repurchase, then, immediately before such PK Issuance, (i) the 
Blackstone-PK Percentage Shift Limit shall be increased or decreased (but 
not below the Blackstone-PK Applicable Percentage as of immediately before 
such PK Issuance) such that the number of shares permitted to be Disposed 
of under Section 2.2(a)(ii) of the Stockholders Agreement remains unchanged 
immediately after such PK Issuance (other than to reflect shares of PK 
actually redeemed or repurchased from the Blackstone Entities pursuant to 
such PK Issuance), and (ii) the PK Percentage Shift Limit shall be 
decreased (in the case of an increase in clause (i), but not below the PK 
Applicable Percentage as of immediately before such PK Issuance) or 
increased (in the case of a decrease in clause (i)) by the amount set forth 
in clause (i). If clause (ii) calls for a reduction in the PK Percentage 
Shift Limit and the amount of such reduction would be limited by the 
parenthetical therein, then, notwithstanding any other provision of this 
Agreement (including Section 5.4(d)), PK shall not undertake such PK 
Issuance without the written consent of the Blackstone Representative; 
provided that in the event the Blackstone Representative so consents, the 
amount of the increase set forth in (i) shall not exceed the amount of the 
decrease set forth in (ii). For the avoidance of doubt, a PK Issuance that 
satisfies the requirements of this Section 5.4(g) remains subject to the 
provisions of this Agreement, including, without limitation, this Section 
5.4. For the avoidance of doubt, if a proposed PK Issuance is not 
consummated, the Blackstone-PK Percentage Shift Limit and PK Percentage 
Shift Limit shall not be adjusted pursuant to this Section 5.4(g) as a 
result of such proposed PK Issuance.

(h) For purposes of computing the (a) PK Applicable Percentage, (b) 
Blackstone-PK Applicable Percentage or (c) Reallocation Event Reduction, 
any calculation of the shift of ownership of PK under Section 355(e) shall 
take into account (i) any IRS private letter ruling received by one or more 
of HLT, PK, HGV and/or the Blackstone Entities and (ii) any unqualified 
will opinion of a Qualified Tax Advisor (or, with respect to an opinion 
delivered by HLT, should opinion) addressed to HLT and in form and 
substance reasonably satisfactory to HLT, without substantive 
qualifications, in each case addressing the manner in which the calculation 
of such shift is performed.
 
22

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(i) The provisions of this Section 5.4 are intended for the benefit of, and 
shall be enforceable by, each of the Blackstone Entities.

Section 5.5 IRS Ruling, Tax Representation Letters, and Tax Opinions; 
Consistency. Each Party represents that the information and representations 
furnished with respect to such Party or its Subsidiaries in or in 
connection with the IRS Ruling, the Tax Representation Letters, or the Tax 
Opinions are accurate and complete as of the Effective Time. Each Party 
covenants that if, after the Effective Time, it or any of its Affiliates 
obtains information indicating, or otherwise becomes aware, that any such 
information or representations is or may be inaccurate or incomplete, to 
promptly inform the other Parties.

Section 5.6 Timing of Payment of Taxes. All Distribution Taxes required to 
be paid or caused to be paid by a Party to a Taxing Authority under 
applicable Law shall be paid or caused to be paid by such Party on or prior 
to the Due Date of such Distribution Taxes. All amounts required to be paid 
by one Party to another Party (including obligations arising under Article 
VI) pursuant to this Article V shall be paid or caused to be paid by such 
first Party to such other Party in accordance with Article VII.

Section 5.7 Protective Section 336(e) Elections.

(a) PK, on the one hand, and each of OpCo and HGV, on the other, shall make 
a protective election under Section 336(e) of the Code (and any similar 
election under state or local law) with respect to the applicable Internal 
Distribution in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.336-2(h) and 
(j) (and any applicable provisions under state and local law), and the 
Parties shall cooperate in the timely completion and/or filings of such 
elections and any related filings or procedures (including filing or 
amending any Tax Returns to implement an election that becomes effective). 
This Section 5.7(a) is intended to constitute binding, written agreements 
to make elections under Section 336(e) of the Code with respect to the 
Internal Distributions. If an election under Section 336(e) of the Code is 
unavailable to PK, on the one hand, and OpCo or HGV, on the other, in 
connection with the applicable Internal Distribution, PK and HLT shall (and 
shall cause their Affiliates to) cooperate in making an effective election 
under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and any similar election under state 
or local law) with respect to such applicable Internal Distribution and 
cooperate with respect to any related filings or procedures (including 
having PK and HLT file an election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code 
under the relief provisions of Treasury Regulation Sections 301.9100-1, et. 
seq. and filing or amending any Tax Returns to implement an election that 
becomes effective).

(b) HLT and HGV shall make a protective election under Section 336(e) of 
the Code (and any similar election under state or local law) with respect 
to the HGV Distribution in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 
1.336-2(h) and (j) (and any applicable provisions under state and local 
law) and shall cooperate in the timely completion and/or filings of such 
elections and any related filings or procedures (including filing or 
amending any Tax Returns to implement an election that becomes effective). 
This Section 5.7(b) is intended to constitute a binding, written agreement 
to make an election under Section 336(e) of the Code with respect to the 
HGV Distribution.
 
23

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(c) HLT shall, within six (6) months of the Distribution Date, determine in 
its good faith discretion whether HLT and PK and/or any additional 
applicable parent and subsidiary entities shall make a protective election 
under Section 336(e) of the Code (and any similar election under state or 
local law) in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.336-2(h) and 
(j) (and any applicable provisions under state and local law) with respect 
to the PK or the Subsidiaries of HLT immediately before the first of the 
External Distributions. If HLT so determines that HLT and PK and/or an 
applicable parent and subsidiary entity shall make a protective election 
under Section 336(e), the relevant Parties shall cooperate (and shall cause 
their respective Affiliates to cooperate) in the timely completion and/or 
filings of such elections and any related filings or procedures and any 
similar procedures or relief provisions with respect to Section 338(h)(10) 
of the Code in the event a protective election under Section 336(e) is not 
available with respect to an Internal Distribution. The Parties shall 
cooperate (and shall cause their respective Affiliates to cooperate) in 
causing HLT and PK and/or the applicable parent and subsidiary entities to 
enter into binding agreements to make such elections under Section 336(e) 
of the Code within twenty (20) days following such determination.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in the event that an 
election contemplated in Section 5.7 is made and becomes effective, then 
the Parties shall share in the Tax Benefit Actually Realized as a result of 
such election in accordance with the Parties relative responsibility for 
such Taxes under this Article V, and payments shall be made between the 
Parties, if necessary.


ARTICLE VI

INDEMNIFICATION

Section 6.1 Indemnification Obligations of HLT. HLT and OpCo shall jointly 
and severally indemnify PK and its Affiliates and HGV and its Affiliates 
and hold the indemnified party harmless from and against (without 
duplication):

(a) all Taxes and other amounts for which the HLT Group is responsible 
under this Agreement and any related Losses; and

(b) all Taxes and Losses attributable to a breach of any representation, 
covenant, or obligation of HLT or OpCo under this Agreement.

Section 6.2 Indemnification Obligations of PK. PK shall indemnify OpCo and 
its Affiliates and HGV and its Affiliates and hold them harmless from and 
against (without duplication):

(a) all Taxes and other amounts for which the PK Group is responsible under 
this Agreement and any related Losses; and

(b) all Taxes and Losses attributable to a breach of any representation, 
covenant, or obligation of PK under this Agreement.

its Affiliates and PK and its Affiliates and hold them harmless from and 
against (without duplication):

(a) all Taxes and other amounts for which the HGV Group is responsible 
under this Agreement and any related Losses; and

(b) all Taxes and Losses attributable to a breach of any representation, 
covenant or obligation of HGV under this Agreement.

Section 6.4 Protected REITs. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in 
this Agreement, in the event that counsel or independent accountants for a 
Protected REIT determine that there exists a material risk that any 
indemnification payments due under this Agreement would be treated as 
Nonqualifying Income upon the payment of such amounts to the relevant 
Indemnified Party, the amount paid to the Indemnified Party pursuant to 
this Agreement in any tax year shall not exceed the maximum amount that can 
be paid to the Indemnified Party in such year without causing the Protected 
REIT to fail to meet the REIT Requirements for any tax year, determined as 
if the payment of such amount were Nonqualifying Income as determined by 
such counsel or independent accountants to the Protected REIT. If the 
amount payable for any tax year pursuant to the preceding sentence is less 
than the amount which the relevant Indemnifying Party would otherwise be 
obligated to pay to the relevant Indemnified Party pursuant to this 
Agreement (the Expense Amount), then: (1) the Indemnifying Party shall 
place the Expense Amount into an escrow account (the Escrow Account) 
using an escrow agent and agreement reasonably acceptable to the 
Indemnified Party (which shall include that (y) the amount in the Escrow 
Account shall be treated as the property of the Indemnifying Party, unless 
it is released from such Escrow Account to the Indemnified Party, and (z) 
all income earned upon the amount in the Escrow Account shall be treated as 
the property of the Indemnifying Party and reported, as and to the extent 
required by applicable Law, by the escrow agent to the IRS, or any other 
taxing authority, on IRS Form 1099 or 1042S (or other appropriate form) as 
income earned by the Indemnifying Party whether or not said income has been 
distributed during such taxable year) and shall not release any portion 
thereof to the Indemnified Party, and the Indemnified Party shall not be 
entitled to any such amount, unless and until the Indemnified Party 
delivers to the Indemnifying Party, at the sole option of the relevant 
Protected REIT, (i) an opinion (an Expense Amount Tax Opinion) of the 
Protected REITs tax counsel to the effect that such amount, if and to the 
extent paid, would not constitute Nonqualifying Income, (ii) a letter (an 
Expense Amount Accountants Letter) from the Protected REITs independent 
accountants indicating the maximum portion of the Expense Amount that can 
be paid at that time to the Indemnified Party without causing the Protected 
REIT to fail to meet the REIT Requirements for any relevant taxable year, 
or (iii) a private letter ruling issued by the IRS to the Protected REIT 
indicating that the receipt of any Expense Amount hereunder will not cause 
the Protected REIT to fail to satisfy the REIT Requirements (a REIT 
Qualification Ruling and, collectively with an Expense Amount Tax Opinion 
and an Expense Amount Accountants Letter, a Release Document); (2) 
pending the delivery of a Release Document by the Indemnified Party to the 
Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall have the right, but not the 
obligation, to borrow the Expense Amount from the Escrow Account pursuant 
to a loan agreement reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party that (i) 
requires the Indemnifying Party to lend the Indemnified Party immediately 
available cash proceeds in an amount equal to the Expense
 
25

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amount, and (ii) provides for (A) a commercially reasonable interest rate 
and commercially reasonable covenants, taking into account the credit 
standing and profile of the Indemnified Party or any guarantor of the 
Indemnified Party, including the Protected REIT, at the time of such loan, 
and (B) a fifteen (15) year maturity with no periodic amortization; and (3) 
the Indemnified Party shall bear all costs and expenses with respect to the 
escrow as contemplated by clauses (1) and (2) in this Section 6.4.


ARTICLE VII

PAYMENTS

Section 7.1 Payments.

(a) General. In the event that an Indemnifying Party is required to make a 
payment to an Indemnified Party pursuant to this Agreement, such payment 
shall be made to the Indemnified Party within the time prescribed for 
payment in this Agreement, or if no period is prescribed, within twenty 
(20) days after delivery of written notice of payment owing together with a 
computation of the amounts due. If the Indemnifying Party fails to make a 
payment to the Indemnified Party within the time period set forth in this 
Section 7.1 or as otherwise provided in this Agreement, such Indemnifying 
Party shall pay to the Indemnified Party interest that accrues (at a rate 
equal to LIBOR) on the amount of such payment from the time that such 
payment was due to the Indemnified Party until the date that payment is 
actually made to the Indemnified Party; provided, however, that this 
provision for interest shall not be construed to give the Indemnifying 
Party the right to defer payment beyond the due date hereunder.

(b) Right of Setoff. It is expressly understood that an Indemnifying Party 
is hereby authorized to set off and apply any and all amounts required to 
be paid to an Indemnified Party pursuant to this Section 7.1 against any 
and all of the obligations of the Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying 
Party arising under Section 7.1 of this Agreement that are then either due 
and payable or past due, irrespective of whether such Indemnifying Party 
has made any demand for payment with respect to such obligations.

Section 7.2 Treatment of Payments made Pursuant to Tax Matters Agreement. 
Unless otherwise required by a Final Determination or this Agreement or 
otherwise agreed to among the Parties, for U.S. federal Tax purposes, any 
payment (other than payments of interest pursuant to Section 7.1(a)) made 
pursuant to this Agreement by:

(a) PK to OpCo shall be treated for all Tax purposes as a tax-free 
contribution by PK to OpCo with respect to its stock occurring immediately 
before the Internal Distribution of OpCo common stock;

(b) HGV to HLT shall be treated for all Tax purposes as a distribution by 
HGV to HLT with respect to its stock occurring after HGV is directly owned 
by HLT and immediately before the HGV Distribution;

(c) OpCo to PK shall be treated for all Tax purposes as a distribution by 
OpCo to PK with respect to stock of OpCo occurring immediately before the 
Internal Distribution of OpCo common stock;
 
26

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(d) HLT to PK shall be treated for all Tax purposes as a tax-free 
contribution by HLT to PK with respect to its stock occurring immediately 
before the PK Distribution;

(e) HLT to HGV shall be treated for all Tax purposes as a tax-free 
contribution by HLT to HGV with respect to its stock occurring after HGV is 
directly owned by HLT and immediately before the HGV Distribution;

(f) PK to HGV shall be treated for all Tax purposes as a tax-free 
contribution by PK to HGV with respect to its stock occurring immediately 
before the Internal Distribution of HGV Common Stock;

(g) HGV to PK shall be treated for all Tax purposes as a distribution by 
HGV to PK with respect to its stock occurring immediately before the 
Internal Distribution of HGV Common Stock; and

(h) in each case, none of the Parties shall take any position inconsistent 
with such treatment. In the event that a Taxing Authority asserts that a 
Partys treatment of a payment pursuant to this Agreement should be other 
than as required pursuant to this Agreement (ignoring any potential 
inconsistent or adverse Final Determination), such Party shall use its 
commercially reasonable efforts to contest such challenge.

Section 7.3 Payments Net of Tax Benefit Actually Realized and Tax Cost. 
Subject to Section 5.7(d), all amounts required to be paid by one Party to 
another pursuant to this Agreement or the Distribution Agreement shall be 
reduced by the Tax Benefit Actually Realized by the Indemnified Party or 
its Affiliates in the taxable year the payment is made or any prior taxable 
year as a result of the claim giving rise to the payment. If the receipt or 
accrual of any such payment (other than payments of interest pursuant 
Section 11.11 of the Distribution Agreement or Section 7.1(a)) results in 
taxable income to the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates, such payment 
shall be increased so that, after the payment of any Taxes with respect to 
the payment, the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates shall have realized 
the same net amount it would have realized had the payment not resulted in 
taxable income.


ARTICLE VIII

AUDITS

Section 8.1 Notice. Within twenty (20) Business Days after a Party or any 
of its Affiliates receives a written notice from a Taxing Authority of the 
existence of an Audit that may require indemnification pursuant to this 
Agreement, that Party shall notify the other Parties of such receipt and 
send such notice to the other Parties via overnight mail. The failure of 
one Party to notify the other Parties of an Audit shall not relieve such 
other Party of any liability and/or obligation that it may have under this 
Agreement, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Partys rights under 
this Agreement are materially prejudiced by such failure.

Section 8.2 Audits.

administer and control all Audits of Pre-Distribution Income Tax Returns.

(ii) Audits of PK Straddle Income Tax Returns, HGV Straddle Income Tax 
Returns, Post-Distribution Income Tax Returns, and Non-Income Tax Returns 
shall be administered and controlled by the Party and its Subsidiaries that 
would be primarily liable under applicable Law to pay to the applicable 
Taxing Authority the Taxes resulting from such Audits. Audits of 
Post-Distribution Income Tax Returns and Non-Income Tax Returns for taxable 
periods beginning after the Distribution Date shall not be subject to 
Sections 8.2(b) and 8.2(c).

(b) Administration and Control; Cooperation.

(i) Subject to Sections 8.2(b)(ii) and 8.2(c), the Audit Management Party 
shall have absolute authority to make all decisions (determined in its sole 
discretion) with respect to the administration and control of such Audit, 
including the selection of all external advisors. In that regard, the Audit 
Management Party (a) may in its sole discretion settle or otherwise 
determine not to continue to contest any issue related to such Audit 
without the consent of the other Parties, and (b) shall, as soon as 
reasonably practicable and prior to settlement of an issue that could cause 
one or more other Parties to become responsible for Taxes under Section 
8.3, notify the Audit Representatives of such other Parties of such 
settlement. The other Parties shall (and shall cause their Affiliates to) 
undertake all actions and execute all documents (including an extension of 
the applicable statute of limitations) that are determined in the sole 
discretion of the Audit Management Party to be necessary to effectuate such 
administration and control. The Parties shall act in good faith and use 
their reasonable best efforts to cooperate fully with each other Party (and 
their Affiliates) in connection with such Audit and shall provide or cause 
their Subsidiaries to provide such information to each other as may be 
necessary or useful with respect to such Audit in a timely manner, identify 
and provide access to potential witnesses, and other persons with knowledge 
and other information within its control and reasonably necessary to the 
resolution of the Audit.

(ii) In the case of any Audit in respect of Distribution Taxes for which a 
Party could be liable pursuant to Section 5.1(b), such Party shall have the 
rights of a Participating Party described in Section 8.2(c); provided, 
however, that the relevant Audit Management Party shall not settle such 
Audit without the prior written consent of such Party that could be liable 
for Distribution Taxes pursuant to Section 5.1(b). In the event more than 
one Party would be liable under Section 5.1(b), such Parties shall each 
have the rights described in this Section 8.2(b)(ii) with respect to such 
Audit.

(c) Participation Rights of Parties and Information Sharing with respect to 
Audits.

(i) Each Party that would be responsible under Section 8.3 for Taxes 
resulting from an Audit (other than the Audit Management Party) (a 
Participating Party) shall have the rights as set forth in this Section 
8.2(c) with respect to such Audit. Upon the reasonable request of a 
Participating Party, the Audit Management Party shall make available 
relevant personnel and external advisors to meet with the Participating 
Party and its independent auditor in order to review the status of the 
Audits. The Participating Parties shall provide the Audit Management Party 
with reasonable notice of such requested meetings or information.
 
28

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(ii) Each Participating Party shall have access to any written 
documentation in the possession of the Audit Management Party that pertains 
to the Audit (including any written summaries of issues that the Audit 
Management Party has developed in the context of evaluating the financial 
reporting of the Audit); provided, however, that if documentation was 
prepared solely by or on behalf of a Party, then the documentation must 
relate to the joint defense of the Audit. Copies of the documentation will 
be made available to the Participating Parties at their sole cost and 
expense.

(iii) Upon becoming aware of any scheduled meeting or scheduled phone call 
with an Audit agent, the Audit Management Party shall use commercially 
reasonable efforts to inform each Participating Party of the time, location 
and/or expected subject matter of such meeting or phone call. Such 
Participating Party shall be entitled to designate a representative to 
attend such meeting or phone call (it being understood that the Audit 
Management Party shall not have any obligation to reschedule any such 
meeting or phone call to facilitate such representatives attendance); 
provided, however, that such Participating Party (and its representative) 
may not actively participate in such meeting or phone call.

(iv) The Participating Parties are encouraged to provide consultation to 
the Audit Management Party in regards to Audit strategy and shall, upon 
request of the Audit Management Party, provide such consultation. The 
Participating Party may elect to employ separate counsel to advise the 
Participating Party as additional counsel in or in connection with an 
Audit, but in that event, the fees and expenses of the separate counsel 
shall be paid solely by the Participating Party. The Audit Management Party 
shall in good faith consider all advice and other input received from the 
Participating Parties in connection with their consultations with respect 
to an Audit. However, the Audit Management Party shall retain the sole 
authority to make all Audit decisions. In that regard, the Participating 
Parties and their separate counsels shall not be allowed to participate in 
any Audit-related meetings other than those described in (i), (ii) or (iii) 
above, respond directly to a Taxing Authority conducting the Audit, or in 
any manner control resolution of the Audit.

(d) Power of Attorney/Officer Signature. Each Party hereby appoints (and 
shall cause its Subsidiaries to appoint) the Audit Management Party (and 
its designated representatives) as its agent and attorney-in-fact to take 
the actions the Audit Management Party deems necessary or appropriate to 
implement the responsibilities of the Audit Management Party under this 
Agreement. Each Party also shall (or shall cause its Subsidiaries to) 
execute and deliver to the Audit Management Party a power of attorney, and 
such other documents as are reasonably requested from time to time by the 
Audit Management Party (or its designee).

Section 8.3 Payment of Audit Amounts.

Audit of any Income Tax Return or Non-Income Tax Return, in each case for a 
Pre-Distribution Tax Period or a Straddle Tax Period:

(i) A member of the HLT Group shall be liable for and shall pay or cause to 
be paid to the applicable Taxing Authority, PK or HGV (as the case may be) 
the HLT Allocable Audit Portion owed as a result of such Audit;
 
29

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(ii) PK shall be liable for and shall pay or cause to be paid to the 
applicable Taxing Authority, a member of the HLT Group or HGV (as the case 
may be) the PK Allocable Audit Portion owed as a result of such Audit;

(iii) HGV shall be liable for and shall pay or cause to be paid to the 
applicable Taxing Authority, a member of the HLT Group or PK (as the case 
may be) the HGV Allocable Audit Portion owed as a result of such Audit.

(b) All additional U.S. federal, state or local Income Taxes for a 
Pre-Distribution Tax Period or a Straddle Tax Period due and payable as a 
result of an Audit of an Income Tax Return for a Pre-Distribution Tax 
Period or a Straddle Tax Period relating to an item listed on Schedule 
8.3(b) (including any corresponding or correlative adjustments for U.S. 
federal, state or local Income Tax purposes) (Specified Audit Taxes) 
shall be allocated first, to a member of the HLT Group up to an aggregate 
amount equal to ninety million dollars ($90,000,000), and second, among the 
Parties in accordance with their respective Sharing Percentages. All 
additional Taxes that are Restructuring Taxes and are due and payable as a 
result of an Audit shall be allocated among the Parties in accordance with 
their respective Sharing Percentages. Each Party shall be liable for any

Taxes so allocated to it.

(c) Third Party Indemnity Payments. Any benefit or liability resulting from 
any Tax sharing, contractual indemnity agreements or similar agreements, 
written or unwritten, as between any of the Parties or their respective 
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any other third party, on the other hand 
(other than the Distribution Agreement, this Agreement or any other 
Ancillary Agreement) (Tax Sharing Agreements), shall remain the benefit 
or liability of such Party or its respective Subsidiary; provided, however, 
that the Party responsible under this Agreement for any Taxes shall be 
responsible for any related liability in respect of such Taxes under any 
Tax Sharing Agreement, and be entitled to any related benefit in respect of 
such Taxes under any Tax Sharing Agreement. No Party shall be entitled to 
indemnification under this Agreement in respect of Taxes to the extent such 
Party or one of its Subsidiaries is indemnified under any Tax Sharing 
Agreement, and the Parties shall (and shall cause their Subsidiaries to) 
use commercially reasonable efforts to pursue any indemnification rights 
under any Tax Sharing Agreement if such indemnification would reduce the 
other Partys responsibility for such Taxes under this Agreement.


ARTICLE IX

Authorities;

(b) the execution of any document that may be necessary or reasonably

and expenses incurred by the Parties as a result of cooperating pursuant to 
this Section 9.1.

Parties or their respective Subsidiaries intends to dispose of any 
documentation relating to the Taxes of the Parties or their respective 
Subsidiaries for which another Party to this Agreement may be responsible 
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (including, without limitation, Tax 
Returns, books, records, documentation, and other information, accompanying 
schedules, related work papers, and documents relating to rulings or other 
determinations by Taxing Authorities), such Party shall or shall cause 
written notice to the other Parties describing the documentation to be

action. The other Parties may arrange to take delivery of the documentation

ARTICLE X

ALLOCATION OF TAX ATTRIBUTES
AND OTHER TAX MATTERS

Section 10.1 Allocation of Tax Attributes. HLT shall in good faith advise 
each of PK and HGV in writing of the portion, if any, of any Tax 
Attributes, earnings and profits, or other consolidated, combined or 
unitary attribute that HLT determines shall be allocated or apportioned to 
each Group under applicable Law; provided, however, that such determination 
shall be made in a manner that is: (a) reasonably consistent with the past 
practices of the Parties; (b) in accordance with the rules prescribed by 
applicable Law, including the Code and the Treasury Regulations; and (c) 
consistent with the IRS Ruling, the Tax Representation Letters, and the Tax 
Opinions. HLT agrees to provide the other Parties with all of the 
information supporting the Tax Attribute and other determinations made by 
HLT pursuant to this Section 10.1. In the case of an Audit of 
Pre-Distribution Income Tax Returns that results in an increase in the 
earnings and profits allocated to PK, PK may be required to pay a 
deficiency dividend, in accordance with Section 860 of the Code, within 
ninety (90) days after the determination, as defined in Section 860 of 
the Code. To provide PK with sufficient notice so that PK can make 
arrangements to pay such a deficiency dividend within ninety (90) days 
after the determination, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this 
Agreement, HLT agrees to keep PK informed of any Audit of Pre-Distribution 
Income Tax Returns that could result in an increase in the earnings and 
profits allocated to PK, and HLT agrees to notify PK of a determination 
with respect to such Audit within five (5) Business Days after such 
determination.

Section 10.2 Allocation of Tax Items. All determinations for purposes of 
this Agreement regarding the allocation of Income Tax items (other than Tax 
items arising on the Distribution Date but after the applicable 
Distribution that are outside the ordinary course of business) between the 
portion of a Straddle Tax Period that ends on the Distribution Date and the 
portion that begins the day after the Distribution Date shall be made based 
on a closing of the books method under the principles of Treasury 
Regulation 1.1502-76 (and any similar rule under U.S. state, local or 
non-U.S. Law) as determined by HLT on any HLT Combined Income Tax Return, 
unless in each case the Parties unanimously agree otherwise; provided, 
however, any Taxes in respect of actions taken outside the ordinary course 
of business on the date of an External Distribution but after such External 
Distribution shall be deemed to arise the day after such External 
Distribution. Any such allocation of Tax items shall initially be made by 
HLT. To the extent that HGV or PK disagrees with such determination, the 
dispute shall be resolved by an Big Four Accounting Firm mutually agreed 
upon by the Parties for a final binding resolution. For purposes of 
preparing any Income Tax Returns for the year of the Distributions that 
require
 
32

------------------------------------------------------------------------
an allocation of Tax items between a Pre-Distribution Tax Period and a 
Post-Distribution Tax Period, Tax items shall be allocated based on a 
closing of the books method under Treasury Regulation 1.1502-76 (and any 
similar rule under U.S. state, local or non-U.S. Law) as determined by HLT 
on any HLT Combined Income Tax Return, unless the Parties unanimously agree 
otherwise. Except for the transactions contemplated in the Reorganization 
Slide Deck or any Implementing Agreement, HGV and PK shall not (and shall 
not permit any member of their respective Groups to) take any action 
outside the ordinary course of business on the date of an External 
Distribution but after such External Distribution.


ARTICLE XI

DEFAULTED AMOUNTS

Section 11.1 General. In the event that one or more Parties defaults on its 
obligation to pay Distribution Taxes for which it is liable pursuant to 
Article V to another Party, then each non-defaulting Party shall be 
required to fund a portion of such Distribution Taxes in accordance with 
the Sharing Percentages of the non-defaulting Parties; provided, however, 
that no payment obligation shall exist under this Section 11.1 with respect 
to Distribution Taxes that are attributable to the Fault for Distribution 
Purposes of one or more Parties; provided, further, that any payment of 
Distribution Taxes by a non-defaulting Party pursuant to this Section 11.1 
shall in no way release the defaulting Party from its obligations to pay 
such Distribution Taxes and any non-defaulting Party may exercise any 
available legal remedies available against such defaulting Party; provided, 
further, that interest shall accrue on any such payment by a non-defaulting 
Party at a rate per annum equal to the then applicable LIBOR. In connection 
with the foregoing, it is expressly understood that any defaulting Partys 
rights to any amounts to be received by such defaulting Party hereunder may 
be used via a right of offset to satisfy, in whole or in part, the 
obligations of such defaulting Party to pay the Distribution Taxes that are 
borne by the non-defaulting Parties; such rights of offset shall be applied 
in favor of the non-defaulting Party or Parties in proportion to the 
additional amounts paid by any such non-defaulting Party or Parties.


ARTICLE XII

DISPUTE RESOLUTION

Section 12.1 Negotiation. In the event of a dispute arising out of or in

or validity) (collectively, Agreement Disputes), the senior tax officers 
of the relevant Parties (or such other individuals designated thereby) 
shall negotiate for a maximum of 21 days (or a mutually-agreed extension) 
(such period of days, the Negotiation Period) from the time of receipt by 
a Party of written notice of such Agreement Dispute. The relevant Parties 
shall not assert the defenses of statute of limitations and laches for any 
delays arising due to the procedures in Sections 12.1 or 12.2.

Section 12.2 Mediation. If the Parties have not timely resolved the 
Agreement Dispute under Section 12.1, the Parties agree to submit the 
Agreement Dispute to mediation no later than 10 days following the end of 
the Negotiation Period, with such mediation to be
 
33

------------------------------------------------------------------------
conducted in accordance with the Mediation Procedure of the International 
Institute for Conflict Prevention and Resolution (CPR). The Parties to 
the Agreement Dispute agree to bear equally the CPR and mediators costs 
for same. The Parties agree to participate in good faith in the mediation 
for a maximum of 14 days (or a mutually agreed extension). If the Parties 
have not timely resolved the Agreement Dispute pursuant to this Section 
12.2, either Party may then bring an action in accordance with Sections 
13.15 and 13.16 herein.

Section 12.3 Confidentiality. All information and communications between 
the Parties relating to an Agreement Dispute and/or under the procedures in 
Sections 12.1 and 12.2 shall be considered Confidential Information for 
which the provisions of Section 8.6 of the Distribution Agreement shall 
apply herein, mutatis mutandis.

Section 13.17 Force Majeure. No Party (or any Person acting on its behalf) 
shall have any liability or responsibility for failure to fulfill any 
obligation (other than a payment obligation) under this Agreement so long 
as and to the extent to which the fulfillment of such obligation is

circumstances of Force Majeure (as defined in the Distribution Agreement). 
A Party claiming the benefit of this provision shall, as soon as reasonably 
practicable after the occurrence of any such event: (a) notify the other

(b) If, due to any change in applicable Law or regulations or their 
interpretation by any court of Law or other governing body having 
jurisdiction subsequent to the date hereof, performance of any provision of 
this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby shall become

contemplated by such provision.

negotiations to replace the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions 
with valid provisions, the economic effect of which comes as close as 
possible to that of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions.

Schedule 8.3(b)
 
  	 	  	The IRS has asserted that certain foreign currency denominated 
intercompany loans, from HLTs foreign subsidiaries to certain U.S. 
subsidiaries, should be recharacterized as equity for U.S. federal income 
tax purposes and should constitute deemed dividends from such foreign 
subsidiaries to the U.S. subsidiaries as described in Note 12 of HLTs 
financial statements included in its Form 10Q filing for the quarterly 
period ending September 30, 2016.
 
  	 	  	In calculating the amount of U.S. taxable income resulting from 
the Hilton HHonors guest loyalty program, the IRS has taken a position that 
Hilton HHonors Worldwide, L.L.C. should not reduce gross income by the 
estimated costs of future redemptions, but rather such costs would be 
deductible only at the time the points are redeemed as described in Note 12 
of HLTs financial statements included in its Form 10Q filing for the 
quarterly period ending September 30, 2016.
 
  	 	  	The IRS has asserted that foreign currency denominated loans 
entered into by one of HLTs Luxembourg subsidiaries whose functional 
currency is the U.S. Dollar, should instead be treated as entered into by 
one of HLTs Belgian subsidiaries whose functional currency is the Euro, 
and thus foreign currency gains and losses with respect to such loans 
should have been measured in Euros, instead of the U.S. Dollar as described 
in Note 12 of HLTs financial statements included in its Form 10Q filing 
for the quarterly period ending September 30, 2016.
 
  	 	  	In the fourth quarter of 2015, certain of HLTs U.S. subsidiary 
corporations were converted to limited liability companies and certain of 
HLTs subsidiary controlled foreign corporations elected to be disregarded 
for U.S. federal income tax purposes. These transactions were treated as 
tax-free liquidations for federal tax purposes.
