    thereto.  Without limiting the foregoing, and notwithstanding anything
    else contained herein to the contrary, Knight may not make, grant,
    enter into or otherwise commit to any sublicense of its rights granted
    hereunder, including to any Affiliate, prior to the NDA Transfer Date
    without the prior written consent of Braeburn.  All sublicense
    agreements, distribution or other arrangements or agreements shall be

    Agreement and the Titan Agreement, and any sublicensees, distributors
    or other party shall be bound by the terms and conditions of this

    full responsibility for any actions taken or any failures to act by any
    sublicensee, distributor or other person and any of the expenses,
    costs, or fees incurred by any sublicensee, distributor or other
    person.  In the event Knight grants a sublicense to an Affiliate, any

    full amount by Braeburn in the United States, and in United States
    Dollars, without any tax withholding or tax deduction therefrom, except
    as provided under Section 13.1.

    2.6                               Restriction on Knight Sales.  Knight
    shall not, either directly or indirectly (including through any
    Affiliate, representative, agent or sublicensee) knowingly: (i) sell or

    knowingly distribute any Sublicensed Products for sale or use outside

    offered to distribute Sublicensed Products outside the Territory after
    Knight has knowledge that said Third Party has distributed or offered
    to distribute Sublicensed Products outside the Territory.  If Knight
    knows or has reason to suspect that a Third Party to whom Knight sells
    or otherwise disposes of Sublicensed Products is engaged in the sale or
    distribution of Sublicensed Products for use outside the Territory,
    then Knight shall (A) within [***] Business Days after gaining
    knowledge of, or reason to suspect, such activities notify Braeburn
    thereof and provide all information in Knights possession that
    Braeburn may reasonably request concerning such activities, and (B)
    take all reasonable steps (including cessation of sales, directly or
    indirectly, to such Third Party) necessary to limit such sale or other
    disposition for use outside the Territory.  All inquiries or orders
    received by Knight for Sublicensed Product to be delivered outside the
    Territory shall be referred to

        Term, Braeburn or any of its Affiliates intends to license or
        sublicense its right to develop or Commercialize a ROFN Product in
        the Territory (or any part thereof) to any Third Party in order to
        permit such Third Party to develop or Commercialize the ROFN

        Braeburn shall first notify Knight of its intent, provide to Knight
        a copy of material data with respect to the development and
        commercialization of such ROFN Product in Braeburns possession and
        Control not previously provided to Knight and that shall be
        reasonably sufficient to assess the ROFN Product (the Data Package
        ), and shall, unless Knight notifies Braeburn in writing during
        the ROFN Negotiation Period that it is not interested in acquiring
        rights to a particular ROFN Product (a Knight Waiver Notice),
        negotiate solely and in good faith with Knight for [***]) with
        respect to mutually agreeable binding financial terms (Binding

        authority and responsibility and shall use Commercially Reasonable
        Efforts to develop, modify, seek and/or obtain any necessary

        materials used in connection with Sublicensed Products in the

        reasonably believes that a filing or submission relating to
        Sublicensed Products in the Territory is required by Applicable
        Laws in order to sell or continue selling the Sublicensed Products,
        Braeburn shall notify Knight in writing.  If Knight decides not to
        prepare such filing or submission, it shall promptly notify
        Braeburn of such decision and Braeburn shall, acting reasonably, be
        entitled to prepare such filing or submission, [***], to be filed

    Trademarks and shall share with the other Party all information
    available to it regarding such infringement.  Braeburn shall have the
    first right to determine in its discretion whether to and to what
    extent to institute, prosecute and/or defend any action or proceedings
    involving or affecting any rights relating to the Braeburn Marks and
    Sublicensed Product Trademarks in the Territory.  Upon Braeburns
    reasonable request, Knight shall cooperate with and assist Braeburn in

    recalculated to reflect an amount equal to [***].  In the event there
    are greater-than-anticipated cost increases for the manufacture of
    Sublicensed Products, Braeburn will be entitled to increase the Supply
    Price [***] (Supply Price Increase).
 
    6.3                               Reports and Payments.
 
        (a)                                 Within [***] calendar days
        after the end of each Calendar Quarter following Launch that begins
        or ends during the Term, Knight shall furnish to Braeburn a written
        report (each, a Royalty Report) showing:
 
            (i)                                     all Net Sales during

        (b)                                 Each such Royalty Report shall

        (c)                                  Within [***] days after the
        Calendar Quarter during which this Agreement terminates or expires

        final Royalty True-Up with respect to such Calendar Quarter (the 
        Final Royalty True-Up Report).  If the Final Royalty True-Up
        Report indicates that additional Royalties are payable with respect
        to the Final Royalty Period, such Final Royalty True-Up Report
        shall be accompanied by payment of such additional Royalties.  If
        the Final Royalty True-Up Report indicates that Royalties were
        overpaid with respect to the Final Royalty Period, Braeburn shall
        pay to Knight an amount equal to such overpayment within [***] days
        following the delivery of the Final Royalty True-Up to Braeburn. 
        If Braeburn disagrees with the Final Royalty True-Up Report,

        complete and accurate records in connection with the purchase, use
        and/or sale by or for it of Sublicensed Products hereunder in

            reasonably acceptable to the Knight, to have access during
            normal business hours to the records of Knight as may be
            reasonably necessary to verify any payment made or due
            hereunder and the accuracy of the reports, including the

            Calendar Years (or any portion thereof) ending not more than

            effect of such calculations on the amounts payable by Knight
            under this Agreement), but no other information shall be

    During the Term, Knight agrees to obtain exclusively from Braeburn all
    Knights requirements of the Sublicensed Products for the Territory at
    the Supply Price and otherwise on the terms and subject to the
    conditions of a manufacturing and supply agreement in customary form

    Parties following the Effective Date (the Supply Agreement);
    provided, that the Parties shall negotiate in good faith and use
    Commercially Reasonable Efforts to execute and deliver the Supply

    Supply Agreement, Braeburn agrees to supply Knight with all of its
    requirements of Sublicensed Products for Commercialization in the
    Territory during the Term.  For the avoidance of doubt, Braeburn may,
    at its discretion, use the services of a Third Party to manufacture
    and/or package some or all of the Sublicensed Products supplied to
    Knight under the Supply Agreement.

    Knight in a timely manner of Braeburns intention and reason therefore
    and providing Knight with reasonable opportunity to comment upon such

    a course of action, including the commencement of legal action by any
    Party.

    .
 
        (a)                                 Braeburn shall have the first

        Braeburn Mark or of any unfair trade practices, trade dress
        imitation, passing off of counterfeit goods, or like offenses in
        the Territory relating to the Sublicensed Products.  If Braeburn
        elects to respond to any actual or threatened infringement by
        initiating a proceeding, Braeburn shall use legal counsel of its
        choice at its expense and shall have full control over the conduct
        of such proceeding, including whether to initiate any legal
        proceeding and/or the settlement thereof.  Braeburn may settle or
        compromise any such proceeding without the consent of Knight;
        provided, however, that if such settlement adversely affects
        Knights rights under this Agreement, or Knights ability to
        Commercialize the Sublicensed Products within the Territory, or
        otherwise requires Knight to admit wrongdoing, fault, or liability,
        Braeburn will not settle or compromise any such proceeding without
        the consent of Knight, such consent not to be unreasonably
        withheld, conditioned or delayed.
 
        (b)                                 If, within a period of [***]
        days after the first notice of infringement is provided under
        Section 8.4, Braeburn elects not to initiate and respond to any
        actual or threatened infringement of a Braeburn Patent, a Braeburn
        Mark or of any unfair trade practices, trade dress imitation,
        passing off of counterfeit goods, or like offenses in the Territory
        relating to the Sublicensed Products, then Knight shall have the
        right, but not the obligation, to take action, at its sole expense
        and to the extent permitted under the Titan Agreement, in which
        case Knight shall have full control over the conduct of such

    10.1                        Non-Disclosure and Non-Use Obligations. 
    All Confidential Information disclosed by one Party to the other Party
    hereunder shall be maintained in confidence and shall not be disclosed
    to any Third Party or used for any purpose except as expressly
    permitted herein without the prior written consent of the Party that
    disclosed the Confidential Information to the other Party during the
    Term and for a period of [***] years thereafter.  For purposes of this
    Agreement, Confidential Information means any and all Know-How,
    scientific, clinical, regulatory, marketing, financial, technical,
    non-technical, commercial or other confidential information or data of
    a confidential nature, whether communicated in writing, orally or by
    any other means, that is under the protection of one Party and is
    provided by that Party to the other Party in connection with this
    Agreement.  The foregoing non-disclosure and non-use obligations shall
    not apply to the extent that such Proprietary Information:
 
        (a)                                 is known by the receiving Party
        at the time of its receipt, and not through a prior disclosure by
        the disclosing Party, as documented by business records;
 
        (b)                                 is or becomes properly in the
        public domain or knowledge without breach by either Party;

        (c)                                  is subsequently disclosed to a
        receiving Party by a Third Party who, to the knowledge of the
        receiving Party, is lawfully able do so and, to the knowledge of
        the receiving Party, is not under an obligation of confidentiality
        to the disclosing Party; or
 
        (d)                                 is developed by the receiving
        Party independently of Confidential Information received from the
        other Party, as documented by research and development records.
 
    10.2                        Permitted Disclosure of Proprietary
    Information.  Notwithstanding Section 10.1, a Party receiving
    Confidential Information of another Party may disclose such
    Confidential Information:
 
        (a)                                 to governmental or other
        regulatory agencies as required by Applicable Law, in order to file
        Regulatory Submissions, but such disclosure may be made only to the
        extent reasonably necessary to file such Regulatory Submissions and
        in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement or as
        otherwise requested by the relevant Governmental Authority;
 
        (b)                                 in connection with the
        performance of this Agreement and solely on a need-to-know basis,
        to Affiliates; potential or actual collaborators (including
        potential sublicensees); potential or actual investment bankers,
        accountants, investors, lenders, or acquirers; or employees,
        independent contractors (including consultants and clinical
        investigators) or agents, each of whom prior to disclosure must be
        bound by written obligations of confidentiality and non-use no less
        restrictive than the obligations set forth in this Article 10 or to
        counsel for such Party; provided, however, that the receiving Party
        shall (i) undertake reasonable precautions to safeguard and protect
        the confidentiality of the Confidential Information; (ii) remain
        responsible for any failure by any person who receives Confidential
        Information pursuant to this Article 10 to treat such Confidential
        Information as required under this Article 10; and (iii) take all
        reasonable measures to restrain the receiving Party and any such
        persons from prohibited or unauthorized disclosure or use in
        violation of this Article 10;
 
        (c)                                  if required to be disclosed by
        Applicable Law or court order, provided that notice is promptly
        delivered to the non-disclosing Party in order to provide an
        opportunity to challenge or limit the disclosure obligations; or
 
        (d)                                 with respect to Braeburn, to
        Titan to the extent required by Braeburn to exercise its rights or
        perform its obligations under the Titan Agreement.
 
    If and whenever any Confidential Information is disclosed in accordance
    with this Section 10.2, such disclosure shall not cause any such
    information to cease to be Confidential Information except to the
    extent that such disclosure results in a public disclosure of such
    information (other than in breach of this Agreement). Where

    reasonably possible and subject to Section 10.3, the receiving Party
    shall notify the disclosing Party of the receiving Partys intent to
    make such disclosure pursuant to Sections 10.2(a)-(c) sufficiently
    prior to making such disclosure so as to allow the disclosing Party
    adequate time to take whatever action it may deem appropriate to
    protect the confidentiality of the information, and the receiving Party
    shall cooperate with the disclosing Party in such efforts.
 
    10.3                        Disclosure of Agreement to Governmental
    Authority.  Without limiting any of the foregoing, it is understood
    that the Parties or their Affiliates may make disclosure of this
    Agreement and the terms hereof in any filings required by a
    Governmental Authority or securities exchange, may file this Agreement
    as an exhibit to any filing with such Governmental Authority or
    securities exchange, and may distribute any such filing in the ordinary
    course of its business; provided however, that the Party seeking such
    disclosure first provides the other Party a copy of the proposed
    disclosure, and provided further that (except to the extent that the
    Party seeking disclosure is required to disclose such information to
    comply with Applicable Law) if the other Party demonstrates to the
    reasonable satisfaction of the Party seeking disclosure, within [***]
    Business Days of such Partys providing the copy, that the public
    disclosure of previously undisclosed information will materially
    adversely affect the development and/or commercialization of a
    Sublicensed Product, the Party seeking disclosure will remove from the
    disclosure such specific previously undisclosed information as the
    other Party shall reasonably request to be removed, or otherwise
    provide a good faith reason to the other Party why such disclosure was
    not removed.
 
    10.4                        Other Public Statements.  Except as set
    forth in this Agreement or as required by Applicable Law, neither Party
    shall make any press release or other public announcement or other
    disclosure to a Third Party concerning the existence or terms of this
    Agreement or relating to Sublicensed Products without the prior written
    consent of the other Party, which consent shall include agreement upon
    the nature and text of such announcement or disclosure and shall not be
    unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.  Each Party agrees to
    provide to the other Party a copy of any public announcement as soon as
    reasonably practicable under the circumstances prior to its scheduled
    release.  Each Party shall have the right to expeditiously [***] review
    and recommend changes to any press release or announcement regarding
    this Agreement or the subject matter of this Agreement; provided,
    however that such right of review and recommendation shall only apply
    for the first time that specific information is to be disclosed, and
    shall not apply to the subsequent disclosure of substantially similar
    information that has previously been disclosed unless there have been
    material developments relating to Sublicensed Products since the date
    of the previous disclosure.
 
    10.5                        No Rights to Use Name of Other Party. 
    Except as provided herein, neither Party shall use the name, trademark,
    trade name or logo of the other Party in any publicity, promotion, news
    release or disclosure relating to this Agreement or its subject matter,

    11.                               TERM AND TERMINATION
 
    11.1                        Term.  Except as expressly provided in
    Section 2.1, and unless earlier terminated pursuant to Section 11.2(a),
    this Agreement will take effect on the Effective Date and, unless
    earlier terminated in accordance with the terms herein, will continue
    in full force and effect for fifteen (15) years from the date of Launch
    of the Initial Indication (from the Effective Date until the fifteenth
    (15th) anniversary of the date of Launch of the Initial Indication,
    unless earlier terminated, the Initial Term); provided, that if a
    Subsequent Indication for the Sublicensed Product received Regulatory
    Approval in the Territory on or after the fifth (5th) anniversary of
    the Launch of the Initial Indication, the Parties shall negotiate in
    good faith with respect to an appropriate extension of the Initial
    Term.  Any such extension shall be mutually agreed in writing.  Upon
    the expiration of the Initial Term and any subsequent Term thereafter,
    this Agreement shall automatically renew for successive two (2) year
    periods (each a Renewal Term) unless, at least one hundred eighty
    (180) days prior to the scheduled expiry of the Initial Term or Renewal
    Term, either Party provides the other with written notice of its
    intention not to renew the Agreement (a Non-Renewal Notice), in which
    case this Agreement shall expire at the end of the applicable period.
 
    11.2                        Early Termination.  This Agreement may be
    terminated as follows:
 
        (a)                                 If the NDA Transfer Date has
        not occurred within six (6) months of the Effective Date, either
        Party may provide written notice of an intent to terminate this
        Agreement, provided that if a Party intends to terminate the
        Agreement, such Party shall first discuss in good faith the reasons
        for seeking termination and considers potential alternatives to
        termination, including potential amendments to the Agreement. 
        Termination under this Section 11.2(a) shall not effective be
        sooner than thirty (30) days from the date of notice.
 
        (b)                                 Either Party may, without
        prejudice to any other remedies available to it under this
        Agreement or at Applicable Law or in equity:
 
            (i)                                     immediately terminate
            this Agreement upon the filing or institution of bankruptcy,
            reorganization, liquidation or receivership proceedings, or
            upon an assignment of a substantial portion of the assets for
            the benefit of creditors by the other Party; provided, however,
            in the case of any involuntary bankruptcy, reorganization,
            liquidation, receivership or assignment proceeding such right
            to terminate shall only become effective if such other Party
            consents to the involuntary proceeding or such proceeding is
            not dismissed within sixty (60) days after the filing thereof;
            or

            (ii)                                  terminate this Agreement
            prior to expiration of the Term in the event the other Party is
            in material default or breach of the performance of its
            obligations hereunder, and has not cured such breach within (i)
            thirty (30) days after written notice thereof provided by the
            non-breaching Party to the breaching Party, in case such breach
            is a non-payment of any amount due under this Agreement (which
            shall be deemed a material breach) and (ii) sixty (60) days
            after written notice thereof provided by the non-breaching
            Party to the breaching Party for other cases of breach.  The
            termination shall become effective at the end of the (x) thirty
            (30) day period in case the breach is a non-payment of any
            amount due under this Agreement if the breaching Party has not
            cured such breach during such thirty (30) day period, or (y)
            sixty (60) day period for other cases of breach unless the
            breaching Party cures such breach during such sixty (60) day
            period.  The right of either Braeburn or Knight to terminate
            this Agreement as provided in this Section 11.2 shall not be
            affected in any way by such Partys waiver or failure to take
            action with respect to any previous breach or default.
 
        (c)                                  Braeburn may, without
        prejudice to any other remedies available to it under this
        Agreement or at Applicable Law or in equity, terminate this
        Agreement:
 
            (i)                                     on thirty (30) days
            written notice to Knight, if Knight, following Launch,
            discontinues commercial sale of Sublicensed Product for a
            period of three (3) months or more for reasons unrelated to
            Force Majeure, regulatory or safety issues or supply or
            manufacturing or Sublicensed Product quality issues and
            subsequently fails to resume sales of a Product within thirty
            (30) days of having been notified in writing of such failure by
            Braeburn;
 
            (ii)                                  upon written notice to
            Knight in the event Knight or any of its Affiliates or
            sublicensees commences any legal proceeding seeking to
            challenge or otherwise dispute the validity or ownership of any
            of the Braeburn Patents or any of the claims therein, or
            knowingly assists any Third Party to do any of the foregoing,
            which termination shall be effective on the date set forth in
            such notice; or
 
            (iii)                               If Braeburn determines, in
            its sole discretion, that it is in its best interests to
            terminate the Titan Agreement pursuant to any one of Sections
            12.2(c)(i), 12.2(c)(iii), and 12.2(c)(iv) of the Titan
            Agreement, then Braeburn shall provide Knight with at least
            ninety (90) days prior notice and, during such ninety-day
            (90-day) period, Braeburn shall discuss with Knight, in good
            faith, whether the grounds upon which Braeburn judges
            termination to be in its best interests can be adequately
            mitigated.  If, after discussions with Knight, Braeburn still
            decides it is in Braeburns best interests to terminate the
            Titan Agreement, then Braeburn shall negotiate

            in good faith with Titan and Knight to determine whether Titan
            would agree to license rights in the Territory directly to
            Knight, including a commitment to supply Sublicensed Products
            to Knight.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Braeburn may not
            terminate this Agreement under this Section 11.2(c)(iii) prior
            to three (3) years following the NDA Transfer date and then
            only upon at least one (1) year prior notice.  If Braeburn
            terminates the Titan agreement pursuant to this Section
            11.2(c)(iii), then, notwithstanding the termination of this
            Agreement, the ROFN outlined in Section 2.9 shall survive for
            the remainder of the Initial Term.
 
        (d)                                 Either Party may, without
        prejudice to any other remedies available to it under this
        Agreement or at Applicable Law or in equity, terminate this
        Agreement immediately upon written notice to the other Party, if
        either Party determines in good faith that it is not advisable for
        Knight to continue to Commercialize any Sublicensed Products in the
        Territory as a result of a bona fide safety issue regarding any
        Sublicensed Products.
 
        (e)                                  This Agreement shall
        automatically terminate in the event the Titan Agreement is
        terminated prior to the expiration of the Term; provided that
        Braeburn shall not seek to terminate the Titan Agreement for any
        reason other than what is contemplated in Section 11.2(c) hereof,
        or Section 12.2(a) of the Titan Agreement.
 
    11.3                        Effect of Termination.  Upon expiry or
    termination of this Agreement, all sublicenses and rights granted by
    Braeburn hereunder shall terminate and:
 
        (a)                                 Knight undertakes to:
 
            (i)                                     except as provided for
            in Section 11.5, cease any Commercialization of Sublicensed
            Products in the Territory;
 
            (ii)                                  commence, within thirty
            (30) days of expiry or termination, and complete as promptly as
            practicable, the transfer of title to all current and pending
            Regulatory Submissions and Regulatory Approvals for the
            Sublicensed Products to Braeburn or its designee and assist

    12.                               DISPUTE RESOLUTION
 
    12.1                        Arbitration.  Except as otherwise expressly
    provided herein, any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to
    this Agreement, or to the breach, termination, or validity of this
    Agreement, will be resolved as follows: each Party shall discuss the
    matter and make reasonable efforts to attempt to resolve the dispute. 
    If the Parties are unable to resolve the dispute, the chief executive
    officer of each Party, or their designees, will meet within [***] days
    of a request to attempt to resolve such dispute being made by a Party. 
    If the chief executive officers, or their designees, cannot resolve the
    dispute through good faith negotiations within [***] days after a Party
    requests such meeting, then the Parties shall resort to binding
    arbitration before a single arbitrator, in New York, New York, using
    the arbitration procedures set forth under the laws of the State of New
    York.  The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and not subject to
    appeal and the arbitrator may apportion the costs of the arbitration,
    including the reasonable fees and disbursements of the Parties, between
    or among the Parties in such manner as the arbitrator considers
    reasonable.  All matters in relation to the arbitration shall be kept
    confidential to the full extent permitted

PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED.
 
    by law, and no individual shall be appointed as an arbitrator unless he
    or she agrees in writing to be bound by this provision.
 
    12.2                        Irreparable Harm.  Notwithstanding anything
    to the contrary in Section 12.1, if either Party in its sole judgment,
    acting reasonably, believes that any such dispute could cause it
    irreparable harm, such Party will be entitled to seek temporary
    equitable relief from a court of competent jurisdiction in order to
    avoid such irreparable harm during the pendency of the procedure set
    forth in Section 12.1.  For the avoidance of any doubt, nothing in this
    Article 12 shall preclude, interfere with or modify either Partys
    rights under Article 11 above with respect to the termination of this
    Agreement.
 
    13.                               OTHER PROVISIONS
 
    13.1                        Withholding Tax.  Knight will make all
    payments to Braeburn under this Agreement without deduction or
    withholding for taxes except to the extent that any such deduction or
    withholding is required by Applicable Law in effect at the time of
    payment.  Any tax required to be withheld on amounts payable by Knight
    under this Agreement will be timely paid by Knight on behalf of
    Braeburn to the appropriate Governmental Authority, and Knight will
    furnish Braeburn with the corresponding proof of payment of such tax,
    as may be required in order to enable Braeburn to request reimbursement
    or deduction of the withheld amount, or to otherwise comply with its
    duties.  Knight and Braeburn agree to cooperate to legally minimize and
    reduce such withholding taxes and provide any information or
    documentation required by any taxing authority.
 
    13.2                        Further Assurances.  Upon request by either
    Party and at such Partys expense, the other Party shall do such
    further acts and execute such additional agreements and instruments as
    may be reasonably necessary to give effect to the purposes of this
    Agreement.
 
    13.3                        Independent Status.  Each Partys legal
    relationship under this Agreement to the other Party shall be that of
    independent contractor, and not partners or joint venturers.
 
    13.4                        Assignment.  This Agreement may not be,
    directly or indirectly, assigned or otherwise transferred, in whole or
    in part, by a Party to a Third Party without the prior written consent
    of the other Party; provided, however, that each Party may assign this
    Agreement to (a) any of its Affiliate or (b) in connection with its
    acquisition or the transfer or sale of all or substantially all of its
    assets or its business to which this Agreement relates, without such
    consent; provided, further, that the assigning Party shall promptly
    notify the other Party of any such assignment.  The rights and
    obligations contained herein shall inure to the benefit of each Partys
    successors and permitted assigns, and shall be binding on and
    enforceable against the relevant Partys successors and permitted
    assigns.  Any reference in this Agreement to any Party shall be
    construed accordingly. Any purported assignment not in accordance with
    this Agreement shall be void.

    comply with, and shall not be in violation of, any Applicable Laws.
 
    13.6                        Force Majeure.  No Party shall be
    responsible for a failure or delay in performance of any of the

    Reasonable Efforts to overcome the effect of the Force Majeure as soon
    as possible.  The other Party will have no right to demand indemnity
    for damage or assert a breach against such Party, provided, however,
    that if the event of Force Majeure preventing performance shall
    continue for more than [***] months and such underlying cause would not
    also prevent other parties from performing such obligations, then the
    Party not subject to the event of Force Majeure may terminate this
    Agreement with a written notice to the other without any liability
    hereunder, except the obligation to make payments due to such date and
    any obligations surviving under Section 11.4.
