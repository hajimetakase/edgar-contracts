and subject to the limitations on exercise and the conditions hereinafter 
set forth, at any time on or after the Issue Date (the “Initial Exercise 
Date”) and on or prior to 6:00 p.m. eastern time on August 15, 2008 (the “
Termination Date”) but not thereafter, to subscribe for and purchase from 
Advanced Battery Technologies, a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), up 
to ______ Units each such Unit consisting of one share of Common Stock (the 
“Warrant Shares”) and 0.45 Series A Common Stock Purchase Warrants, which 
such Series A Warrant shall have an exercise price equal to the higher of 
$5.51 or the closing bid price on the Trading Market on the Trading Day 
immediately prior to the date of exercise of this Warrant.  The purchase 
price of one Unit shall be equal to the Exercise Price, as defined in 
Section 2(b).

Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”), dated August 11, 2008, among 
the Company and the purchasers signatory thereto.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
Section 2.       Exercise.
 
    a)       Exercise of Warrant.  Exercise of the purchase rights
    represented by this Warrant may be made, in whole or in part, at any
    time or times on or after the Initial Exercise Date and on or before
    the Termination Date, by delivery to the Company (or such other office
    or agency of the Company as it may designate by notice in writing to
    the registered Holder at the address of the Holder appearing on the
    books of the Company) of a duly executed facsimile copy of the Notice
    of Exercise Form annexed hereto; and, within 3 Trading Days of the date
    said Notice of Exercise is delivered to the Company, the Company shall
    have received  payment of the aggregate Exercise Price of the shares
    thereby purchased by wire transfer or cashier’s check drawn on a United
    States bank.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the
    Holder shall not be required to physically surrender this Warrant to
    the Company until the Holder has purchased all of the Units available
    hereunder and the Warrant has been exercised in full, in which case,
    the Holder shall surrender this Warrant to the Company for cancellation
    within 3 Trading Days of the date the final Notice of Exercise is
    delivered to the Company.  Partial exercises of this Warrant resulting
    in purchases of a portion of the total number of Units available
    hereunder shall have the effect of lowering the outstanding number of
    Units purchasable hereunder in an amount equal to the applicable number
    of Units purchased.  The Holder and the Company shall maintain records
    showing the number of Units purchased and the date of such purchases. 
    The Company shall deliver any objection to any Notice of Exercise Form
    within 1 Business Day of receipt of such notice.  In the event of any
    dispute or discrepancy, the records of the Holder shall be controlling
    and determinative in the absence of manifest error. The Holder and any
    assignee, by acceptance of this Warrant, acknowledge and agree that, by
    reason of the provisions of this paragraph, following the purchase of a
    portion of the Units hereunder, the number of Units available for
    purchase hereunder at any given time may be less than the amount stated
    on the face hereof.
 
    b)       Exercise Price.  The exercise price per Unit under this
    Warrant shall be $4.25, subject to adjustment hereunder (the “Exercise
    Price”).
 
    c)       Holder’s Restrictions.  The Company shall not effect any
    exercise of this Warrant, and a Holder shall not have the right to
    exercise any portion of this Warrant, pursuant to Section 2 or
    otherwise, to the extent that after giving effect to such issuance
    after exercise as set forth on the applicable Notice of Exercise, the
    Holder (together with the Holder’s Affiliates, and any other person or
    entity acting as a group together with the Holder or any of the
    Holder’s Affiliates), would beneficially own in excess of the
    Beneficial Ownership Limitation (as defined below).  For purposes of
    the foregoing sentence, the number of shares of Common Stock
    beneficially owned by the Holder and its Affiliates shall include the
    number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of this Warrant
    with respect to which such determination is being made, but shall
    exclude the number of shares of Common Stock which would be issuable
    upon
 

 
2
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
    (A) exercise of the remaining, nonexercised portion of this Warrant
    beneficially owned by the Holder or any of its Affiliates and (B)
    exercise or conversion of the unexercised or nonconverted portion of
    any other securities of the Company (including, without limitation, any
    other  Common Stock Equivalents) subject to a limitation on conversion
    or exercise analogous to the limitation contained herein beneficially
    owned by the Holder or any of its affiliates.  Except as set forth in
    the preceding sentence, for purposes of this Section 2(c), beneficial
    ownership shall be calculated in accordance with Section 13(d) of the
    Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, it
    being acknowledged by the Holder that the Company is not representing
    to the Holder that such calculation is in compliance with Section 13(d)
    of the Exchange Act and the Holder is solely responsible for any
    schedules required to be filed in accordance therewith.   To the extent
    that the limitation contained in this Section 2(c) applies, the
    determination of whether this Warrant is exercisable (in relation to
    other securities owned by the Holder together with any Affiliates) and
    of which portion of this Warrant is exercisable shall be in the sole
    discretion of the Holder, and the submission of a Notice of Exercise
    shall be deemed to be the Holder’s determination of whether this
    Warrant is exercisable (in relation to other securities owned by the
    Holder together with any Affiliates) and of which portion of this
    Warrant is exercisable, in each case subject to the Beneficial
    Ownership Limitation, and the Company shall have no obligation to
    verify or confirm the accuracy of such determination.   In addition, a
    determination as to any group status as contemplated above shall be
    determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the
    rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.  For purposes of this
    Section 2(c), in determining the number of outstanding shares of Common
    Stock, a Holder may rely on the number of outstanding shares of Common
    Stock as reflected in (A) the Company’s most recent periodic or annual
    report, as the case may be, (B) a more recent public announcement by
    the Company or (C) any other notice by the Company or the Transfer
    Agent setting forth the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding. 
    Upon the written or oral request of a Holder, the Company shall within
    two Trading Days confirm orally and in writing to the Holder the number
    of shares of Common Stock then outstanding.  In any case, the number of
    outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be determined after giving
    effect to the conversion or exercise of securities of the Company,
    including this Warrant, by the Holder or its Affiliates since the date
    as of which such number of outstanding shares of Common Stock was
    reported.  The “Beneficial Ownership Limitation” shall be 4.99% of the
    number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding immediately after
    giving effect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock issuable upon
    exercise of this Warrant.  The Holder, upon not less than 61 days’
    prior notice to the Company, may increase or decrease the Beneficial
    Ownership Limitation provisions of this Section 2(c), provided that the
    Beneficial Ownership Limitation in no event exceeds 9.99% of the number
    of shares of the Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving
    effect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock upon exercise of this
    Warrant held by the Holder and the provisions of this Section 2(d)
    shall continue to apply.  Any such increase or decrease will not be
    effective until the 61st day after such notice is delivered to the
    Company.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
     The provisions of this paragraph shall be construed and implemented in
    a manner otherwise than in strict conformity with the terms of this
    Section 2(c) to correct this paragraph (or any portion hereof) which
    may be defective or inconsistent with the intended Beneficial Ownership
    Limitation herein contained or to make changes or supplements necessary
    or desirable to properly give effect to such limitation. The
    limitations contained in this paragraph shall apply to a successor
    holder of this Warrant.
 
    d)       Mechanics of Exercise.
 
           i.       Delivery of Certificates Upon Exercise.  Certificates
           for Warrant Shares and Series A Warrants purchased hereunder
           shall be delivered to the address specified by the Holder in the
           Notice of Exercise within 3 Trading Days from the delivery to
           the Company of the Notice of Exercise Form, surrender of this
           Warrant (if required) and payment of the aggregate Exercise
           Price as set forth above (the “Unit Delivery Date”).  This
           Warrant shall be deemed to have been exercised on the date the
           Exercise Price is received by the Company.  The Units shall be
           deemed to have been issued, and Holder or any other person so
           designated to be named therein shall be deemed to have become a
           holder of record of such Units for all purposes, as of the date
           the Warrant has been exercised by payment to the Company of the
           Exercise Price and all taxes required to be paid by the Holder,
           if any, pursuant to Section 2(e)(vi) prior to the issuance of
           such shares, have been paid.
 
           ii.      Delivery of New Warrants Upon Exercise.  If this
           Warrant shall have been exercised in part, the Company shall, at
           the request of a Holder and upon surrender of this Warrant
           certificate, at the time of delivery of the certificate or
           certificates representing Units, deliver to Holder a new Warrant
           evidencing the rights of Holder to purchase the unpurchased
           Units called for by this Warrant, which new Warrant shall in all
           other respects be identical with this Warrant.
 
           iii.     Rescission Rights.  If the Company fails to deliver to
           the Holder a certificate or the certificates representing the
           Units pursuant to Section 2(e)(i) by the Warrant Share Delivery
           Date, then, the Holder will have the right to rescind such
           exercise.
4
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
           iv.     Compensation for Buy-In on Failure to Timely Deliver
           Certificates Upon Exercise.  In addition to any other rights
           available to the Holder, if the Company fails to deliver to the
           Holder a certificate or the certificates representing the Units
           pursuant to an exercise on or before the Unit Delivery Date, and
           if after such date the Holder is required by its broker to
           purchase (in an open market transaction or otherwise) or the
           Holder’s brokerage firm otherwise purchases, shares of Common
           Stock to deliver in satisfaction of a sale by the Holder of the
           Shares which the Holder anticipated receiving upon such exercise
           (a “Buy-In”), then the Company shall (A) pay in cash to the
           Holder the amount by which (x) the Holder’s total purchase price
           (including brokerage commissions, if any) for the shares of
           Common Stock so purchased exceeds (y) the amount obtained by
           multiplying (1) the number of Shares that the Company was
           required to deliver to the Holder in connection with the
           exercise at issue times (2) the price at which the sell order
           giving rise to such purchase obligation was executed, and (B) at
           the option of the Holder, either reinstate the portion of the
           Warrant and equivalent number of Shares for which such exercise
           was not honored or deliver to the Holder the number of shares of
           Common Stock that would have been issued had the Company timely
           complied with its exercise and delivery obligations hereunder. 
           For example, if the Holder purchases Common Stock having a total
           purchase price of $11,000 to cover a Buy-In with respect to an
           attempted exercise of shares of Common Stock with an aggregate
           sale price giving rise to such purchase obligation of $10,000,
           under clause (A) of the immediately preceding sentence the
           Company shall be required to pay the Holder $1,000. The Holder
           shall provide the Company written notice indicating the amounts
           payable to the Holder in respect of the Buy-In and, upon request
           of the Company, evidence of the amount of such loss.  Nothing
           herein shall limit a Holder’s right to pursue any other remedies
           available to it hereunder, at law or in equity including,
           without limitation, a decree of specific performance and/or
           injunctive relief with respect to the Company’s failure to
           timely deliver certificates representing shares of Common Stock
           and Series A Warrants upon exercise of the Warrant as required
           pursuant to the terms hereof.
 
           v.      No Fractional Units or Scrip.  No fractional Units or
           scrip representing fractional shares shall be issued upon the
           exercise of this Warrant.  As to any fraction of a Unit which
           Holder would otherwise be entitled to purchase upon such
           exercise, the Company shall, at its election, either pay a cash
           adjustment in respect of such final fraction in an amount equal
           to such fraction multiplied by the Exercise Price or round up to
           the next whole Unit.
 

 
5
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
           vi.     Charges, Taxes and Expenses.  Issuance of certificates
           for Units shall be made without charge to the Holder for any
           issue or transfer tax or other incidental expense in respect of
           the issuance of such certificate, all of which taxes and
           expenses shall be paid by the Company, and such certificates
           shall be issued in the name of the Holder or in such name or
           names as may be directed by the Holder; provided, however, that
           in the event certificates for Units are to be issued in a name
           other than the name of the Holder, this Warrant when surrendered
           for exercise shall be accompanied by the Assignment Form
           attached hereto duly executed by the Holder and the Company may
           require, as a condition thereto, the payment of a sum sufficient
           to reimburse it for any transfer tax incidental thereto.
 
           vii.    Closing of Books.  The Company will not close its
           stockholder books or records in any manner which prevents the
           timely exercise of this Warrant, pursuant to the terms hereof.
 
Section 3.       Certain Adjustments.
 
    a)       Stock Dividends and Splits. If the Company, at any time while
    this Warrant is outstanding: (i) pays a stock dividend or otherwise
    make a distribution or distributions on shares of its Common Stock or
    any other equity or equity equivalent securities payable in shares of
    Common Stock (which, for avoidance of doubt, shall not include any
    shares of Common Stock issued by the Company upon exercise of this
    Warrant), (ii) subdivides outstanding shares of Common Stock into a
    larger number of shares, (iii) combines (including by way of reverse
    stock split) outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number
    of shares or (iv) issues by reclassification of shares of the Common
    Stock any shares of capital stock of the Company, then in each case the
    Exercise Price shall be multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator
    shall be the number of shares of Common Stock (excluding treasury
    shares, if any) outstanding immediately before such event and of which
    the denominator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock
    outstanding immediately after such event and the number of Units
    issuable upon exercise of this Warrant shall be proportionately
    adjusted such that the aggregate Exercise Price of this Warrant shall
    remain unchanged.  Any adjustment made pursuant to this Section 3(a)
    shall become effective immediately after the record date for the
    determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or
    distribution and shall become effective immediately after the effective
    date in the case of a subdivision, combination or re-classification.
 
    b)       Intentionally Omitted.
 

 
6
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
    c)       Calculations. All calculations under this Section 3 shall be
    made to the nearest cent or the nearest 1/100th of a share, as the case
    may be. For purposes of this Section 3, the number of shares of Common
    Stock deemed to be issued and outstanding as of a given date shall be
    the sum of the number of shares of Common Stock (excluding treasury
    shares, if any) issued and outstanding.
 
    d)       Notice to Holder.
 
           i.       Adjustment to Exercise Price. Whenever the Exercise
           Price is adjusted pursuant to any provision of this Section 3,
           the Company shall promptly mail to the Holder a notice setting
           forth the Exercise Price after such adjustment and setting forth
           a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment.
 
           ii.      Notice to Allow Exercise by Holder. If (A) the Company
           shall declare a dividend (or any other distribution in whatever
           form) on the Common Stock, (B) the Company shall declare a
           special nonrecurring cash dividend on or a redemption of the
           Common Stock, (C) the Company shall authorize the granting to
           all holders of the Common Stock rights or warrants to subscribe
           for or purchase any shares of capital stock of any class or of
           any rights, (D) the approval of any stockholders of the Company
           shall be required in connection with any reclassification of the
           Common Stock, any consolidation or merger to which the Company
           is a party, any sale or transfer of all or substantially all of
           the assets of the Company, of any compulsory share exchange
           whereby the Common Stock is converted into other securities,
           cash or property, or (E) the Company shall authorize the
           voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up
           of the affairs of the Company, then, in each case, the Company
           shall cause to be mailed to the Holder at its last address as it
           shall appear upon the Warrant Register of the Company, at least
           5 calendar days prior to the applicable record or effective date
           hereinafter specified, a notice stating (x) the date on which a
           record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend,
           distribution, redemption, rights or warrants, or if a record is
           not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of the Common
           Stock of record to be entitled to such dividend, distributions,
           redemption, rights or warrants are to be determined or (y) the
           date on which such reclassification, consolidation, merger,
           sale, transfer or share exchange is expected to become effective
           or close, and the date as of which it is expected that holders
           of the Common Stock of record shall be entitled to exchange
           their shares of the Common Stock for securities, cash or other
           property deliverable upon such reclassification, consolidation,
           merger, sale, transfer or share exchange; provided that the
           failure to mail such notice or any defect therein or in the
           mailing thereof shall not affect the validity of the corporate
           action required to be specified in such notice.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
           The Holder is entitled to exercise this Warrant during the
           period commencing on the date of such notice to the effective
           date of the event triggering such notice.
 
Section 4.       Transfer of Warrant.
 
    a)       Transferability.  Subject to compliance with any applicable
    securities laws and the conditions set forth in Section 4(d) hereof and
    to the provisions of Section 4.1 of the Purchase Agreement, this
    Warrant and all rights hereunder (including, without limitation, any
    registration rights) are transferable, in whole or in part, upon
    surrender of this Warrant at the principal office of the Company or its
    designated agent, together with a written assignment of this Warrant
    substantially in the form attached hereto duly executed by the Holder
    or its agent or attorney and funds sufficient to pay any transfer taxes
    payable upon the making of such transfer.  Upon such surrender and, if
    required, such payment, the Company shall execute and deliver a new
    Warrant or Warrants in the name of the assignee or assignees, as
    applicable, and in the denomination or denominations specified in such
    instrument of assignment, and shall issue to the assignor a new Warrant
    evidencing the portion of this Warrant not so assigned, and this
    Warrant shall promptly be cancelled.  The Warrant, if properly
    assigned, may be exercised by a new holder for the purchase of Units
    without having a new Warrant issued.
 
    b)       New Warrants. This Warrant may be divided or combined with
    other Warrants upon presentation hereof at the aforesaid office of the
    Company, together with a written notice specifying the names and
    denominations in which new Warrants are to be issued, signed by the
    Holder or its agent or attorney.  Subject to compliance with Section
    4(a), as to any transfer which may be involved in such division or
    combination, the Company shall execute and deliver a new Warrant or
    Warrants in exchange for the Warrant or Warrants to be divided or
    combined in accordance with such notice. All Warrants issued on
    transfers or exchanges shall be dated the original Issue Date and shall
    be identical with this Warrant except as to the number of Units
    issuable pursuant thereto.
 
    c)       Warrant Register. The Company shall register this Warrant,
    upon records to be maintained by the Company for that purpose (the “
    Warrant Register”), in the name of the record Holder hereof from time
    to time.  The Company may deem and treat the registered Holder of this
    Warrant as the absolute owner hereof for the purpose of any exercise
    hereof or any distribution to the Holder, and for all other purposes,
    absent actual notice to the contrary.
 
    d)       Transfer Restrictions. If, at the time of the surrender of
    this Warrant in connection with any transfer of this Warrant, the
    transfer of this Warrant shall not be either (i) registered pursuant to
    an effective registration statement under the Securities Act and under
    applicable state securities or blue sky laws or (ii) eligible for
    resale without volume or manner-of-sale restrictions pursuant to Rule
    144, the Company may require, as a condition of allowing such transfer
    , that the Holder or transferee of this Warrant, as the case may be, 
    comply with the provisions of Section 5.7 of the Purchase Agreement.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
Section 5.       Miscellaneous.
 
    a)       No Rights as Stockholder Until Exercise.  This Warrant does
    not entitle the Holder to any voting rights or other rights as a
    stockholder of the Company prior to the exercise hereof as set forth in
    Section 2(e)(i).
 
    b)       Loss, Theft, Destruction or Mutilation of Warrant. The Company
    covenants that upon receipt by the Company of evidence reasonably
    satisfactory to it of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of
    this Warrant or any stock certificate relating to the Warrant Shares,
    and in case of loss, theft or destruction, of indemnity or security
    reasonably satisfactory to it (which, in the case of the Warrant, shall
    not include the posting of any bond), and upon surrender and
    cancellation of such Warrant or stock certificate, if mutilated, the
    Company will make and deliver a new Warrant or stock certificate of
    like tenor and dated as of such cancellation, in lieu of such Warrant
    or stock certificate.
 
    c)       Saturdays, Sundays, Holidays, etc.  If the last or appointed
    day for the taking of any action or the expiration of any right
    required or granted herein shall not be a Business Day, then, such
    action may be taken or such right may be exercised on the next
    succeeding Business Day.
 
    d)       Authorized Shares.
 
       The Company covenants that, during the period the Warrant is
       outstanding, it will reserve from its authorized and unissued Common
       Stock a sufficient number of shares to provide for the issuance of
       the Shares and Warrant Shares upon the exercise of any purchase
       rights under this Warrant.  The Company further covenants that its
       issuance of this Warrant shall constitute full authority to its
       officers who are charged with the duty of executing stock
       certificates to execute and issue the necessary certificates for the
       Shares, Series A Warrants and Warrant Shares upon the exercise of
       the purchase rights under this Warrant.  The Company will take all
       such reasonable action as may be necessary to assure that such
       Warrant Shares may be issued as provided herein without violation of
       any applicable law or regulation, or of any requirements of the
       Trading Market upon which the Common Stock may be listed.  The
       Company covenants that all Shares and Series A Warrants and Warrant
       Shares which may be issued upon the exercise of the purchase rights
       represented by this Warrant will, upon exercise of the purchase
       rights represented by this Warrant, be duly authorized, validly
       issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free from all taxes, liens
       and charges created by the Company in respect of the issue thereof
       (other than taxes in respect of any transfer occurring
       contemporaneously with such issue).

       Except and to the extent as waived or consented to by the Holder,
       the Company shall not by any action, including, without limitation,
       amending its certificate of incorporation or through any
       reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger,
       dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary
       action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any
       of the terms of this Warrant, but will at all times in good faith
       assist in the carrying out of all such terms and in the taking of
       all such actions as may be necessary or appropriate to protect the
       rights of Holder as set forth in this Warrant against impairment. 
       Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company will
       (i) not increase the par value of any Shares or Warrant Shares above
       the amount payable therefor upon such exercise immediately prior to
       such increase in par value, (ii) take all such action as may be
       necessary or appropriate in order that the Company may validly and
       legally issue fully paid and nonassessable Shares and Warrant Shares
       upon the exercise of this Warrant and (iii) use commercially
       reasonable efforts to obtain all such authorizations, exemptions or
       consents from any public regulatory body having jurisdiction
       thereof, as may be, necessary to enable the Company to perform its
       obligations under this Warrant.
 
       Before taking any action which would result in an adjustment in the
       number of Shares or Warrant Shares for which this Warrant is
       exercisable or in the Exercise Price, the Company shall obtain all
       such authorizations or exemptions thereof, or consents thereto, as
       may be necessary from any public regulatory body or bodies having
       jurisdiction thereof.
 
    e)       Jurisdiction. All questions concerning the construction,
    validity, enforcement and interpretation of this Warrant shall be
    determined in accordance with the provisions of the Purchase Agreement.
 
    f)        Restrictions.  The Holder acknowledges that the Shares,
    Series A Warrants and Warrant Shares acquired upon the exercise of this
    Warrant, if not registered, will have restrictions upon resale imposed
    by state and federal securities laws.
 
    g)       Nonwaiver and Expenses.  No course of dealing or any delay or
    failure to exercise any right hereunder on the part of Holder shall
    operate as a waiver of such right or otherwise prejudice Holder’s
    rights, powers or remedies, notwithstanding the fact that all rights
    hereunder terminate on the Termination Date.  If the Company willfully
    and knowingly fails to comply with any provision of this Warrant, which
    results in any material damages to the Holder, the Company shall pay to
    Holder such amounts as shall be sufficient to cover any costs and
    expenses including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys’ fees,
    including those of appellate proceedings, incurred by Holder in
    collecting any amounts due pursuant hereto or in otherwise enforcing
    any of its rights, powers or remedies hereunder.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
    h)       Notices.  Any notice, request or other document required or
    permitted to be given or delivered to the Holder by the Company shall
    be delivered in accordance with the notice provisions of the Purchase
    Agreement.
 
    i)        Limitation of Liability.  No provision hereof, in the absence
    of any affirmative action by Holder to exercise this Warrant to
    purchase Warrant Shares, and no enumeration herein of the rights or
    privileges of Holder, shall give rise to any liability of Holder for
    the purchase price of any Common Stock or as a stockholder of the
    Company, whether such liability is asserted by the Company or by
    creditors of the Company.
 
    j)        Remedies.  The Holder, in addition to being entitled to
    exercise all rights granted by law, including recovery of damages, will
    be entitled to specific performance of its rights under this Warrant. 
    The Company agrees that monetary damages would not be adequate
    compensation for any loss incurred by reason of a breach by it of the
    provisions of this Warrant and hereby agrees to waive and not to assert
    the defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law
    would be adequate.
 
    k)       Successors and Assigns.  Subject to applicable securities
    laws, this Warrant and the rights and obligations evidenced hereby
    shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the successors of the
    Company and the successors and permitted assigns of Holder.  The
    provisions of this Warrant are intended to be for the benefit of all
    Holders from time to time of this Warrant and shall be enforceable by
    the Holder or holder of Warrant Shares.
 
    l)        Amendment.  This Warrant may be modified or amended or the
    provisions hereof waived with the written consent of the Company and
    Holders holding Warrants at least equal to 67% of the Shares and
    Warrant Shares issuable upon exercise of all then outstanding Warrants.
 
    m)      Severability.  Wherever possible, each provision of this
    Warrant shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and
    valid under applicable law, but if any provision of this Warrant shall
    be prohibited by or invalid under applicable law, such provision shall
    be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without
    invalidating the remainder of such provisions or the remaining
    provisions of this Warrant.
 
    n)       Headings.  The headings used in this Warrant are for the
    convenience of reference only and shall not, for any purpose, be deemed
    a part of this Warrant.
