Commission but excluding those directors that are employed by the Company, 
its parent company Dalian Wanda Group Co., Ltd., or their affiliates (the 
Non-Employee Directors), will receive the following compensation:
 
    ·                  an annual cash retainer of $50,000;
     
    ·                  an annual stock award with a value of $100,000;
     
    ·                  an annual cash retainer of $5,000 for service on
    each of the Companys Audit, Compensation and Nominating & Corporate
    Governance Committees;
     
    ·                  an annual cash retainer of $15,000 for service as
    the chairman of the Companys Audit Committee; and
     
    ·                  an annual cash retainer of $10,000 for service as
    the chairman of each of the Companys Compensation and Nominating &
    Corporate Governance Committees.
     
Stock awards will be made pursuant to the Companys 2013 Equity Incentive

$100,000 by the average closing price of the stock for the five trading 
days prior to the date of the stock award.  If a director begins service 
after the first business day of a calendar year, the annual cash retainer 
and the annual stock award will be prorated for the partial year of 
service.
 
Additionally, the Company shall reimburse the Non-Employee Directors for 
their reasonable out-of-pocket travel and related expenses incurred in 
connection with their service on the Board.
