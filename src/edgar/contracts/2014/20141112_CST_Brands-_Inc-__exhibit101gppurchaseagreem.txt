WHEREAS, CST desires to cause GP Buyer to purchase all of the Membership 
Interests from LGC and become the sole member of Lehigh GP, and LGC desires 
to sell all of the Membership Interests to GP Buyer and cease to be a 
member of Lehigh GP, in each case upon the terms and subject to the 
conditions set forth in this Agreement; and


WHEREAS, the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this 
Agreement shall occur contemporaneously with, and is expressly conditioned 
upon, the consummation of the transactions contemplated by that certain IDR 
Purchase Agreement, dated of even date herewith, by and among the IDR 
Sellers, IDR Buyer and CST (the “IDR Purchase Agreement”).


NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual terms, conditions and other 
agreements set forth in this Agreement, and such other good and valuable 
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby 
acknowledged, the Parties hereby agree as follows:


ARTICLE I


SALE AND PURCHASE


Section 1.1    Agreement to Sell and to Purchase.

      (a)
On the Closing Date and upon the terms and subject to the conditions set 
forth in this Agreement, in consideration of the Purchase Price, LGC shall 
sell, assign, transfer, convey and deliver to GP Buyer, and CST shall cause 
GP Buyer to purchase and accept from LGC, the Membership Interests, free 
and clear of any pledges, restrictions on transfer, proxies, voting or 
other agreements, liens, claims, charges, mortgages, security interests or 
other legal or equitable encumbrances, limitations or restrictions of any 
nature whatsoever (collectively, the “Encumbrances”), except for (1) 
restrictions on transfer arising under applicable securities Laws, (2) the 
applicable terms and conditions of the Partnership Agreement and (3) the 
applicable terms and conditions of the Lehigh GP LLC Agreement.
      (b)
The closing of the sale and purchase set forth in Section 1.1(a) (the “
Closing”) shall take place at 9:00 a.m. (Central Time) at the offices of 
Paul Hastings LLP in Houston, Texas, or at such other time and location as 
the Parties shall agree in writing, on a date to be specified by the 
Parties, which shall be the later of (i) the third Business Day following 
the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law) waiver by the Party or 
Parties entitled to the benefits thereof of the conditions set forth in 
Article VI (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be 
satisfied at the Closing) and (ii) October 1, 2014. The date on which the 
Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the “Closing Date.”
      (c)
GP Buyer hereby agrees, and LGC hereby acknowledges, that effective 
simultaneously with the Closing and its acquisition of all of the 
Membership Interests by delivery of the GP Assignment by LGC to GP Buyer, 
GP Buyer will:
            (i)
be bound by and subject to the terms and conditions of the Lehigh GP LLC 
Agreement, and GP Buyer acknowledges that Lehigh GP is a party to, bound by

member of Lehigh GP and cease to have or exercise any right or power as a 
member of Lehigh GP, except for the rights of indemnification as provided 
by the Lehigh GP LLC Agreement and the Partnership Agreement. The

subsection of this Agreement and any other section or subsection of this 
Agreement to the extent the applicability of such disclosure to such other 
section or subsection is reasonably apparent on its face to the

any Subsidiary of the Partnership uses or occupies or has the right to use 
or occupy any material real property (such property subject to a lease, 
sublease or other agreement, the “Lehigh Leased Real Property,” and such 
leases, subleases and other agreements are, collectively, the “Lehigh Real 
Property Leases”), in each case, free and clear of all Encumbrances other

Property Lease.

conduct its business as currently being conducted.


Section 3.15    Environmental Matters.


Except as set forth in Schedule 3.15:

      (a)

To the Knowledge of LGC, each of the Partnership Entities, as applicable, 
has obtained all material permits, licenses, franchise authorities, 
consents and approvals necessary for owning and operating its assets and 
business as it is presently conducted under all applicable Environmental 
Laws, and all such permits, licenses, franchises, authorities, consents and 
approvals remain in full force and effect, are issued in the correct 
entity’s name and

11
------------------------------------------------------------------------




            there are no circumstances existing that could reasonably be
            expected to result in such permits, licenses, franchises,
            authorities, consents or approvals being revoked or not renewed
            or any pending applications for such permits, licenses,
            franchises, authorities, consents or approvals being denied.

      (c)
There are no pending Legal Proceedings or, to the Knowledge of LGC, 
threatened, material claims, demands, actions, administrative proceedings, 
lawsuits or investigations against any of the Partnership Entities relating 
to or otherwise affecting any of their respective properties under any 
Environmental Laws. There are no facts or circumstances that reasonably 
would give rise to a Legal Proceeding or material demand against any of the 
Partnership Entities affecting any of their respective assets or properties 
under any Environmental Laws.
      (d)
To the Knowledge of LGC, there has been no Release of any Hazardous 
Material into the environment by the Partnership Entities or onto, beneath 
or migrating towards any of their respective properties or assets that 
could reasonably be expected to result in any material remedial or 
corrective action obligation on the part of the Partnership Entities under 
Environmental Laws. None of the Partnership Entities’ properties is listed 
on the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability 
Information System (CERCLIS) list or the National Priorities List or any

Hazardous Materials and the Partnership is not identified as a potentially 
responsible party on any such list maintained by any Governmental Authority 
that relates to Releases of Hazardous Materials.
      (e)
To the Knowledge of LGC, there has been no exposure of any person or 
property to any Hazardous Material from, by or in connection with the 
Partnership Entities’ properties or operations that could reasonably be 
expected to form the basis of a claim for material damages or compensation.
      (f)
LGC has made available to GP Buyer materials summarizing all environmental 
matters, remedial obligations, whether covered or not by the Escrowed 
Environmental Funds (defined hereafter), and environmental liabilities 
relating to the Partnership Entities’ properties, assets, and operations.
      (g)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained elsewhere in this 
Agreement, no statement or representation is made in this Agreement 
regarding any compliance or failure to comply with, or any actual or 
contingent liability under, or claims, demands, actions, proceedings, 
lawsuits or investigations with respect to, any Environmental Law, except 
as set forth in this Section 3.15.

properties for which funds are held in escrow with respect to any 
environmental remediation obligations that are, have been or are to be 
undertaken with respect to any of the assets of the Partnership or its

as of the Execution Date, there is no basis to believe that the funds held 
in escrow are insufficient to undertake all environmental remediation 
obligations that exist with respect to such properties.

Except as disclosed on Schedule 3.16, none of the Partnership Entities has

Partnership Credit Agreement;
            (iii)
a contract, lease or license (including any seismic licensing agreement) 
that is material to the Partnership Entities taken as a whole;

12
------------------------------------------------------------------------

in this Agreement as the “Partnership Material Contracts.”

      (b)
Other than as a result of the expiration or termination of any Partnership 
Material Contract in accordance with its terms and except as would not,

is valid and binding on each of the Partnership Entities that is a party 
thereto, as applicable, and is in full force and effect and enforceable in 
accordance with its terms against such Partnership Entity and, to the 
Knowledge of LGC, is valid and binding on the other party or parties

            Partnership Bank Waivers”), from the administrative agent named

            the “Partnership Lenders”), and shall provide all commercially
            reasonable assistance requested by the Partnership in
            connection therewith. The Parties shall cause the Partnership
            to pay any fee required by the Partnership Lenders to be paid
            in order to secure the Partnership Bank Waivers, which shall be
            borne pursuant to Section 9.3.

      (b)
CST shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the written consent 
to, and/or waiver of default or amendment of, the CST Credit Agreement in

Section 5.14    Employee Matters.  

      (a)
CST shall cause an Affiliate of GP Buyer to offer to each Subject Employee 
whose name is forth on Schedule 5.14 and remains employed by LGC 
immediately prior to January 1, 2015, employment effective as of January 1, 
2015, with each such offer to include a substantially equivalent level of 
responsibility and compensation and benefits that are at least comparable 
in the aggregate as each such employee had as an employee of LGC on the 
date hereof. Those employees of LGC that actually accept such offers of 
employment from an Affiliate of GP Buyer are referred to in this Agreement 
as “Transferred Employees.”
      (b)
CST shall cause service as an employee of LGC to be recognized for all 
purposes under any benefits plans (including severance plans) to which the 
Transferred Employees will become eligible. For a period of one year from

applicable Affiliates not to, (i) transfer any of the Transferred Employees 
to a permanent work location other than such Transferred Employee’s current 
work location, unless otherwise consented to by such employee or (ii) 
terminate any Transferred Employee, other than for cause.
      (c)
For a period of two years from and after the Closing Date, neither LGC nor 
any of its Affiliates shall solicit for employment or hire any of the 
Transferred Employees. The restrictions in this Section 5.14 regarding the 
prohibition on solicitations (as opposed to hires) shall not apply to any 
solicitation directed at the general public and the restrictions regarding 
hiring shall not apply to any former employee terminated by CST or any 
Affiliate of CST. For the avoidance of doubt, LGC’s continued employment of 
the Transferred Employees through December 31, 2014 shall not be deemed a 
violation of this Section 5.14(c).
      (d)
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Transferred Employees shall not be third 
party beneficiaries of this Agreement and this Section 5.14 shall not be 
deemed to amend any Employee Plan.

regulation of the SEC or to satisfy relevant disclosure obligations under 
the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, and in each case in connection with 
or as a consequence of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; 
provided, however, CST and GP Buyer shall indemnify LGC for any liabilities 
it incurs resulting from the use of such

            information in any financial statements prepared by CST, GP

filing of GP Buyer or its Affiliates to satisfy any rule or regulation of 
the SEC or to satisfy relevant disclosure obligations under the Securities 
Act or the Exchange Act, in each case in connection with or as a 
consequence of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, 
however, that CST and GP Buyer shall indemnify LGC for any liabilities it 
incurs resulting from the use of such information in any financial 
statements prepared by GP Buyer or its Affiliates, except for those 
liabilities based solely on the information provided by LGC.
      (d)
Financial Statement Diligence for Securities Offerings. LGC shall cause 
Lehigh GP to provide GP Buyer access to the accounting books and records

conduct customary due diligence with respect to the financial statements of 
Lehigh GP, the Partnership or the Subsidiaries of the Partnership for any 
offering of securities by GP Buyer or any of its Affiliates in which such

contesting or defending against any third-party Legal Proceeding (other 
than any Legal Proceedings in which CST, GP Buyer or any of their 
Affiliates and LGC or any of its Affiliates are adverse parties) in 
connection with (i) the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the 
IDR Purchase Agreement or (ii) any fact, situation, circumstance, status, 
condition, activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event, incident, action, 
failure to act or transaction on or prior to the Closing Date involving 
Lehigh GP, the Partnership or its Subsidiaries, each of the other Parties 
will cooperate with such Party and its counsel in the contest or defense, 
make available their personnel and provide such testimony and access to 
their books and records as shall be reasonably requested and necessary in 
connection with the contest or defense, all at the sole cost and expense of 
the contesting or defending Party; provided, however, that nothing in this 
Section 5.15(e) shall limit in any respect any rights a Party may have with 
respect to discovery or the production of documents or other information in 
connection with any such litigation.
      (f)

Affiliates shall use the Company Marks at a level of quality equivalent in 
all material respects to that in effect for Company Marks as of the Closing

failure of the conditions set forth in Section 6.2(c) or Section 6.2(d), 
and such Breach is incapable of being cured, or if capable of being cured, 
has not been cured within thirty (30) days following receipt by LGC of a 
Notification of such Breach from CST or GP Buyer.; or
            (iv)
by any Party, upon written notice to the other Parties, if the transactions 
contemplated by this Agreement have not been consummated on or before 
November 1, 2014 (the “Outside Date”); provided, however, that (i) LGC may 
not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(a)(iv) if such 
failure to consummate is due to the failure of LGC to perform or observe in 
all material respects the covenants and agreements of this Agreement to be 
performed or observed by LGC and (ii) CST and GP Buyer may not terminate 
this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(a)(iv) if such failure to 
consummate is due to the failure of CST or GP Buyer to perform or observe 
in all material respects the covenants and agreements of this Agreement to 
be performed or observed by CST or GP Buyer.

28
------------------------------------------------------------------------


      (b)
This Agreement shall automatically terminate and the transactions 
contemplated by this Agreement shall be abandoned if the IDR Purchase 
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Article VIII of the IDR Purchase 
Agreement.


Section 7.2    Effect of Termination.


In the event of termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Article VII, 
all rights and obligations of the Parties under this Agreement shall 
terminate, except the provisions of Section 5.8 (Confidential Information), 
Article VII (Termination), Article IX (Miscellaneous Provisions) and 
Article X (Definitions) shall survive such termination; provided, however, 
that nothing in this Agreement shall relieve any Party from any liability 
for any intentional or willful and material Breach by such Party and all 
rights and remedies of a non-breaching Party under this Agreement in the 
case of such intentional or willful and material Breach, whether arising at 
law or in equity, shall be preserved.


Section 7.3    Specific Performance.


The Parties acknowledge that, in view of the uniqueness of the transactions 
contemplated by this Agreement, the Parties will not have an adequate 
remedy at Law for monetary damages and will be irreparably damaged in the 
event that Closing fails to occur, or is rendered incapable of occurring, 
as a result any other Party’s Breach of any term of this Agreement; and, 
therefore, the Parties agree that each Party, as the case may be, shall be 
entitled to specific enforcement of the terms of this Agreement to compel 
the other Parties, as the case may be, to consummate the transactions 
contemplated by this Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions of this 
Agreement.


ARTICLE VIII

The representations and warranties of LGC contained in this Agreement or in 
any certificates or other documents delivered pursuant to this Agreement on 
the Closing Date shall survive the Closing for a period of twelve (12) 
months following the Closing Date, at which time such representations or 
warranties will terminate, and no indemnification obligations or any other 
action, claim or proceeding will be associated therewith, based thereon or

Agreement; Authorization), Section 2.5 (Capitalization of Lehigh GP; 
General Partner Interest), Section 2.11 (Brokers), Section 3.1

Section 3.9 (Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities) and Section 3.15 
(Environmental Matters) shall survive Closing for a period of thirty six 
(36) months following the Closing Date, and (iii) the representations and 
warranties set forth in Section 2.12 (Employees: Employee Plans), Section 
3.8 (Tax Matters) (excluding Section 3.8(c)) and Section 3.12 (Employees; 
Employee Plans) shall survive for a period ending thirty (30) days after

thereof. For the avoidance of doubt, the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall

3.8(c).
      (b)
The representations and warranties of CST and GP Buyer contained in this 
Agreement or in any certificates or documents delivered pursuant to this 
Agreement on the Closing Date shall survive the Closing for a period of 
twelve (12) months following the Closing Date, at which time such 
representations or warranties will terminate, and no indemnification 
obligations or any other action, claim or proceeding will be associated 
therewith, based thereon or otherwise brought, claimed or noticed following 
such termination; provided, however, that the representations and 
warranties set forth in Section 4.1 (Organization; Qualification), Section 
4.2 (Validity of Agreement; Authorization) and Section 4.5 (Brokers) shall 
survive indefinitely (collectively, the “Buyer Fundamental Representations
”).
      (c)
All covenants and agreements that by their terms apply or are to be 
performed in whole or in part after the Closing will survive for the period 
provided in such covenants and agreements, if any, or until fully 
performed. All covenants and agreements that by their terms are to be 
performed in their entirety prior to the Closing shall terminate at the 
Closing.

becomes due or payable by reason of the termination of an employee of LGC 
or its Affiliates that arises upon or after consummation of the 
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the IDR Purchase Agreement 
to the extent such payment or other Loss is not a Change of Control 
Termination Payment; or
            (vi)
any breach by the IDR Sellers of the IDR Purchase Agreement for which IDR 
Buyer would be entitled to indemnification pursuant to the terms and 
conditions of the IDR Purchase Agreement.
      (b)

any breach by CST or IDR Buyer of the IDR Purchase Agreement for which the 
IDR Sellers would be entitled to indemnification pursuant to the terms and 
conditions of the IDR Purchase Agreement.
      (c)
In addition to the temporal limitations set forth in Section 8.1, the 
foregoing indemnification obligations shall be subject to the following 
limitations:

, however, that the Cap shall not be applicable to (A) Losses with respect 
to the Seller Fundamental Representations or the Buyer Fundamental 
Representations, as applicable, in each case whether made in this Agreement 
or in the IDR Purchase Agreement, (B) Losses with respect to matters that 
constitute fraud or intentional misrepresentation, or (C) Losses with 
respect to the matters set forth in Section 8.2(a)(iii), Section 8.2(a)(v) 
and Section 8.2(b)(iv);

30
------------------------------------------------------------------------


            (ii)
no indemnification for any Losses asserted against LGC or the Topper Trust 
under Section 8.2(a)(i) or Section 7.2(a)(i) of the IDR Purchase Agreement 
or against CST, GP Buyer or IDR Buyer under Section 8.2(b)(i) or Section 
7.2(b)(i) of the IDR Purchase Agreement shall be required unless and until 
the cumulative aggregate amount of such Losses incurred by the Buyer 
Indemnified Parties or the Seller Indemnified Parties, in each case as a 
group, exceeds $1,000,000 (the “Deductible”), at which point LGC and the 
Topper Trust shall be obligated to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties 
or CST, GP Buyer and the IDR Buyer shall be obligated to indemnify the 
Seller Indemnified Parties, as the case may be, only for the amount of such 
Losses in excess of the Deductible; provided, however, that the Deductible 
shall not be applicable to (A) Losses with respect to the Seller 
Fundamental Representations or the Buyer Fundamental Representations, as 
applicable, in each case whether made in this Agreement or in the IDR 
Purchase Agreement, (B) Losses with respect to matters that constitute 
fraud or intentional misrepresentation, or (C) Losses with respect to the 
matters set forth in Section 8.2(a)(iii), Section 8.2(a)(v) and Section 
8.2(b)(iv);
            (iii)
the amount of any Losses suffered by a Seller Indemnified Party or a Buyer 
Indemnified Party, as the case may be (such party seeking indemnification 
pursuant to this Article VIII, the “Indemnified Party,” and the other 
party, the “Indemnifying Party”), shall be reduced by any third-party 
insurance benefits or third party recoveries actually received, or the tax 
benefits recognizable, by the Indemnified Party with respect to such Loss 
(net of costs incurred to recover such insurance benefits and third party 
recoveries, deductibles and retropremiums);
            (iv)
no claim may be asserted nor may any action be commenced against any Party 
for Breach, unless written notice of such claim or action is received by 
the other Party describing in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances 
with respect to the subject matter of such claim or action on or prior to 
the date on which the representation or warranty on which such claim or 
action is based ceases to survive as set forth in Section 8.1; provided, 
however, that, notwithstanding the survival periods set forth in Section 
8.1, as to each claim for indemnification under this Agreement regarding a 
representation or warranty that is validly made before expiration of such 
representation or warranty, such claim and associated right to 
indemnification will not terminate before the final determination and 
satisfaction of such claim;
            (v)
no Indemnified Party shall be entitled under this Agreement to multiple 
recovery for the same Losses; and
            (vi)
with respect to any breach of Section 3.8(b), the Buyer Indemnified Parties 
shall not have any right to indemnification under this Agreement from and 
against any Losses or Taxes of Lehigh GP that are indemnified by CST and GP 
Buyer under Section 8.2(b)(iv).


Section 8.3    Procedures.


Any Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party (with reasonable 
detail) promptly after it becomes aware of facts supporting a claim or 
action for which indemnification is provided under this Article VIII, and 
shall provide to the Indemnifying Party as soon as practicable thereafter 
all reasonably available information and documentation necessary to support 
and verify any Losses associated with such claim or action. Subject to 
Section 8.2(c)(iv), the failure to so notify or provide information to the 
Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any 
liability that it may have to any Indemnified Party, except to the extent 
that the Indemnifying Party demonstrates that it has been materially 
prejudiced by the Indemnified Party’s failure to give such notice, in which 
case the Indemnifying Party shall be relieved from its obligations under 
this Agreement to the extent of such material prejudice. The Indemnifying 
Party shall participate in and defend, contest or otherwise protect the 
Indemnified Party against any such claim or action by counsel of the 
Indemnifying Party’s choice at the Indemnifying Party’s sole cost and 
expense; provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall not make any 
settlement or compromise without the prior written consent of the 
Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, 
conditioned or delayed) unless the sole relief provided is monetary damages 
that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party, there is no admission or 
statement of fault or culpability on the part of the Indemnified Party and 
there is an unconditional release of the Indemnified Party from all 
liability on any claims that are the subject of such claim or action. The 
Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts upon the 
reasonable request of the Indemnifying Party to cooperate with and assist 
the Indemnifying Party in defending, contesting, or otherwise protecting 
the Indemnified Party against any suit, action, investigation, claim or 
proceeding in connection with which a claim for indemnification is made. 
The Indemnified Party shall have the right, but not the obligation, to 
participate at the Indemnified Party’s own expense in the defense thereof 
by counsel of the Indemnified Party’s choice; provided, however, that the 
Indemnifying Party shall pay the fees and expenses of separate counsel for 
the Indemnified Party if (a) the Indemnifying Party has agreed to pay such 
fees and expenses, or (b) counsel for the Indemnifying Party reasonably 
determines that representation of


31
------------------------------------------------------------------------




both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party by the same counsel 
would create a conflict of interest. If the Indemnifying Party fails timely 
to defend, contest or otherwise protect against such suit, action, 
investigation, claim or proceeding, the Indemnified Party shall have the 
right to do so, including, without limitation, the right to make any 
compromise or settlement thereof, and the Indemnified Party shall be 
entitled to recover the entire cost thereof from the Indemnifying Party, 
including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees, disbursements 
and amounts paid as the result of such suit, action, investigation, claim 
or proceeding.


Section 8.4    No Speculative Damages.


NOTWITHSTANDING ANY PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT TO THE CONTRARY, IN NO 
EVENT SHALL ANY PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT BE LIABLE TO ANY OTHER PARTY OR ANY 
INDEMNIFIED PARTY FOR ANY LOSSES THAT CONSTITUTE SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, 
INCIDENTAL OR OTHER INDIRECT DAMAGES OR ANY PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES 
ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING ANY BREACH 
OR ALLEGED BREACH OF ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, COVENANT OR AGREEMENT IN 
THIS AGREEMENT), WHETHER SUCH LOSSES ARE BASED ON BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT 
(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHER THEORY OF LIABILITY, INCLUDING DIMINUTION 
OF VALUE OR LOSSES DETERMINED AS A MULTIPLE OF INCOME; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, 
THAT THIS SECTION 8.4 SHALL NOT LIMIT AN INDEMNIFIED PARTY’S RIGHT TO 
RECOVERY HEREUNDER FOR ANY SUCH LOSSES TO THE EXTENT SUCH INDEMNIFIED PARTY 
IS REQUIRED TO PAY SUCH LOSSES TO A THIRD PARTY IN CONNECTION WITH A MATTER 
FOR WHICH SUCH INDEMNIFIED PARTY IS OTHERWISE ENTITLED TO INDEMNIFICATION 
HEREUNDER.


Section 8.5    Remedy.


The Parties agree that equitable relief for matters arising under this 
Agreement after Closing is only available to the extent provided for in 
Section 5.8(b) or in Section 9.10. Except for actions involving fraud or 
intentional misrepresentation, and for equitable relief as provided in the 
preceding sentence, from and after the Closing, the sole and exclusive 
remedy of a Party in connection with any matter arising under this 
Agreement shall, in each case, be indemnification under and as set forth in 
this Article VIII.


Section 8.6    Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments.


Each Party, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, agrees to treat any 
payments made pursuant to this Article VIII as adjustments to the Purchase 
Price for all federal and state income and franchise Tax purposes.


ARTICLE IX


MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS


Section 9.1    Publicity.


On or prior to the Closing Date, no Party shall, nor shall it permit its 
Affiliates to, issue or cause the publication of any press release or other 
announcement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions 
contemplated by this Agreement without the consent of the other Parties. 
Each Party hereby agrees to the form of press releases announcing this 
transaction exchanged among the Parties prior to the Execution Date. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event any such press release or 
announcement is required by Law or stock exchange rule to be made by the 
Party proposing to issue the same, such Party may issue or cause 
publication thereof without consent of the other Parties, but shall use its 
commercially reasonable efforts to consult in good faith with the other 
Parties prior to such issuance or publication.


Section 9.2    Successors and Assigns; Third-Party Beneficiaries.


This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of, and be binding on, the 
Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. No Party 
shall assign or delegate any of its rights or obligations created under 
this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Parties; 
provided, however, that GP Buyer may assign all or any portion of its 
rights and obligations under this Agreement to any Affiliate of CST. Except 
as contemplated by Section 5.10 or Article VIII, nothing in this Agreement 
shall confer upon any Person not a party to this Agreement, or the legal 
representatives of such Person, any rights or remedies of any nature or 
kind whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.


Section 9.3    Fees and Expenses.


Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, all legal, 
accounting, financial advisory and other fees, costs and expenses of a 
Party incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions 
contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid


32
------------------------------------------------------------------------




by the Party incurring such fees, costs or expenses. Notwithstanding the 
foregoing sentence in this Section 9.3, to the extent that Lehigh GP or the 
Partnership incur any fees or expenses in connection with the transactions 
contemplated by this Agreement or any other Transaction Document, CST shall 
be responsible, and shall reimburse Lehigh GP or the Partnership, as 
applicable, for any such fees and expenses; provided, however, that CST 
shall not be obligated to reimburse Lehigh GP or the Partnership for any 
fees or expenses the type of which are contemplated in Section 2.11 in 
excess of $1,000,000 in the aggregate, whether under this Agreement or the 
IDR Purchase Agreement.

Section 9.4.


Section 9.5    Entire Agreement.


This Agreement, together with the Schedules and the Exhibits hereto, the 
other Transaction Documents and the Confidentiality Agreement represent the 
entire agreement and understanding of the Parties with respect to the 
transactions set forth herein and therein, and no representations or 
warranties have been made in connection herewith or therewith other than 
those expressly set forth herein or therein. This Agreement, together with 
the Schedules and the Exhibits hereto, the other Transaction Documents and

Agreement, the other Transaction Documents and the Confidentiality 
Agreement, as applicable. No prior drafts of such documents and no words or 
phrases from any such prior drafts shall be admissible into evidence in any 
action or suit involving such documents.


33
------------------------------------------------------------------------




Section 9.6    Waivers and Amendments.


LGC (on the one hand) or CST and GP Buyer (on the other hand) may, by 
written notice to the other Party: (a) extend the time for the performance 
of any of the obligations or other actions of such other Party; (b) waive 
any inaccuracies in the representations or warranties of such other Party 
contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this 
Agreement by such other Party; (c) waive compliance with any of the 
covenants of such other Party contained in this Agreement; (d) waive 
performance of any of the obligations of such other Party created under 
this Agreement; or (e) waive fulfillment of any of the conditions to its 
own obligations under this Agreement or in any documents delivered pursuant 
to this Agreement by such other Party. The waiver by any Party of a Breach 
of any provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a 
waiver of any subsequent Breach, whether or not similar, unless such waiver 
specifically states that it is to be construed as a continuing waiver. This 
Agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented only by a written 
instrument executed by all of the Parties.


Section 9.7    Severability.


This Agreement shall be deemed severable, and the invalidity or 
unenforceability of any specific term or provision of this Agreement shall 
not affect the validity or enforceability of this Agreement or of any other 
term or provision of this Agreement. Furthermore, in lieu of any such 
invalid or unenforceable term or provision, the Parties shall negotiate in 
good faith to modify this Agreement to include a provision as similar in 
terms to such invalid or unenforceable provision as may be possible and be 
valid and enforceable.


Section 9.8    Titles and Headings.


The Article and Section headings and any table of contents contained in 
this Agreement are solely for convenience of reference and shall not affect 
the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement or of any term or provision 
hereof.


Section 9.9    Signatures and Counterparts.


Facsimile or electronic transmission of any signed original document and/or 
retransmission of any signed facsimile or electronic transmission shall be 
the same as delivery of an original. At the request of any Party, the 
Parties will confirm facsimile or electronic transmission by signing a 
duplicate original document. This Agreement may be executed in two or more 
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which 
together shall be considered one and the same agreement.


Section 9.10    Post-Closing Enforcement of the Agreement; Damages.


Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that an award of monetary 
damages would be inadequate for any Breach of this Agreement by any Party 
of any covenant or obligation to be performed after the Closing, and any 
such Breach would cause the non-breaching Parties irreparable harm. Each of 
the Parties acknowledges and agrees that in the event any covenant or 
obligation of the acknowledging Party to be performed after Closing is not 
performed in accordance with the specific terms of this Agreement or is 
otherwise breached, then the other Party shall be entitled to an injunction 
or injunctions to prevent such non-performance or Breach and to 
specifically enforce the covenants and obligations of the acknowledging 
Party to be performed after Closing, in any courts of the State of 
Delaware, and in the federal courts of the United States of America located 
in Delaware, in addition to any other remedy to which the non-breaching 
Party may be entitled for such non-performance or Breach.


Section 9.11    Governing Law.


This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the 
internal and substantive Laws of the State of Delaware and without regard 
to any conflicts of Laws concepts that would apply the substantive Law of 
some other jurisdiction.


Section 9.12    Disclosure.


Certain information set forth in the Schedules is included solely for 
informational purposes, is not an admission of liability with respect to 
the matters covered by the information, and may not be required to be 
disclosed pursuant to this Agreement. Disclosure of any item in any section 
of the Schedules shall serve to qualify the correspondingly numbered 
section or subsection of this Agreement and any other section or subsection 
of this Agreement to the extent the applicability of such disclosure to 
such section or subsection is reasonably apparent on its face to the 
non-disclosing party. The specification of any dollar amount in the 
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or the inclusion 
of any specific item in the Schedules is not intended to imply that such 
amounts (or higher or lower amounts) or specific item are or are not 
material, and no party shall use the fact of the setting of such amounts or 
the fact of the inclusion of any such item in the Schedules in any dispute 
or controversy between the Parties as to whether any obligation, item, or 
matter not described in this Agreement or included in a Schedule is or is 
not material for purposes of this Agreement.


34
------------------------------------------------------------------------




Section 9.13    Consent to Jurisdiction.


To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, the Parties hereby 
irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of 
Delaware and of the federal courts of the United States of America located 
in Delaware over any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement
