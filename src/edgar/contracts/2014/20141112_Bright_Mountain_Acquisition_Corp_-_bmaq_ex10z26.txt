CORPORATE USE OFFICE LEASE


 This Corporate Use Office Lease (Lease) is made and entered into as of
 the 25th day of August, 2014, by and between OIII Realty Limited
 Partnership, a Nevada limited partnership authorized to transact business
 in Florida (Lessor), having an address of 6400 Congress Avenue, Suite
 2200, Boca Raton, Florida 33487 and Bright Mountain Holdings, Inc.
 (Lessee), having an address of 6400 Congress Ave., Suite 1200, Boca
 Raton, FL 33487.

 For and in consideration of the mutual covenants herein contained, Lessor
 hereby leases to Lessee, and Lessee hereby rents from Lessor, those
 certain premises located at 6400 Congress Avenue, Suite 2050, Boca Raton,
 Florida 33487 (Premises) which are situated within the building located
 at 6400 Congress Avenue, Boca Raton, Florida 33487 (Building), and which
 are more particularly described as follows:

See Exhibit A attached hereto and made a part hereof

 For all purposes hereunder the Premises shall be deemed to consist the
 square feet set forth on the Informational Sheet, regardless of the actual
 measurable square footage of the Premises. It is understood that such
 measurement is made pursuant to Building Owners and Managers Association
 (BOMA) Guidelines for a Standard Method for Measuring Floor Area in Office
 Buildings, and is based on rentable not useable area, and includes a load
 factor for use by Lessee of the common areas of the Building.

1.
 TERM. A. The term of this Lease shall be three (3) years, commencing on
 the 15th day of September, 2014 and ending on the 14th day of September,
 2017 (Lease Term). Lessees obligation for the payment of rent shall
 commence on September 15, 2014 (Commencement Date).

B.
 Delivery Date by Premises. Lessee may access space to commence Lessees
 build-out upon execution hereof and payment of first last and security to
 Lessor. Lessee herein covenants and agrees to cause the construction of
 Lessees Work to be undertaken promptly, to be performed and completed
 diligently and continuously, and to cause the Premises and surrounding
 area to be completed on the Commencement Date. Lessee, prior to
 commencement of any work, shall provide Lessor with proof of adequate
 insurance naming the Lessor as an additional insured. All subcontractors
 shall be required to have adequate insurance and proof of same provided to
 Lessor prior to any work.

C.
 So long as Lessee is not in default hereunder, Lessee shall have the
 option to renew this Lease for one (1) additional three (3) year term at
 the rate set forth in the Informational Sheet, by providing Lessor written
 notice of the exercise thereof at least one hundred eighty (180) days
 prior to the end of the Lease Term (the Renewal Term). Failure to timely
 renew the Lease shall terminate all renewal options granted hereunder. The
 terms Lease Term and Renewal Term are sometime referred to herein as the
 Term.

2.
 RENT. A. Base Rent: Lessee agrees to pay Lessor, without demand, set off
 or deduction, rent for the term of the Lease in the amount set forth on
 the Informational Sheet plus applicable sales tax, payable in equal
 monthly installments (Monthly Rent) in the amount set forth on the
 Informational Sheet plus applicable sales tax on the first day of each
 month over the first year of the term of the Lease (Base Rent). Base
 Rent or any other monthly charges due Lessor hereunder shall be deemed
 past due as of the fifth (5th) day of the month, and any other charges
 shall be deemed past due on the fifth (5th) day following receipt of
 invoice for same. If any past due Base Rent or Additional Rent,
 hereinafter defined, is reduced to judgment, the Lessee agrees that the
 judgment shall continue to bear interest at the maximum rate permitted at
 law.

 If the Rent Commencement Date shall be a day other than the first (1st)
 day of a calendar month, then the Rent (as adjusted) for the period from
 the first Rent Commencement Date through the end of the month in which
 said first Rent Commencement Date occurs shall be prorated and shall be
 due and payable prior to occupancy hereunder.





------------------------------------------------------------------------

B.
 Rent Terms: All sums payable under this Paragraph shall be Additional
 Rent. All sums payable by Lessee to Lessor under this Lease as Annual Rent
 or Additional Rent or otherwise shall be subject to all applicable sales
 and other governmental charges now or hereinafter enacted. Any delay or
 failure of Lessor under this Paragraph or otherwise in rendering any
 Monthly Rent adjustment notice, statement, Lessors Expense Computation
 (estimated or actual), or bill shall not prejudice Lessors right to
 thereafter render the same or others, nor constitute a waiver of or impair
 Lessees continuing obligation to make the payments required by this
 Lease. Any obligation of Lessee under this Lease to pay Additional Rent or
 of Lessor to make any refund to Lessee shall survive the expiration of the
 Term and shall be discharged by payment in cash when and as the amount of
 same is determined. Base Rent, Monthly Rent, Annual Rent and Additional
 Rent are also collectively referred to hereunder as Rent.

C.
 Covenant to Pay Rent: Lessee shall pay to Lessor the Rent, as it may be
 adjusted, any Additional Rent, and any other sums due hereunder as herein
 provided at Lessors above-stated address, or at such other place as
 Lessor may designate in writing, without demand and without counterclaim,
 deduction, or setoff.

D.
 Place of Payment: All payments of Rent shall be made and paid by Lessee to
 Lessor at 6400 Congress Ave., Suite 2200, Boca Raton, Florida 33487, or at
 such other place as Lessor may, from time to time, designate in writing to
 Lessee. All Rent shall be payable in current legal tender of the United
 States, as the same is then by law constituted. Any extension, indulgence,
 or waiver granted or permitted by Lessor in the time, manner or mode of
 payment of Rent, upon any one (1) occasion, shall not be construed as a
 continuing extension, indulgence or waiver, and shall not preclude Lessor
 from demanding strict compliance herewith.

E.
                   Financial Statements: INTENTIONALLY DELETE

3.
 SECURITY DEPOSIT. Lessee has already deposited with Lessor an amount equal
 the sum set forth on the Informational Sheet (Security Deposit). This
 sum shall be retained by Lessor as security for the payment by Lessee of
 the Base Rent and other sums payable by Lessee under this Lease and for
 the faithful performance by Lessee of all the other terms, covenants and
 conditions of this Lease. Lessor, at Lessors option and upon prior
 written notice to Lessee, may, at any time, apply the Security Deposit or
 any part thereof toward the payment of the Base Rent and/or Additional
 Rent and/or toward the performance of Lessees obligations under this
 Lease. The Security Deposit shall not constitute liquidated damages.
 Lessor shall return the unused portion of the Security Deposit, if any, to
 Lessee within thirty (30) days after the expiration of the Term if Lessee
 is not in breach of this Lease. If the Security Deposit is insufficient to
 cover Lessors actual damages, Lessee shall pay on demand to Lessor an
 amount sufficient to fully compensate Lessor for Lessees breach. Lessor
 may (but is not obligated to) exhaust any or all rights and remedies
 against Lessee before resorting to the Security Deposit. Lessor shall not
 be required to pay Lessee any interest on the Security Deposit nor hold
 same in a separate account. If Lessor sells the Building, Lessor shall
 deliver the Security Deposit, if applicable or the unapplied portion
 thereof to the new owner. Lessee agrees that if Lessor turns over the
 Security Deposit or the unapplied portion thereof to the new owner, Lessee
 shall look to the new owner only and not to Lessor for its return upon
 expiration of the Term. If Lessee assigns this Lease, the Security Deposit
 shall remain with Lessor for the benefit of the new tenant and shall be
 returned to such tenant upon the same conditions as would have entitled
 Lessee to its return. No mortgagee of the Building will be liable for the
 return of any portion of the Security Deposit, except to the extent
 actually received by such mortgagee.

4.
 LATE CHARGES. If Lessee shall pay Monthly Rent or any Additional Rent
 after the fifth (5th) day of the calendar month for which said payment is
 due, Lessee shall, in addition, pay a late charge equal to five percent
 (5%) of the amount not timely paid in order to defray Lessors additional
 processing costs. If Lessee shall pay Monthly Rent or any Additional Rent
 with a check or bank draft which is returned unpaid or uncollected, Lessee
 shall pay to Lessor, in addition to the total amount due and to any late
 charge, a Twenty-Five Dollar ($25.00) processing fee for each such check
 or bank draft. In addition, Lessee shall reimburse Lessor upon demand for
 all reasonable costs incurred by Lessor in the enforcement of any of the
 provisions of this Lease and/or the collection of any sums due to Lessor
 under this Lease including, without limitation, collection agency fees and
 attorneys fees through all appellate actions and proceedings, if any. 
 Without affecting or limiting the





------------------------------------------------------------------------

 default provisions hereof, Lessee shall pay Lessor interest at the highest
 non-usurious rate permitted by applicable law, from the due date until
 paid, on any rent due under this Lease that remains unpaid five (5) days
 after its due date and if any past due rent is reduced to judgment, the
 Lessee agrees that the judgment shall continue to bear interest at the
 maximum rate permitted at law.

5.
 HOLDING OVER. If Lessee retains possession of the Premises, or any part
 thereof, beyond the end of the Term, Lessee shall pay to Lessor an amount
 equal to 150% the Monthly Rent plus 150% any Additional Rent for the time
 Lessee thus remains in possession. In addition thereto, Lessee shall pay
 Lessor for all damages, consequential as well as direct, sustained by
 reason of Lessees retention of possession. The provisions of this
 Paragraph shall not limit or in any way impair or waive Lessors right to
 possession, right of re-entry or any other right or remedy given hereunder
 or pursuant to State or federal law.

6.
 LIENS. A. Lessee hereby pledges and conveys to Lessor a security interest
 (Lessors Lien) in all of Lessees furniture, furnishings, goods,
 chattels and fixtures of every nature, kind and description whatsoever
 situated upon the Premises as collateral security for the full and prompt
 payment of Monthly Rent and any Additional Rent as and when due and the
 full and faithful performance of Lessees covenants herein contained.

 sale, foreclosure, or by any other method, and that any and all costs
 incurred by Lessor by enforcement of this Lessors Lien shall be payable
 to Lessor by Lessee. Such lien may be further evidenced by a UCC-1
 Financing Statement, which UCC-1 Financing Statement may be filed by
 Lessor without further consent or action by Lessee.

 Lessee shall, within ten (10) days after notice from Lessor, discharge or
 bond off and indemnify Lessor, to Lessors sole satisfaction, against any
 construction liens for materials or labor claimed to have been furnished
 to the Premises on Lessees behalf. Lessee shall notify Lessor in writing

 permitted successors, assigns and/or sublessees, whether or not the same

 desire to assign the Lease or sublease the Premises, Lessor shall have the
 right, but not the obligation, to cancel or terminate the Lease and deal

 penalties and damages which may be imposed upon Lessor by reason or
 arising out of Lessees failure to fully and promptly comply with and
 observe the provisions of this Section. Lessee shall give prompt notice to
 Lessor of any notice it receives of the violation of any law or
 requirement of any public authority with respect to the Premises or the
 use or occupation thereof. Lessee shall neither permit nor commit any

 and all other sums payable under this Lease, should any or all of the
 Premises not be habitable for any extended period. All required insurance
 shall be underwritten by a company or companies approved by Lessor with
 general policyholders rating of A as rated in the most current
 available Bests Insurance Reports and qualified to do business in
 Florida, and a copy of the policy or policies and of the certificate(s) of
 such insurance and all endorsements thereto or replacements thereof, shall
 be delivered to Lessor immediately upon their issue.

C.
 Lessee shall comply, at Lessees cost and expense, with any and all
 requirements of the Southern Underwriters Board and of any federal,
 State, and municipal government applicable to the Premises for the
 correction, prevention and abatement of nuisances, unsafe or hazardous
 conditions, or other grievances arising from Lessees occupancy of the
 Premises. Lessee shall also comply in a timely manner with all
 occupational, professional and licensing requirements applicable to
 Lessees use of the Premises. Lessee shall promptly comply with any and
 all fire, emergency and evacuation procedures ordered by safety and
 regulatory officials having jurisdiction over the Building or the
 Premises.

D.
 Lessee shall comply with any and all requests made by Lessors fire or
 liability insurers with respect to the Building or the Premises, or both,
 at Lessees cost and expense. Lessee agrees to pay any





------------------------------------------------------------------------

 increase(s) in Lessors fire and/or liability insurance premiums over and
 above the rate in effect immediately prior to the date the Term commences
 caused by Lessees use or occupancy of the Premises.

E.
 Lessee shall not do or suffer anything to be done on or about the Premises
 that will or may increase the rate of insurance on the Building or the
 Common Areas. If, by reason of the failure of Lessee to comply with the
 terms of this Lease, or by reason of Lessees occupancy (even though
 permitted or contemplated by this Lease), the insurance rate shall at any
 time be higher, or notice is given that it shall be higher, than it would
 otherwise be for comparable commercial office space in the area of the
 Building, Lessor, in its sole discretion, may require Lessee to reimburse
 Lessor the part of all insurance premiums charged because of such
 violation or occupancy by Lessee, or Lessor may require Lessee to cease
 any such use which causes such higher premium. Any such reimbursement
 shall be Additional Rent hereunder.

F.
 In any event of loss or damage to the Building, the Premises, the Common
 Areas and or any contents, each party hereto shall look first to any
 insurance in its favor before making any claim against the other party. To
 the extent possible without additional cost, each party shall obtain for
 each policy of such insurance, provisions permitting waiver of any claim
 against the other party for loss or damage within the scope of such
 insurance, and each party, to such extent permitted, for itself and its
 insurers waives all such insured claims against the other party.

15.
 DIRECT CHARGES. Lessee shall pay any and all such direct charges for
 illumination, trash removal, garbage collection, telephone, electricity,
 gas, water, sewage disposal and other utilities used on the Premises
 directly to the providers of same promptly as and when due, including but
 not limited to, any and all required fees and deposits for service.
 Failure to timely pay same shall constitute a default hereunder.

16.
 DAMAGE TO PREMISES. If the Premises shall be destroyed or damaged by fire,
 windstorm, civil disturbance or other casualty during the Term so that the
 same shall be rendered untenantable, Lessor shall have the right to render
 the Premises tenantable by repairs made within one hundred eighty (180)
 days from the date of payment to Lessor of applicable insurance proceeds.
 Base Rent shall abate during such total casualty, but Additional Rent
 shall remain due and payable. If the Premises are not rendered tenantable
 within such time, it shall be the option of either Lessor or Lessee to
 terminate this Lease. If either Lessor or Lessee shall exercise its option
 to terminate this Lease pursuant to this Paragraph, Lessees obligation to
 pay both Monthly Rent and any Additional Rent shall cease at the time of
 said termination. If only a part of the Premises shall be destroyed,
 Monthly Rent only shall be apportioned for the remaining tenantable area
 as determined by Lessor, in Lessors sole discretion. Notwithstanding the
 foregoing, if the damage results from the fault of Lessee, or Lessees
 agents, employees, visitors, licensees or invitees, Lessee shall not be
 entitled to any abatement or reduction of rent.

 Although nothing contained in this Lease shall ever be construed as
 obligating Lessor to pay the premiums for any such insurance which Lessee
 is obligated to carry under this Lease, if, at any time during the
 continuance of this Lease, Lessee fails to deliver such policies and the
 evidence of payment of the premiums for such policies, Lessor may, at
 Lessors option, procure the said insurance and Lessee will owe Lessor
 reimbursement therefor immediately as Additional Rent, but such facts will
 never be construed as constituting a waiver by Lessor of the default
 hereunder committed by Lessee.

17.
 PERSONAL PROPERTY. All of Lessees personal property placed upon, or moved
 into the Premises shall be at the sole risk of Lessee, and Lessor shall
 not be liable (i) for any damage to any such personal property, or to
 Lessee or any third party, arising from the bursting or leaking of water
 pipes or from any other act whether by Lessor or by a third person, or
 (ii) for the negligence of any other person whomsoever, including without
 limitation, Lessor and Lessors agents, independent contractors,
 representatives, successors and assigns.

18.
 CONDEMNATION. If all or any portion of the Premises shall be taken, except
 temporarily, by any condemnation or eminent domain proceedings, this Lease
 shall terminate on the effective date of the final judicial order of
 taking. Lessor shall be entitled to all awards for such taking, except
 that Lessee shall be entitled to make a separate claim at the expense of
 Lessee against the condemning authority for moving expenses and for
 damages





------------------------------------------------------------------------

 to permitted fixtures installed in the Premises; provided, however, that
 any award made to Lessee shall be in addition to, and shall not reduce,
 any award which Lessor may claim in connection with such taking, and
 further provided that in no event shall Lessee have any claim for the
 value of any remaining portion of the Term. If only a part of the Premises
 shall be condemned, Monthly Rent only shall be apportioned for the
 remaining tenantable area as determined by Lessor, in Lessors sole
 discretion.

19.
 QUIET ENJOYMENT. Upon payment by Lessee of the Monthly Rent and any
 Additional Rent as and when due, and upon the faithful observance and
 performance of all of Lessees covenants herein contained, Lessee shall
 peaceably and quietly hold and enjoy the Premises for the Term without
 hindrance or interruption by Lessor, or by any other person or persons
 lawfully or equitably claiming by, through or under Lessor, subject,
 nevertheless, to all of the provisions and conditions of this Lease.

20.
 CONVEYANCES AND ENCUMBRANCES. Lessor shall have the unrestricted right to
 convey, transfer, mortgage or otherwise encumber the Premises. This Lease
 is and at all times shall be automatically by its terms subject and
 subordinate to all present and future mortgages to which Lessor is a party
 and which in any way affect the Premises or any interest therein, and to
 all recastings, renewals, modifications, consolidations, replacements or
 extensions of any such mortgage(s). Lessee agrees, within seven (7) days
 of any such request, to execute any and all documents or instruments
 requested by Lessor or by any mortgagee(s) to evidence the said
 subordinate condition of this Lease, as the same may have been amended, to
 any such financing, and to certify, when requested by Lessor or by any
 mortgagee(s), that this Lease is in full force and effect. This statement,
 commonly referred to as an estoppel certificate, shall be for the
 benefit of Lessor, and any purchaser or mortgagee of Lessor.

21.
 OWNERSHIP BY MORTGAGEE; LESSEES ATTORNMENT. A. If any mortgagee comes
 into possession or ownership of the Premises or of the Building, or
 acquires Lessors interest by foreclosure of a mortgage or otherwise,
 Lessee will attorn to such mortgagee. Lessee will not be entitled to a
 credit for Monthly Rent or any Additional Rent paid in advance in such
 event.

B.
 If any mortgagee(s) shall request reasonable modifications to this Lease
 as a condition to disbursing any monies to be secured by a mortgage
 encumbering the Premises, Lessee agrees that, within seven
 (7) days after such a request from Lessor, Lessee shall execute and
 deliver to Lessor an agreement, in form and substance satisfactory to
 Lessor and to said mortgagee(s), evidencing such modifications; provided,
 however, that such modifications do not increase Lessees monetary
 obligations under this Lease or materially adversely affect Lessees
 leasehold interest created by this Lease.

22.
 NOTICES. Whenever this Lease requires that notice or demand shall be given
 or served on either party to this Lease, such notice or demand shall be in
 writing and shall be delivered personally or forwarded by certified or
 registered mail, return receipt required, addressed as set forth at the
 beginning of this Lease.

23.
 ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Lease contains the complete, exclusive and entire
 agreement between Lessor and Lessee regarding occupation of the Building
 and lease of the Premises, and supersedes any and all prior oral and
 written agreements between Lessor and Lessee regarding such matters. This
 Lease may be modified only by an agreement in writing signed by both
 Lessor and Lessee, and no offer of surrender of the Premises by Lessee
 shall be binding unless accepted by Lessor in a writing signed by Lessor.

24.
 BENEFITS; BINDING EFFECT. This Lease shall be binding upon and inure to
 the benefit of the heirs, legal representatives and successors of Lessor
 and Lessee, and the assigns of Lessor and permitted assigns of Lessee, and
 shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State
 of Florida. Venue for any litigation which may arise in connection with
 this Lease, the Building or the Premises shall be in the county wherein
 the Premises are located.

25.
 SEVERABILITY. If any covenant or provision of this Lease, or the
 application thereof to any person or circumstance, shall to any extent be
 invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this Lease or the application
 of





------------------------------------------------------------------------

 such covenant or provision to persons or circumstances (other than those
 as to which it is held invalid or unen- forceable) shall not be affected
 thereby, and each and every other such covenant and provision of this
 Lease or portion thereof shall be valid and be enforced to the fullest
 extent permitted by law.

26.
 TOXINS. Given the humid conditions and warm climate in Palm Beach County,
 Florida, molds, mildew, toxins and/or fungi may exist or develop within
 the Premises (hereinafter referred to as the Toxins). Lessee is hereby
 notified that certain Toxins may be, or if allowed to remain without
 treatment for any period of time, become toxic and pose a health risk. By
 leasing the Premises, Lessee shall be deemed to have understood and
 assumed the risks associated posed by Toxins and to release, to the
 fullest extent permitted by law, the Lessor from any and liability
 resulting from same, including, but not limited to, any liability for
 incidental or consequential damages (which may result from the inability
 to possess all or any part of the Premises, inconvenience, moving costs,
 off-site leasing costs, storage costs, loss of time, lost wages, lost
 opportunities and/or personal injury or death). Without limiting the
 generality of the foregoing, leaks, leaving windows or exterior doors open
 for extended periods of time or during wet weather, wet flooring not
 timely dried, and moisture will contribute to the growth of Toxins. Lessee
 agrees that Lessor is not liable, and the Lessor disclaims any liability,
 loss or damage resulting from any illness, personal injury, death or
 allergic reactions which may be experienced by Lessee, its employees,
 and/or its or their guests and invitees as a result of Toxins.

27.
 REMEDIES CUMULATIVE. Lessors remedies under this Lease are cumulative,
 and the election of any right or remedy by Lessor shall not be deemed a
 waiver of any other right or remedy of Lessor under this Lease or
 otherwise.

28.
 ATTORNEYS FEES. If, by reason of Lessees Default, Lessor employs an
 attorney to enforce Lessors remedies or otherwise protect Lessors rights
 under this Lease, Lessee shall pay to Lessor any and all attorneys fees
 and court costs, through trial and on appeal, and all other costs and
 expenses incurred by Lessor as a result of Lessees Default. If any
 lawsuit is brought in connection with this Lease or the Premises, Lessee
 shall pay all attorneys fees and court costs, through trial and on
 appeal, and in any bankruptcy court action, incurred by Lessor in defense,
 counterclaim or crossclaim of any such action or proceeding.

29.
 NO WAIVER. The failure of Lessor to insist on the performance or
 observance by Lessee of any one or more conditions or covenants of this
 Lease shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment of the future
 performance of any such covenant or condition, and Lessees obligation
 with respect to such future performance shall continue in full force and
 effect.

30.
 LESSORS PROPERTY. Lessee shall look solely to Lessors ownership interest
 in the Building for the satisfaction of any judgment or decree requiring
 the payment of money by Lessor, or by Lessors agents, representatives,
 successors or assigns, to Lessee, or to any person claiming by or through
 Lessee, in connection with this Lease, and no other property or asset of
 Lessor real or personal, tangible or intangible, shall be subject to levy,
 execution or other enforcement procedure for the satisfaction of any such
 judgment or decree.

31.
 RADON GAS. Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas that, when it
 has accumulated in a building in sufficient quantities, may present health
 risks to persons who are exposed to it over time. Levels of radon that
 exceed federal and state guidelines have been found in buildings in
 Florida. Additional information regarding radon and radon testing may be
 obtained from your county public health unit.

32.
 GENDER. The terms Lessor and Lessee as herein contained shall include the
 singular and/or the plural, the masculine, the feminine, and/or the
 neuter, the heirs, successors, executors, administrators, personal
 representatives and/or assigns, wherever and whenever the context so
 requires or admits.

33.
 CAPTIONS. The captions of the various paragraphs of this Lease have been
 inserted for the purposes of convenience only. Such captions are not a
 part of this Lease and shall not be deemed in any manner to modify,
 explain, enlarge or restrict any of the provisions contained in this
 Lease.





------------------------------------------------------------------------

34.
 DEFAULT/REMEDIES. A. Lessee shall be in default hereunder if (i) Lessee
 fails to pay in full when due the Base Rent, as adjusted from time to time
 as herein provided, any Additional Rent hereunder, or any other sums
 payable under this Lease; (ii) Lessee fails to observe and perform any of
 the terms, covenants and/or conditions of this Lease not contemplated by
 clauses (i) or (iii) of this sentence and such default shall continue for
 more than ten (10) days after written notice from Lessor to Lessee; or
 (iii) the Premises shall be abandoned, deserted or vacated at any time
 during the Term of this Lease. The Premises and trade fixtures, equipment
 and furniture situated thereon shall be conclusively deemed abandoned by
 Lessee upon fifteen (15) consecutive days absence from the Premises by
 Lessee or its agents (unless such absence results from fire or other
 casualty) together with the failure to pay all rent due hereunder. In such
 event Lessor may enter the Premises and may remove all remaining trade
 fixtures and equipment at Lessees expense. All such property shall, at
 Lessors option, become the property of Lessor, or said property may be
 placed in storage at Lessees cost and expense, or sold or otherwise
 disposed of, in which event the proceeds of such sale or other disposition
 shall belong to Lessor.

 Default shall also occur if at any time during the Term there shall be
 filed by or against Lessee or its permitted successors, or assigns, then
 in possession of the Premises, in any court pursuant to any statute either
 of the United States or of any state or foreign jurisdiction, a petition
 (1) in bankruptcy, (2) alleging insolvency, (3) for reorganization, (4)
 for the appointment of a receiver, or (5) for an arrangement under the
 Bankruptcy Acts or Codes, or if a similar type of proceeding shall be
 filed and said proceeding is not set aside, vacated, discharged or bonded
 within thirty (30) days after the institution of same, then Lessor may
 terminate Lessees rights under this Lease by notice in writing to Lessee,
 and thereupon Lessee shall immediately quit and surrender the Premises to
 Lessor, but Lessee shall continue to be liable for the payment of Rent and
 all other sums due hereunder.

B.
 Remedies: In the event of any default by Lessee, Lessor may (1) cure
 Lessees default at Lessees cost and expense, and/or (2) reenter the
 Premises and remove all persons and all or any property therefrom, by any
 suitable action or proceeding at law, without being liable for any
 prosecution therefor or damages therefrom, and repossess and enjoy the
 Premises, with all additions, alterations and improvements, and Lessor
 may, at its option, repair, alter, remodel and/or change the character of
 the Premises as it may deem fit, and/or (3) at any time relet the Premises
 or any part or parts thereof, as the agent of Lessee or in Lessors own
 right, and/or (4) terminate this Lease upon not less than three (3) days
 written notice to Lessee, but in which event Lessee shall remain liable
 for all Rent.

C.
 In any case where Lessor has retaken possession of the Premises by reason
 of Lessees default or seeks such a retaking, Lessor may, at Lessors
 option, occupy the Premises or cause the Premises to be redecorated,
 altered, divided, consolidated with other adjoining Premises, or otherwise
 changed or prepared for reletting, and may relet the Premises or any part
 thereof as agent of Lessee or otherwise, for a term or terms to expire
 prior to, at the same time as, or subsequent to, the original expiration
 date of this Lease, at Lessors option, and receive the rent therefor.
 Rent so received shall be applied first to the payment of such expenses as
 Lessor may have incurred in connection with the recovery of possession,
 redecorating, altering, dividing, consolidating and other adjoining
 Premises, or otherwise changing or preparing for reletting, and the
 reletting, including brokerage and reasonable attorneys fees, including
 attorneys fees in bankruptcy, appellate and post-judgment proceedings.
 Thereafter, such rent shall be applied to the payment of damages in an
 amount equal to the rent hereunder, as adjusted and Additional Rent, and
 to the cost and expenses of performance of the other covenants of Lessee
 as herein provided. Lessee agrees, in any such case, whether or not Lessor
 has relet, to pay to Lessor damages equal to the Base Rent as adjusted and
 Additional Rent due hereunder, and other sums herein agreed to be paid by
 Lessee, less the net proceeds of the reletting, if any, as ascertained
 from time to time, and the same shall be payable by Lessee on dates as
 provided for in Article 2 above. In reletting the Premises as aforesaid,
 Lessor may grant rent concessions, and Lessee shall not be credited
 therewith. No such reletting shall constitute a surrender and acceptance
 or be deemed evidence thereof. If Lessor elects, pursuant hereto, actually
 to occupy and use the Premises or any part thereof during any part of the
 balance of the Term as originally fixed or since extended, there shall be
 allowed against Lessees obligation for rent or damages as herein defined,
 during the period of Lessors occupancy, the reasonable value of such
 occupancy, not to exceed in any event the rent herein reserved and such
 occupancy shall not relieve Lessee of its liability hereunder. Lessee
 hereby waives all right of





------------------------------------------------------------------------

 redemption to which Lessee or any person claiming under Lessee might be
 entitled by any law now or hereafter in force. Lessors remedies hereunder
 are in addition to any remedy allowed by law or in equity.

D.
 The exercise by Lessor of any right granted in this Article shall not
 relieve Lessee from the obligation to make all rental payments, and to
 fulfill all other covenants required by this Lease, at the time and in the
 manner provided herein. In the event of a default, if Lessor so desires,
 all current and future rent and other monetary obligations due hereunder
 shall become immediately due and payable. This includes any additions to
 Rent herein provided for the period from the date of an event of default
 until the end of the Term of this Lease, a sum equal to the Monthly Rent
 and Additional Rent required to be paid hereunder by Lessee, multiplied by
 the number of calendar months or portions thereof remaining in the Term of
 this Lease. Lessor shall not be required to relet the Premises nor
 exercise any other right granted to Lessor hereunder. If Lessor attempts
 to relet the Premises, the Lessor shall be the sole judge as to whether or
 not a proposed Lessee is suitable and acceptable.

 In the event of a breach by Lessee of any covenants or provisions hereof,
 Lessor shall have, in addition to any other remedies which it may have,
 the right to invoke any remedy allowed at law or in equity to enforce
 Lessors rights or any of them, as if re-entry and other remedies were not
 herein provided for. Lessee agrees that no demand for Rent and no re-entry
 for condition broken and no notice to quit possession or other notices
 prescribed by statute shall be necessary to enable Lessor to recover such
 possession, but that all right to any such demand and any such re-entry
 and any notice to quit possession or other statutory notices or
 prerequisites are hereby waived by Lessee.

 The maintenance of any action or proceeding to recover possession of the
 Premises, or any installment or installments of Rent or any other monies
 that may be due, or become due from Lessee to Lessor, shall not preclude
 Lessor from thereafter instituting and maintaining subsequent actions or
 proceedings for the recovery of possession of the Premises or of any other
 monies that may be due or become due from Lessee. Any entry or re-entry by
 Lessor shall not be deemed to absolve or discharge Lessee from liability
 hereunder.

E.
 If Lessee shall at any time be in default hereunder, and if Lessor shall
 deem it necessary to engage attorneys to enforce Lessors right hereunder,
 the determination of such necessity to be in the sole discretion of
 Lessor, then Lessee will reimburse Lessor for the reasonable expense
 incurred thereby, including, but not limited to, court costs and
 reasonable attorneys fees including attorneys fees in appellate and
 post- judgment proceedings and regardless of whether or not any action may
 be instituted. In addition to, and not in lieu of, the provisions
 contained in the immediately preceding sentence, in the event of any
 litigation between the parties hereto, the subject matter of which is this
 Lease or any matter contained herein, the prevailing party shall be
 entitled to recover from the non-prevailing party all court costs and
 reasonable attorneys fees including, but not limited to, attorneys fees
 in appellate and post-judgment proceedings.

F.
 Without affecting the default provisions hereof, any payment of Rent
 required by this Lease which remains unpaid for five (5) days after its
 due date shall bear interest at the then maximum non-usurious rate allowed
 under applicable law from the due date to the date of payment.

G.
 Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, all remedies of
 Lessor as herein provided are cumulative and Lessors exercise of any one
 or more of them shall not be deemed a waiver of any other remedy(ies)
 available to Lessor.

35.
 FORCE MAJEURE. Lessor does not warrant that any of the services which
 Lessor may supply, will be free from interruption. Lessee acknowledges
 that any one or more of such services may be suspended by reason of
 accident or repair, alterations or improvements necessary to be made, or
 by strikes or lockouts, or by reason of operation of law, or other causes
 beyond the reasonable control of Lessor. No such interruption or
 discontinuance of service shall ever be deemed an eviction or a
 disturbance of Lessees use, enjoyment and possession of the Premises or
 any part thereof, or render Lessor liable to Lessee for damages by
 abatement or reduction of Base Rent or any Additional Rent or relieve
 Lessee from the performance of any of Lessees obligations under this
 Lease.





------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, Lessee shall have the affirmative duty, upon any casualty,
 including, but not limited to, hurricane or tornado, to take all
 affirmative steps to protect the Premises and the Building on an expedited
 basis. These include pre-storm preparation to protect the Premises,
 installation of any available pre-storm protective devices, sealing of all
 doors and windows from water intrusion, and removal of valuable items of
 personal property or data. After any such event, Lessee shall take all
 action necessary to protect the Building and Premises, including removal
 of any dangerous conditions and sealing of all doors and windows from
 water intrusion. Prior to such post-event action, Lessee shall consult
 with Lessor regarding same, shall document all such damage via written and
 photographic evidence and shall save all receipts for any such work.

36.
 TIME OF THE ESSENCE. Each of Lessees covenants herein is a condition and
 time is of the essence with respect to the performance of every provision
 of this Lease and the strict performance of each shall be a condition
 precedent to Lessees rights to remain in possession of the Premises, or
 to have this Lease continue in effect.

37.
 HAZARDOUS WASTE. Lessee warrants and represents that it will, during the
 period of its occupancy of the Premises under this Lease, comply with all
 federal, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances with respect to
 the use, storage, treatment, disposal or transportation of Hazardous
 Substances. Lessee shall indemnify and hold Lessor harmless from and
 against any claims, fines, judgments, penalties, costs, liabilities or
 losses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys fees and
 costs at trial and on appeal) arising from the breach of the preceding
 warranty and representation.

 For the purposes of this Paragraph, the term Hazardous Substances shall
 be interpreted broadly to include but not be limited to, substances
 designated as hazardous under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act,
 42 U.S.C. §9601, et seq., the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, 33
 U.S.C. §1257, et seq., the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. §2001, et seq., or the
 Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of
 1980, 42 U.S.C. §9601, et seq., any applicable State Law or regulation.
 The term shall also be interpreted to include but not be limited to any
 substance which after release into the environment and upon exposure,
 ingestion, inhalation or assimilation, either directly from the
 environment or directly by ingestion through food chains, will or may
 reasonably be anticipated to cause death, disease, behavior abnormalities,
 cancer and/or genetic abnormalities, and oil and petroleum based
 derivatives.

 Lessee shall not store or dispose of any hazardous material or waste in or
 about the premises. Lessee shall indemnify and hold Lessor harmless from
 and against any claims, damages, costs, expenses or actions which arise
 out of any breach of this provision and such indemnity shall survive the
 termination of the Lease, except those specifically used in Lessees
 business, which use has been disclosed to and approved in writing by
 Lessor. In such event, Lessee shall properly dispose of same and shall
 provide Lessor with a written plan detailing such disposal.

 The provisions of this Paragraph shall be in addition to any other
 obligations or liabilities Lessee may have to Lessor at law and equity and
 shall survive termination of this Lease.

38.
 NO PARTNERSHIP. Nothing contained in this Lease shall constitute or be
 construed to be or create a partnership, joint venture or any other
 relationship between Lessor and Lessee other than the relationship of
 Lessor and Lessee.

39.
 NO OTHER REPRESENTATIONS. No representations or promises shall be binding
 on the parties hereto except those representations and promises contained
 herein or in some future writing signed by the party making such
 representations or promises.

40.
 LESSEES ACKNOWLEDGMENT: Lessee shall, from time to time, on not less than
 five (5) days prior written request by Lessor, execute, acknowledge, and
 deliver to Lessor a written statement certifying that this Lease is
 unmodified and in full force and effect, or that this Lease is in full
 force and effect as modified and listing the instruments of modification,
 the dates to which the rents and other charges have been paid, and whether





------------------------------------------------------------------------

 or not, to the best of Lessees knowledge, Lessor is in default hereunder
 and, if so, specifying the nature of the default, and such other matters
 as Lessor may reasonably request. It is intended that any such statement
 delivered pursuant to this Article may be relied upon by a prospective
 purchaser of Lessors interest or mortgagee of Lessors interest or
 assignee of any mortgage upon Lessors interest in the Building and/or the
 Common Areas.

41.
 WAIVER OF COUNTERCLAIM AND JURY TRIAL. TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW,
 LESSEE HEREBY WAIVES THE RIGHT TO INTERPOSE ANY COUNTERCLAIM (EXCEPT A
 MANDATORY COUNTERCLAIM UNDER FLORIDA LAW OR RULE OF PROCEDURE) IF LESSOR
 PURSUES ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING FOR THE POSSESSION OF THE PREMISES.
 LESSEE HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO ASSERT A DEFENSE BASED ON
 MERGER AND AGREES THAT NEITHER THE COMMENCEMENT OF ANY ACTION OR
 PROCEEDING, NOR THE SETTLEMENT THEREOF, NOR THE ENTRY OF JUDGMENT THEREIN
 SHALL BAR LESSOR FROM BRINGING ANY SUBSEQUENT ACTIONS OR PROCEEDINGS FROM
 TIME TO TIME. TO THE EXTENT SUCH WAIVER IS PERMITTED BY LAW, THE PARTIES
 WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN CONNECTION WITH
 THIS LEASE OR THE PREMISES.

42.
 ARTICLE AND PARAGRAPH HEADINGS. The Article and Paragraph headings in this
 Lease are intended for convenience only and shall not be taken into
 consideration in any construction or interpretation of this Lease or any
 of its provisions.

43.
 BROKERS. Each party represents to the other that they have dealt with no

 obstructions created or permitted by Lessee or resulting from Lessees
 operation. If in the opinion of Lessor unauthorized persons are using any
 of said Common Areas by reason of the presence of Lessee in the Building,

 appropriate proceedings. Nothing herein shall limit the right of Lessor at
 any time to remove any such unauthorized person from the Common Areas or
 to prohibit the use of any said Common Areas by unauthorized persons.

(3)

 employees vehicle license numbers within five (5) days after taking
 possession of the Premises and Lessee shall thereafter notify Lessor of

 of such service may be suspended by reason of accident or of repairs,
 alterations or improvements being made, or by strikes or lockouts, or by

 or disturbance of Lessees use or possession of the Premises, or render
 Lessor liable to Lessee for damages or abatement of rent or otherwise, or
 relieve Lessee from performance of Lessees obligations hereunder.
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, as a result of Lessors gross
 negligence, there is an interruption of service for more than thirty (30)

 conducting Lessees business, as reasonably determined by Lessor.

 Lessees use of electrical energy in the Premises shall not, at any time,
 exceed the capacity of any of the electrical conductors and equipment in

 electric service, Lessee shall not, without Lessors prior written consent
 in each instance, connect major equipment to the Building, electric
 distribution system, telephone system or make any alteration or addition

 Lessee, nor prevent Lessor from thereafter enforcing any such Rules and
 Regulations against any or all tenants of the Building.

30.
 Lessor reserves the right to make such other reasonable rules and
 regulation as in its judgment may from time to time be needed for safety
 and security, for care and cleanliness of the Building and for the
 preservation of good order therein. Lessee agrees to abide by all such
 Rules and Regulations hereinabove stated and any additional rules and
 regulations which are adopted so long as such additional Rules and
 Regulations are reasonable and thirty (30) days prior written notice of
 such additional Rules and Regulations are provided to Lessee.

31
 All wallpaper or vinyl fabric materials which Lessee may install on
 painted walls shall be applied with a strippable adhesive. The use of
 nonstrippable adhesives will cause damage to the walls when materials are
 removed, and repairs made necessary thereby shall be made by Lessor at
 Lessee's expense.

32.
 Lessee shall provide and maintain hard surface protective mats under all
 desk chairs which are equipped with coasters to avoid excessive wear and
 tear to carpeting. If Lessee fails to provide such mats, the cost of
 carpet repair of replacement made necessary by such excessive wear and
 tear shall be charged to and paid by Lessee.

33.
 Lessee will refer all contractors, contractors' representatives and
 installation technicians rendering any service to Lessee to Lessor for
 Lessor's supervision, approval, and control before performance of any
 contractual service. This provision shall apply to all work performed in
 the Building, including installations of telephones, telegraph equipment,
 electrical devices and attachments and installations of any nature
 affecting floors, walls, woodwork, trim, windows ceilings, equipment or
 any other physical portion of the Building.

34.
 Lessee shall give prompt notice to Lessor of any accidents to or defects
 in plumbing, electrical fixtures, or heating apparatus so that such
 accidents or defects may be attended to properly.


35.
 Lessee shall be responsible for the observance of all of the forgoing
 Rules and Regulations by Lessees employees, agents, clients, invitees and
 guests.

36.
 Lessee shall not allow its employees or invitees to park in other than
 designated areas, nor shall any washing of cars or car repairs be
 permitted in any parking areas, nor shall overnight parking be permitted,
 nor shall commercial trucks be allowed in the parking areas other than in
 designated delivery areas.

37.
 Other than for single-trip usages, Lessee shall make reservations for use
 of any elevators, which shall be accepted by Lessor on a first-come,
 first-serve basis.

38.
 These rules and Regulations are in addition to, and shall not be construed
 to in any way modify, alter or amend, in whole or in part, the terms
 covenants, agreements and conditions of any lease of premises in the
 Building.
