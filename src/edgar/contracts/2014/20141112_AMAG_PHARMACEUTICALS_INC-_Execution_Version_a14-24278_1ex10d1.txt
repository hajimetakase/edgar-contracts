Section 1.03                            Accounting Terms and Determinations
.
 
(a)                                 Generally.  All accounting terms not 
specifically or completely defined herein shall be construed in conformity 
with, and all financial data (including financial ratios and other 
financial calculations) required to be submitted pursuant to this Agreement 
shall be prepared in conformity with, GAAP applied on a consistent basis, 
as in effect from time to time, except as otherwise specifically prescribed 
herein or as disclosed to the Administrative Agent.
 
(b)                                 Changes in GAAP.  If at any time any 
change in GAAP would affect the computation of any financial ratio or 
requirement set forth in any Loan Document, and either (x) the Borrower or 
(y) within 30 days after delivery of any financial statements reflecting 
any change in GAAP (or after the Lenders have been informed of the change 
in GAAP affecting such financial statements, if later), the Administrative 
Agent or the Required Lenders shall so request, the Administrative Agent, 
the Lenders and the Borrower shall negotiate in good faith to amend such 
ratio or requirement to preserve the original intent thereof in light of 
such change in GAAP (subject to the approval of the Required Lenders); 
provided that, until so amended, (i) such ratio or requirement shall 
continue to be computed in accordance with GAAP prior to such change 
therein and (ii) the Borrower shall provide to the Administrative Agent and 
the Lenders financial statements and any other documents required under 
this Agreement or as reasonably requested hereunder setting forth a 
reconciliation between calculations of such ratio or requirement made 
before and after giving effect to such change in GAAP. Notwithstanding any 
other provision contained herein, all terms of an accounting or financial 
nature used herein shall be construed, and all computations and ratios 
referred to herein shall be made, without giving effect to any election 
under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 159 (or any other 
Financial Accounting Standard having a similar result or effect) to value 
any Indebtedness or other liabilities of the Borrower or any Subsidiary at 
fair value, as defined therein.  Anything in this Agreement to the 
contrary notwithstanding , any obligation of a Person under a lease 
(whether existing as of the Closing Date or entered into in the future) 
that is not (or would not be) required to be classified and accounted for 
as a capital lease on the balance sheet of such Person under GAAP as in 
effect on the Closing Date shall not be treated as a Capital Lease solely 
as a result of (x) the adoption of any changes in, or (y) changes in the 
application of, GAAP after the Closing Date; provided that all payments 
under any such lease shall continue to be treated as an expense for 
purposes of calculating Consolidated Net Income.
 
Section 1.04                            Rounding.  Any financial ratios 
required to be maintained by any Group Company pursuant to this Agreement 
shall be calculated by dividing the appropriate component by the other 
component, carrying the result to one place more than the number of places 
by which such ratio is expressed herein and rounding the result up or down 
to the nearest number (with a rounding-up if there is no nearest number).
 
Section 1.05                            Times of Day.  Unless otherwise 
specified, all references herein to times of day shall be references to 
Eastern time (daylight or standard, as applicable).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Section 1.06                            Classes and Types of Borrowings.  
The term Borrowing denotes the aggregation of Loans of one or more 
Lenders made to the Borrower pursuant to Article II on the same date, all 
of which Loans are of the same Class and Type (subject to Article III) and, 
except in the case of Base Rate Loans, have the same initial Interest 
Period.  Loans hereunder are distinguished by Class and Type.  The 
Class of a Loan (or of a Commitment to make such a Loan or of a Borrowing 
comprised of such Loans) refers to whether such Loan is a Term Loan, an 
Incremental Term Loan or Incremental Revolving Loan of a class established 
pursuant to Section 2.15, or a separate class of Extended Term Loans 
established in accordance with Section 2.16.  The Type of a Loan refers 
to whether such Loan is a Eurodollar Loan or a Base Rate Loan.  
Identification of a Loan (or a Borrowing) by both Class and Type (e.g., a 
Term Eurodollar Loan) indicates that such Loan is a Loan of both such 
Class and such Type (e.g., both a Term Loan and a Eurodollar Loan) or that 
such Borrowing is comprised of such Loans.
 
ARTICLE II
 
THE CREDIT FACILITIES
 
Section 2.01                            The Term Loans.  Subject to the 
terms and conditions set forth herein, each Term Lender severally agrees to 
make a Term Loan to the Borrower on the Closing Date in a principal amount 
not exceeding its Term Commitment.  The Term Borrowing shall be made from 
the several Term Lenders ratably in proportion to their respective Term 
Commitments.  The Term Commitments are not revolving in nature, and amounts 
repaid or prepaid prior to the Term Loan Maturity Date may not be 
reborrowed.
 
Section 2.02                            Notice of Borrowings.  The Borrower 
shall give the Administrative Agent a Notice of Borrowing not later than 
12:00 P.M. on (i) the Business Day immediately preceding the proposed 
Adjusted Base Rate Borrowing and (ii) the third Business Day before each 
Eurodollar Borrowing, specifying:
 
(a)                                 the date of such Borrowing, which shall 
be a Business Day;
 
(b)                                 the aggregate amount of such Borrowing;
 
(c)                                  the initial Type of the Loans 
comprising such Borrowing;
 
(d)                                 in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, 
the duration of the initial Interest Period applicable thereto, subject to 
the provisions of the definition of Interest Period and to Section 2.06(a
); and
 
(e)                                  the location (which must be in the 
United States) and number of the Borrowers account, to which funds are to 
be disbursed, which shall comply with the requirements of Section 2.03.
 
If the duration of the initial Interest Period is not specified with 
respect to any requested Eurodollar Borrowing, then the Borrower shall be 
deemed to have selected an initial Interest Period of one month, subject to 
the provisions of the definition of Interest Period and to Section 
2.06(a).
 
Section 2.03                            Funding of Loans.
 
(a)                                 Funding of Loans.  (i) Not later than 
12:00 P.M. on the date of each Borrowing (other than an Adjusted Base Rate 
Borrowing, or (ii) not later than 2:00 P.M. on the date of each Adjusted 
Base Rate Borrowing, each Lender participating therein shall make available 
its share of such Borrowing, in Federal or other immediately available 
funds, to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agents Office.  
Unless the Administrative Agent determines that any applicable condition 
specified in Article IV has not been satisfied, the Administrative Agent 
shall make the funds so received available to the Borrower in like funds as 
received by the Administrative Agent either by (A) crediting the account of 
the Borrower on the books of the Administrative Agent with the amount of 
such funds or (B) wire transfer of such funds, in each case in accordance 
with instructions provided to (and reasonably acceptable to) the 
Administrative Agent by the
 
46
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Borrower in the applicable Notice of Borrowing, or, if a Borrowing shall 
not occur on such date because any condition precedent herein shall not 
have been met, promptly return the amounts received from the Lenders in 
like funds, without interest.
 
(b)                                 Funding by the Administrative Agent in 
Anticipation of Amounts Due from the Lenders.  Unless the Administrative 
Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date 
of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the 
Administrative Agent such Lenders share of such Borrowing, the 
Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share 
available to the Administrative Agent on the date of such Borrowing in 
accordance with subsection (a) of this Section 2.03, and the Administrative 
Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower 
on such date a corresponding amount.  In such event, if a Lender has not in 
fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the 
Administrative Agent then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally 
agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such 
corresponding amount in immediately available funds with interest thereon, 
for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to 
the Borrower but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent 
at (i) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of 
the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the 
Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank 
compensation and (ii) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, 
the interest rate applicable thereto pursuant to Section 2.06.  If the 
Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative 
Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall 
promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the 
Borrower for such period.  If such Lender pays its share of the applicable 
Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall 
constitute such Lenders Loan included in such Borrowing.  Any payment by 
the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have 
against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the 
Administrative Agent.  A notice from the Administrative Agent to a Lender 
or the Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this subsection (c) 
shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.
 
(c)                                  Failed Loans.  If any Lender shall 
fail to make any Loan (a Failed Loan) which such Lender is otherwise 
obligated hereunder to make to the Borrower on the date of Borrowing 
thereof, and the Administrative Agent shall not have received notice from 
the Borrower or such Lender that any condition precedent to the making of 
the Failed Loan has not been satisfied, then, until such Lender shall have 
made or be deemed to have made (pursuant to the last sentence of this 
subsection (d)) the Failed Loan in full or the Administrative Agent shall 
have received notice from the Borrower or such Lender that any condition 
precedent to the making of the Failed Loan was not satisfied at the time 
the Failed Loan was to have been made, whenever the Administrative Agent 
shall receive any amount from the Borrower for the account of such Lender, 
(i) the amount so received (up to the amount of such Failed Loan) will, 
upon receipt by the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been paid to 
the Lender in satisfaction of the obligation for which paid, without actual 
disbursement of such amount to the Lender, (ii) the Lender will be deemed 
to have made the same amount available to the Administrative Agent for 
disbursement as a Loan to the Borrower (up to the amount of such Failed 
Loan) and (iii) the Administrative Agent will disburse such amount (up to 
the amount of the Failed Loan) to the Borrower or, if the Administrative 
Agent has previously made such amount available to the Borrower on behalf 
of such Lender pursuant to the provisions hereof, reimburse itself (up to 
the amount of the amount made available to the Borrower); provided, 
however, that the Administrative Agent shall have no obligation to disburse 
any such amount to the Borrower, or otherwise apply it or deem it applied 
as provided herein unless the Administrative Agent shall have determined in 
its sole discretion that to so disburse such amount will not violate any 
Law, rule, regulation or requirement applicable to the Administrative 
Agent.  Upon any such disbursement by the Administrative Agent, such Lender 
shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate Loan to the Borrower in 
satisfaction, to the extent thereof, of such Lenders obligation to make 
the Failed Loan.
 
Section 2.04                            Evidence of Loans.  The Loans made 
by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or records 
maintained by such Lender and by the Administrative Agent in the ordinary 
course of business.  The accounts or records maintained by the 
Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be
 
47
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
conclusive absent manifest error of the amount of the Loans made by the 
Lenders to the Borrower and the interest and payments thereon.  Any failure 
to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or 
otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrower hereunder to pay any amount 
owing with respect to the Senior Credit Obligations.  In the event of any 
conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the 
accounts and records of the Administrative Agent in respect of such 
matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control 
in the absence of manifest error.  Upon the request of any Lender made 
through the Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall execute and deliver to 
such Lender (through the Administrative Agent) a single Term Note 
substantially in the form of Exhibit B, payable to such Lender (or its 
registered assigns) in an amount equal to the aggregate unpaid principal 
amount of such Lenders Term Loans, which shall evidence such Lenders 
Loans in addition to such accounts or records.  Each Lender having one or 
more Notes shall record the date, amount, and Type of each Loan made by it 
and the date and amount of each payment of principal made by the Borrower 
with respect thereto, and may, if such Lender so elects in connection with 
any transfer or enforcement of any Note, endorse on the reverse side or on 
the schedule, if any, forming a part thereof appropriate notations to 
evidence the foregoing information with respect to each outstanding Loan 
evidenced thereby; provided that the failure of any Lender to make any such 
recordation or endorsement or any error in any such recordation or 
endorsement shall not affect the obligations of the Borrower hereunder or 
under any such Note.  Each Lender is hereby irrevocably authorized by the 
Borrower so to endorse each of its Notes and to attach to and make a part 
of each of its Notes a continuation of any such schedule as and when 
required.
 
Section 2.05                            [Reserved].
 
Section 2.06                            Interest.
 
(a)                                 Rate Options Applicable to Loans.  Each 
Borrowing shall comprise Base Rate Loans or Eurodollar Loans, as the 
Borrower may request pursuant to Section 2.02.  Borrowings of more than one 
Type may be outstanding at the same time; provided, however, that the 
Borrower may not request any Borrowing that, if made, would result in an 
aggregate of more than ten separate Groups of Eurodollar Loans being 
outstanding hereunder at any one time.  For this purpose, Loans having 
different Interest Periods, regardless of whether commencing on the same 
date, shall be considered separate Groups.  Interest hereunder shall be due 
and payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date; provided that 
interest accruing on past due amounts shall be payable from time to time on 
demand.
 
(b)                                 Rates Applicable to Loans.  Subject to 
the provisions of subsection (c) below, (i) each Eurodollar Loan shall bear 
interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof for each Interest 
Period applicable thereto at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the 
Adjusted Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period plus the then Applicable 
Margin for Eurodollar Loans and (ii) each Base Rate Loan shall bear 
interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof for each day from the 
date such Loan is made as, or converted into, a Base Rate Loan until it 
becomes due or is converted into a Loan of any other Type, at a rate per 
annum equal to the Adjusted Base Rate for such day plus the then Applicable 
Margin for Base Rate Loans.
 
(c)                                  Additional Interest.  Upon the 
occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default under Section 
8.01(a) or (f), all overdue principal, overdue interest, overdue fees and 
other overdue amounts then outstanding under the Loan Documents, from the 
date of such Event of Default until such overdue amount is paid in full or 
until such Event of Default is cured, as applicable, shall bear interest at 
a fluctuating interest rate per annum equal to the Default Rate to the 
fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws.
 
(d)                                 Interest Payments.  Interest on each 
Loan shall be due and payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date 
applicable thereto and at such other times as may be specified herein.  
Interest hereunder shall be due and payable in accordance with the terms 
hereof.  Accrued and unpaid interest at the Default Rate (including 
interest on past due interest) shall be due and payable upon demand.
 
48
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
(e)                                  Determination and Notice of Interest 
Rates.  The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the 
Lenders of the interest rate applicable to any Interest Period for 
Eurodollar Loans upon determination of such interest rate, and shall 
provide to the Borrower an invoice prior to each Interest Payment Date 
setting forth the Administrative Agents calculation of the amount payable 
on such date.  At any time when Base Rate Loans are outstanding, the 
Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders of any 
change in the Prime Rate used in determining the Adjusted Base Rate 
promptly following the public announcement of such change.
 
Section 2.07                            Extension and Conversion.
 
(a)                                 Continuation and Conversion Options.  
The Loans included in each Borrowing shall bear interest initially at the 
type of rate allowed by Section 2.06 and as specified by the Borrower in 
the applicable Notice of Borrowing.  Thereafter, the Borrower shall have 
the option, on any Business Day, to elect to change or continue the type of 
interest rate borne by each Group of Loans (subject in each case to the 
provisions of Article III and Section 2.07(d)), as follows:
 
    (i)                                     if such Loans are Base Rate
    Loans, the Borrower may elect to convert such Loans to Eurodollar Loans
    as of any Business Day; and
     
    (ii)                                  if such Loans are Eurodollar
    Loans, the Borrower may elect to convert such Loans to Base Rate Loans
    or elect to continue such Loans as Eurodollar Loans for an additional
    Interest Period, subject to Section 3.05 in the case of any such
    conversion or continuation effective on any day other than the last day
    of the then current Interest Period applicable to such Loans.
     
Each such election shall be made by delivering a notice, substantially in 
the form of Exhibit A-2 hereto (a Notice of Extension/Conversion) (which 
may be by telephone if promptly confirmed in writing), which notice shall 
not thereafter be revocable by the Borrower, to the Administrative Agent 
not later than 12:00 P.M. on the third Business Day before the conversion 
or continuation selected in such notice is to be effective.  A Notice of 
Extension/Conversion may, if it so specifies, apply to only a portion of 
the aggregate principal amount of the relevant Group of Loans; provided 
that (i) such portion is allocated ratably among the Loans comprising such 
Group and (ii) the portion to which such Notice of Extension/Conversion 
applies, and the remaining portion to which it does not apply, are each 
$500,000 or any larger multiple of $100,000.
 
(b)                                 Contents of Notice of 
Extension/Conversion.  Each Notice of Extension/Conversion shall specify:
     
    (i)                                     the Group of Loans (or portion
    thereof) to which such notice applies;
     
    (ii)                                  the date on which the conversion
    or continuation selected in such notice is to be effective, which shall
    comply with the applicable clause of Section 2.07(a) above;
     
    (iii)                               if the Loans comprising such Group
    are to be converted, the new Type of Loans and, if the Loans being
    converted are to be Eurodollar Loans, the duration of the next
    succeeding Interest Period applicable thereto; and
     
    (iv)                              if such Loans are to be continued as
    Eurodollar Loans for an additional Interest Period, the duration of
    such additional Interest Period.
     
Each Interest Period specified in a Notice of Interest Rate Election shall 
comply with the provisions of the definition of the term Interest Period. 
 If no Notice of Extension/Conversion is timely received prior to the end 
of an Interest Period for any Group of Eurodollar Loans, the Borrower shall 
be deemed to have elected that such Group be continued as Eurodollar Loans 
with an Interest Period of one month as of the last day of such Interest 
Period.
 
49
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
(c)                                  Notification to Lenders.  Upon receipt 
of a Notice of Extension/Conversion from the Borrower pursuant to Section 
2.07(a), the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the 
contents thereof.
 
(d)                                 Limitation on Conversion/Continuation 
Options.  The Borrower shall not be entitled to elect to convert any Loans 
to, or continue any Loans for an additional Interest Period as, Eurodollar 
Loans if the aggregate principal amount of any Group of Eurodollar Loans 
created or continued as a result of such election would be less than 
$500,000.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Event of Default shall have 
occurred and be continuing, the Administrative Agent or the Required 
Lenders may require, by notice to the Borrower, that (i) no outstanding 
Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing and 
(ii) unless repaid, each Eurodollar Borrowing shall be converted to a Base 
Rate Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto.
 
Section 2.08                            Amortization and Maturity of Loans
.
 
(a)                                 Subject to adjustment as a result of 
prior payments in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Borrower 
shall repay, and there shall become due and payable (together with accrued 
interest thereon), on each Principal Amortization Payment Date falling in 
each month listed below the aggregate principal amount of the Term Loans 
indicated opposite such month:

(a)                                 Voluntary Prepayment of Term Loans.  
(i)  The Borrower shall have the right voluntarily to prepay Term Loans in 
whole or in part from time to time, subject to Section 3.05 and Section 
2.09(g) but otherwise without premium or penalty; provided, however, that 
each partial prepayment of Term Loans shall be in a minimum principal 
amount of $1,000,000 or a whole multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof.  
Each payment pursuant to this Section shall be applied as set forth in 
Section 2.09(c)(vii).
 
    (ii)                                  Notwithstanding anything in any
    Loan Document to the contrary, so long as (x) no Default or Event of
    Default has occurred and is continuing and (y) repayments of Term Loans
    pursuant to this Section 2.09(a)(ii) are not funded with the proceeds
    of revolving Indebtedness, the Borrower may prepay the outstanding Term
    Loans, which shall, for the avoidance of doubt, be automatically and
    permanently canceled immediately upon acquisition by the Borrower, and
    which shall be prepaid on the following basis (and no Lender shall be
    obligated to participate in any voluntary prepayment pursuant to this 
    Section 2.09(a)(ii), and each Lenders decision so to participate, or
    not, shall be made in its sole discretion):
     
        (A)                               The Borrower shall have the right
        to make a voluntary prepayment of Term Loans at a discount to par
        pursuant to a Borrower Offer of Specified Discount Prepayment,
        Borrower Solicitation of Discount Range Prepayment Offers or
        Borrower Solicitation of Discounted Prepayment Offers (any such
        prepayment, the Discounted Term Loan Prepayment), in each case
        made in accordance with this Section 2.09(a)(ii); provided that the
        Borrower shall not initiate any action under this Section
        2.09(a)(ii) in order to make a Discounted Term Loan Prepayment
        unless (I) at least ten (10) Business Days shall have passed since
        the consummation of the most recent Discounted Term Loan Prepayment
        as a result of a prepayment made by the Borrower on the applicable
        Discounted Prepayment Effective Date; or (II) at least three (3)
        Business Days shall have passed since the date the Borrower was
        notified that no Term Lender was willing to accept any prepayment
        of any Term Loan at the Specified Discount, within the Discount
        Range or at any discount to par value, as applicable, or in the
        case of Borrower Solicitation of Discounted Prepayment Offers, the
        date of the Borrowers election not to accept any Solicited
        Discounted Prepayment Offers.
         
        (B)                               (1)                              
          Subject to the proviso to subsection (A) above, the Borrower may
        from time to time offer to make a Discounted Term Loan Prepayment
        by providing the Auction Agent with five (5) Business Days notice
        in the form of a Specified Discount Prepayment Notice; provided 
        that (I) any such offer shall be made available, at the sole
        discretion of the Borrower, to (x) each Term Lender and/or (y) each
        Term Lender with respect to any Class of Term Loans on an
        individual Class basis, (II) any such offer shall specify the
        aggregate principal amount offered to be prepaid (the Specified
        Discount Prepayment Amount) with respect to each applicable Class,
        the Class or Classes of Term Loans subject to such offer and the
        specific percentage discount to par (the Specified Discount) of
        such Term Loans to be prepaid (it being understood that different
        Specified Discounts and/or Specified Discount Prepayment Amounts
        may be offered with respect to different Classes of Term Loans and,
        in such event, each such offer will be treated as a separate offer
        pursuant to the terms of this Section 2.09(a)(ii)(B)), (III) the
        Specified Discount Prepayment Amount shall be in an aggregate
        amount not less than $20,000,000 and whole increments of $5,000,000
        in excess thereof (unless otherwise agreed by the Administrative
        Agent) and (IV) each such offer shall remain outstanding through
        the Specified Discount Prepayment Response Date.  The Auction Agent
        will promptly provide each Appropriate Lender with a copy of such
        Specified Discount Prepayment Notice and a form of the Specified
        Discount Prepayment Response to be completed and returned by each
        such Term Lender to the Auction Agent (or its delegate) by no later
        than 5:00 p.m., New York time, on

------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
        the third Business Day after the date of delivery of such notice to
        such Lenders (the Specified Discount Prepayment Response Date).
 
            (2)                                 Each Term Lender receiving
            such offer shall notify the Auction Agent (or its delegate) by
            the Specified Discount Prepayment Response Date whether or not
            it agrees to accept a prepayment of any of its applicable then
            outstanding Term Loans at the Specified Discount and, if so
            (such accepting Lender, a Discount Prepayment Accepting Lender
            ), the amount and the Classes of such Lenders Term Loans to
            be prepaid at such offered discount.  Each acceptance of a
            Discounted Term Loan Prepayment by a Discount Prepayment
            Accepting Lender shall be irrevocable.  Any Term Lender whose
            Specified Discount Prepayment Response is not received by the
            Auction Agent by the Specified Discount Prepayment Response
            Date shall be deemed to have declined the applicable Borrower
            Offer of Specified Discount Prepayment.
             
            (3)                                 If there is at least one
            Discount Prepayment Accepting Lender, the Borrower will make a
            prepayment of outstanding Term Loans pursuant to this paragraph
            (B) to each Discount Prepayment Accepting Lender in accordance
            with the respective outstanding amount and Classes of Term
            Loans specified in such Lenders Specified Discount Prepayment
            Response given pursuant to subsection (2) above; provided 
            that, if the aggregate principal amount of Term Loans accepted
            for prepayment by all Discount Prepayment Accepting Lenders
            exceeds the Specified Discount Prepayment Amount, such
            prepayment shall be made pro rata among the Discount Prepayment
            Accepting Lenders in accordance with the respective principal
            amounts accepted to be prepaid by each such Discount Prepayment
            Accepting Lender and the Auction Agent (in consultation with
            the Borrower and subject to rounding requirements of the
            Auction Agent made in its reasonable discretion) will calculate
            such proration (the Specified Discount Proration).  The
            Auction Agent shall promptly, and in any case within three (3)
            Business Days following the Specified Discount Prepayment
            Response Date, notify (I) the Borrower of the respective Term
            Lenders responses to such offer, the Discounted Prepayment
            Effective Date and the aggregate principal amount of the
            Discounted Term Loan Prepayment and the Classes to be prepaid,
            (II) each Term Lender of the Discounted Prepayment Effective
            Date, and the aggregate principal amount and the Classes of
            Term Loans to be prepaid at the Specified Discount on such date
            and (III) each Discount Prepayment Accepting Lender of the
            Specified Discount Proration, if any, and confirmation of the
            principal amount, Class and Type of Term Loans of such Lender
            to be prepaid at the Specified Discount on such date.  Each
            determination by the Auction Agent of the amounts stated in the
            foregoing notices to the Borrower and such Term Lenders shall
            be conclusive and binding for all purposes absent manifest
            error.  The payment amount specified in such notice to the
            Borrower shall be due and payable by the Borrower on the
            Discounted Prepayment Effective Date in accordance with
            subsection (F) below (subject to subsection (J) below).
             
        (C)                               (1) Subject to the proviso to
        subsection (A) above, the Borrower may from time to time solicit
        Discount Range Prepayment Offers by providing the Auction Agent
        with five (5) Business Days notice in the form of a Discount Range
        Prepayment Notice; provided that (I) any such solicitation shall be
        extended, at the sole discretion of the Borrower, to (x) each Term
        Lender and/or (y) each Term Lender with respect to any Class of
        Term Loans on an individual Class basis, (II) any such notice shall
        specify the maximum aggregate principal amount of the relevant Term
        Loans (the Discount Range Prepayment Amount), the Class or
        Classes of Term Loans subject to such offer and the maximum and
        minimum percentage discounts to par (the Discount Range) of the
        principal amount of such Term

------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
        Loans with respect to each relevant Class of Term Loans willing to
        be prepaid by the Borrower (it being understood that different
        Discount Ranges and/or Discount Range Prepayment Amounts may be
        offered with respect to different Classes of Term Loans and, in
        such event, each such offer will be treated as separate offer
        pursuant to the terms of this Section 2.09(a)(ii)(C)), (III) the
        Discount Range Prepayment Amount shall be in an aggregate amount
        not less than $20,000,000 and whole increments of $5,000,000 in
        excess thereof (unless otherwise agreed by the Administrative
        Agent) and (IV) each such solicitation by the Borrower shall remain
        outstanding through the Discount Range Prepayment Response Date. 
        The Auction Agent will promptly provide each Appropriate Lender
        with a copy of such Discount Range Prepayment Notice and a form of
        the Discount Range Prepayment Offer to be submitted by a responding
        Term Lender to the Auction Agent (or its delegate) by no later than
        5:00 p.m., New York time, on the third Business Day after the date
        of delivery of such notice to such Lenders (the Discount Range
        Prepayment Response Date).  Each Term Lenders Discount Range
        Prepayment Offer shall be irrevocable and shall specify a discount
        to par within the Discount Range (the Submitted Discount) at
        which such Lender is willing to allow prepayment of any or all of
        its then outstanding Term Loans of the applicable Class or Classes
        and the maximum aggregate principal amount and Classes of such
        Lenders Term Loans (the Submitted Amount) such Term Lender is
        willing to have prepaid at the Submitted Discount.  Any Term Lender
        whose Discount Range Prepayment Offer is not received by the
        Auction Agent by the Discount Range Prepayment Response Date shall
        be deemed to have declined to accept a Discounted Term Loan
        Prepayment of any of its Term Loans at any discount to their par
        value within the Discount Range.
 
            (2)                                 The Auction Agent shall
            review all Discount Range Prepayment Offers received on or
            before the applicable Discount Range Prepayment Response Date
            and shall determine (in consultation with the Borrower and
            subject to rounding requirements of the Auction Agent made in
            its sole reasonable discretion) the Applicable Discount and
            Term Loans to be prepaid at such Applicable Discount in
            accordance with this subsection (C).  The Borrower agrees to
            accept on the Discount Range Prepayment Response Date all
            Discount Range Prepayment Offers received by Auction Agent by
            the Discount Range Prepayment Response Date, in the order from
            the Submitted Discount that is the largest discount to par to
            the Submitted Discount that is the smallest discount to par, up
            to and including the Submitted Discount that is the smallest
            discount to par within the Discount Range (such Submitted
            Discount that is the smallest discount to par within the
            Discount Range being referred to as the Applicable Discount)
            which yields a Discounted Term Loan Prepayment in an aggregate
            principal amount equal to the lower of (I) the Discount Range
            Prepayment Amount and (II) the sum of all Submitted Amounts. 
            Each Term Lender that has submitted a Discount Range Prepayment
            Offer to accept prepayment at a discount to par that is larger
            than or equal to the Applicable Discount shall be deemed to
            have irrevocably consented to prepayment of Term Loans equal to
            its Submitted Amount (subject to any required proration
            pursuant to the following subsection (3)) at the Applicable
            Discount (each such Term Lender, a Participating Lender).
             
            (3)                                 If there is at least one
            Participating Lender, the Borrower will prepay the respective
            outstanding Term Loans of each Participating Lender in the
            aggregate principal amount and of the Classes specified in such
            Lenders Discount Range Prepayment Offer at the Applicable
            Discount; provided that if the Submitted Amount by all
            Participating Lenders offered at a discount to par greater than
            the Applicable Discount exceeds the Discount Range Prepayment
            Amount, prepayment of the principal amount of the relevant Term
            Loans for those Participating Lenders whose Submitted Discount
            is a discount to par greater than or equal to the Applicable
 
53
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
            Discount (the Identified Participating Lenders) shall be made
            pro rata among the Identified Participating Lenders in
            accordance with the Submitted Amount of each such Identified
            Participating Lender and the Auction Agent (in consultation
            with the Borrower and subject to rounding requirements of the
            Auction Agent made in its sole reasonable discretion) will
            calculate such proration (the Discount Range Proration).  The
            Auction Agent shall promptly, and in any case within five (5)
            Business Days following the Discount Range Prepayment Response
            Date, notify (I) the Borrower of the respective Term Lenders
            responses to such solicitation, the Discounted Prepayment
            Effective Date, the Applicable Discount, and the aggregate
            principal amount of the Discounted Term Loan Prepayment and the
            Classes to be prepaid, (II) each Term Lender of the Discounted
            Prepayment Effective Date, the Applicable Discount, and the
            aggregate principal amount and Classes of Term Loans to be
            prepaid at the Applicable Discount on such date, (III) each
            Participating Lender of the aggregate principal amount and
            Classes of such Term Lender to be prepaid at the Applicable
            Discount on such date, and (IV) if applicable, each Identified
            Participating Lender of the Discount Range Proration.  Each
            determination by the Auction Agent of the amounts stated in the
            foregoing notices to the Borrower and Term Lenders shall be
            conclusive and binding for all purposes absent manifest error. 
            The payment amount specified in such notice to the Borrower
            shall be due and payable by the Borrower on the Discounted
            Prepayment Effective Date in accordance with subsection (F)
            below (subject to subsection (J) below).
 
        (D)                               (1)                              
          Subject to the proviso to subsection (A) above, the Borrower may
        from time to time solicit Solicited Discounted Prepayment Offers by
        providing the Auction Agent with five (5) Business Days notice in
        the form of a Solicited Discounted Prepayment Notice; provided 
        that (I) any such solicitation shall be extended, at the sole
        discretion of the Borrower, to (x) each Term Lender and/or (y) each
        Lender with respect to any Class of Term Loans on an individual
        Class basis, (II) any such notice shall specify the maximum
        aggregate amount of the Term Loans (the Solicited Discounted
        Prepayment Amount) and the Class or Classes of Term Loans the
        applicable Group Company is willing to prepay at a discount (it
        being understood that different Solicited Discounted Prepayment
        Amounts may be offered with respect to different Classes of Term
        Loans and, in such event, each such offer will be treated as
        separate offer pursuant to the terms of this Section 2.09(a)(ii)(D)
        ), (III) the Solicited Discounted Prepayment Amount shall be in an
        aggregate amount not less than $20,000,000 and whole increments of
        $5,000,000 in excess thereof (unless otherwise agreed by the
        Administrative Agent) and (IV) each such solicitation by the
        Borrower shall remain outstanding through the Solicited Discounted
        Prepayment Response Date.  The Auction Agent will promptly provide
        each Appropriate Lender with a copy of such Solicited Discounted
        Prepayment Notice and a form of the Solicited Discounted Prepayment
        Offer to be submitted by a responding Lender to the Auction Agent

        third Business Day after the date of delivery of such notice to
        such Term Lenders (the Solicited Discounted Prepayment Response
        Date).  Each Term Lenders Solicited Discounted Prepayment Offer
        shall (x) be irrevocable, (y) remain outstanding until the
        Acceptance Date, and (z) specify both a discount to par (the 
        Offered Discount) at which such Term Lender is willing to allow
        prepayment of its then outstanding Term Loan and the maximum
        aggregate principal amount and Classes of such Term Loans (the 
        Offered Amount) such Term Lender is willing to have prepaid at the
        Offered Discount.  Any Term Lender whose Solicited Discounted
        Prepayment Offer is not received by the Auction Agent by the
        Solicited Discounted Prepayment Response Date shall be deemed to
        have declined prepayment of any of its Term Loans at any discount.
         
            (2)                                 The Auction Agent shall
            promptly provide the Borrower with a copy of all Solicited
            Discounted Prepayment Offers received on or before the
 
54
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
            Solicited Discounted Prepayment Response Date.  The Borrower
            shall review all such Solicited Discounted Prepayment Offers
            and select the largest of the Offered Discounts specified by
            the relevant responding Term Lenders in the Solicited
            Discounted Prepayment Offers that is acceptable to the Borrower
            (the Acceptable Discount), if any.  If the Borrower elects to
            accept any Offered Discount as the Acceptable Discount, then as
            soon as practicable after the determination of the Acceptable
            Discount, but in no event later than by the third Business Day
            after the date of receipt by the Borrower from the Auction
            Agent of a copy of all Solicited Discounted Prepayment Offers
            pursuant to the first sentence of this subsection (2) (the 
            Acceptance Date), the Borrower shall submit an Acceptance and
            Prepayment Notice to the Auction Agent setting forth the
            Acceptable Discount.  If the Auction Agent shall fail to
            receive an Acceptance and Prepayment Notice from the Borrower
            by the Acceptance Date, the Borrower shall be deemed to have
            rejected all Solicited Discounted Prepayment Offers.
 
            (3)                                 Based upon the Acceptable
            Discount and the Solicited Discounted Prepayment Offers
            received by Auction Agent by the Solicited Discounted
            Prepayment Response Date, within three (3) Business Days after
            receipt of an Acceptance and Prepayment Notice (the 
            Discounted Prepayment Determination Date), the Auction Agent
            will determine (in consultation with the Borrower and subject
            to rounding requirements of the Auction Agent made in its sole
            reasonable discretion) the aggregate principal amount and the
            Classes of Term Loans (the Acceptable Prepayment Amount) to
            be prepaid by the Borrower at the Acceptable Discount in
            accordance with this Section 2.09(a)(ii)(D).  If the Borrower
            elects to accept any Acceptable Discount, then the Borrower
            agrees to accept all Solicited Discounted Prepayment Offers
            received by Auction Agent by the Solicited Discounted
            Prepayment Response Date, in the order from largest Offered
            Discount to smallest Offered Discount, up to and including the
            Acceptable Discount.  Each Term Lender that has submitted a
            Solicited Discounted Prepayment Offer with an Offered Discount
            that is greater than or equal to the Acceptable Discount shall
            be deemed to have irrevocably consented to prepayment of Term
            Loans equal to its Offered Amount (subject to any required
            pro-rata reduction pursuant to the following sentence) at the
            Acceptable Discount (each such Lender, a Qualifying Lender). 
            The Borrower will prepay outstanding Term Loans pursuant to
            this subsection (D) to each Qualifying Lender in the aggregate
            principal amount and of the Classes specified in such Lenders
            Solicited Discounted Prepayment Offer at the Acceptable
            Discount; provided that if the aggregate Offered Amount by all
            Qualifying Lenders whose Offered Discount is greater than or
            equal to the Acceptable Discount exceeds the Solicited
            Discounted Prepayment Amount, prepayment of the principal
            amount of the Term Loans for those Qualifying Lenders whose
            Offered Discount is greater than or equal to the Acceptable
            Discount (the Identified Qualifying Lenders) shall be made
            pro rata among the Identified Qualifying Lenders in accordance
            with the Offered Amount of each such Identified Qualifying
            Lender and the Auction Agent (in consultation with the Borrower
            and subject to rounding requirements of the Auction Agent made
            in its sole reasonable discretion) will calculate such
            proration (the Solicited Discount Proration).  On or prior to
            the Discounted Prepayment Determination Date, the Auction Agent
            shall promptly notify (I) the Borrower of the Discounted
            Prepayment Effective Date and Acceptable Prepayment Amount
            comprising the Discounted Term Loan Prepayment and the Classes
            to be prepaid, (II) each Term Lender of the Discounted
            Prepayment Effective Date, the Acceptable Discount, and the
            Acceptable Prepayment Amount of all Term Loans and the Classes
            to be prepaid to be prepaid at the Applicable Discount on such
            date, (III) each Qualifying Lender of the aggregate principal
            amount and the Classes of such Term

------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
            Lender to be prepaid at the Acceptable Discount on such date,
            and (IV) if applicable, each Identified Qualifying Lender of
            the Solicited Discount Proration.  Each determination by the
            Auction Agent of the amounts stated in the foregoing notices to
            the Borrower and Term Lenders shall be conclusive and binding
            for all purposes absent manifest error.  The payment amount
            specified in such notice to the Borrower shall be due and
            payable by the Borrower on the Discounted Prepayment Effective
            Date in accordance with subsection (F) below (subject to
            subsection (J) below).
 
        (E)                                In connection with any
        Discounted Term Loan Prepayment, the Borrower and the Term Lenders
        acknowledge and agree that the Auction Agent may require as a
        condition to any Discounted Term Loan Prepayment, the payment of
        customary fees and expenses from the Borrower in connection
        therewith.
         
        (F)                                 If any Term Loan is prepaid in
        accordance with subsections (B) through (D) above, the Borrower
        shall prepay such Term Loans on the Discounted Prepayment Effective
        Date.  The Borrower shall make such prepayment to the
        Administrative Agent, for the account of the Discount Prepayment
        Accepting Lenders, Participating Lenders, or Qualifying Lenders, as
        applicable, at the Administrative Agents Office in immediately
        available funds not later than 12:00 p.m., New York time, on the
        Discounted Prepayment Effective Date and all such prepayments shall
        be applied to the remaining principal installments of the relevant
        Class(es) of Loans on a pro rata basis across such installments. 
        The Term Loans so prepaid shall be accompanied by all accrued and
        unpaid interest on the par principal amount so prepaid up to, but
        not including, the Discounted Prepayment Effective Date.  Each
        prepayment of the outstanding Term Loans pursuant to this Section
        2.09(a)(ii) shall be paid to the Discount Prepayment Accepting
        Lenders, Participating Lenders, or Qualifying Lenders, as
        applicable, and shall be applied to the relevant Term Loans of such
        Lenders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Share or other
        applicable share provided for under this Agreement.  The aggregate
        principal amount of the Classes and installments of the relevant
        Term Loans outstanding shall be deemed reduced by the full par
        value of the aggregate principal amount of the Classes of Term
        Loans prepaid on the Discounted Prepayment Effective Date in any
        Discounted Term Loan Prepayment.  In connection with each
        prepayment pursuant to this Section 2.09(a)(ii), the Borrower shall
        make a customary representation to the assigning or assignee Term
        Lenders, as applicable, that it does not possess material
        non-public information (or, if the Borrower is not at such time a
        publicly-reporting company, material information of the type that
        would not be public if the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries were
        a publicly-reporting company) with respect to the Borrower and its
        Subsidiaries or their respective securities that either (1) has not
        been disclosed to the Term Lenders generally (other than Term
        Lenders that have elected not to receive such information), it
        being understood that documents posted on a U.S. government website
        or on the Borrowers behalf on an Internet or intranet website, if
        any, in each case, to which the Administrative Agent has access
        shall be deemed to have been disclosed to the Term Lenders, or (2)
        if not disclosed to the Term Lenders, would reasonably be expected
        to have a material effect on, or otherwise be material to (A) a
        Term Lenders decision to participate in any such Discounted Term
        Loan Prepayment or (B) the market price of such Term Loans, or
        shall make a statement that such representation cannot be made. 
        The Group Companies hereby waive any right to bring any action
        against the Administrative Agent, in its capacity as such, in
        connection with any such Discounted Term Loan Prepayment.
         
        (G)                               To the extent not expressly
        provided for herein, each Discounted Term Loan Prepayment shall be
        consummated pursuant to procedures consistent with the provisions
        in this Section 2.09(a)(ii), established by the Auction Agent
        acting in its reasonable discretion and as reasonably agreed by the
        Borrower.

        (H)                              Notwithstanding anything in any
        Loan Document to the contrary, for purposes of this Section
        2.09(a)(ii), each notice or other communication required to be
        delivered or otherwise provided to the Auction Agent (or its
        delegate) shall be deemed to have been given upon Auction Agents
        (or its delegates) actual receipt during normal business hours of
        such notice or communication; provided that any notice or
        communication actually received outside of normal business hours
        shall be deemed to have been given as of the opening of business on
        the next Business Day.
         
        (I)                                   Each of the Group Companies
        and the Term Lenders acknowledge and agree that the Auction Agent
        may perform any and all of its duties under this Section
        2.09(a)(ii) by itself or through any Affiliate of the Auction Agent
        and expressly consents to any such delegation of duties by the
        Auction Agent to such Affiliate and the performance of such
        delegated duties by such Affiliate.  The exculpatory provisions
        pursuant to this Agreement shall apply to each Affiliate of the
        Auction Agent and its respective activities in connection with any
        Discounted Term Loan Prepayment provided for in this Section
        2.09(a)(ii) as well as activities of the Auction Agent.
         
        (J)                                   Each Group Company shall have
        the right, by written notice to the Auction Agent, to revoke in
        full (but not in part) its offer to make a Discounted Term Loan
        Prepayment and rescind the applicable Specified Discount Prepayment
        Notice, Discount Range Prepayment Notice or Solicited Discounted
        Prepayment Notice therefor at its discretion at any time on or
        prior to the applicable Specified Discount Prepayment Response Date
        (and if such offer is revoked pursuant to the preceding clauses,
        any failure by the Borrower to make any prepayment to a Lender, as
        applicable, pursuant to this Section 2.09(a)(ii) shall not
        constitute a Default or Event of Default under Section 8.01 or
        otherwise).
         
(b)                                 [Reserved].
 
(c)                                  Mandatory Prepayments; Application of 
Prepayments.
 
    (i)                                     [Reserved].
     
    (ii)                                  Excess Cash Flow.  No later than
    95 days after the end of each Excess Cash Flow Period, the Borrower
    shall prepay (or cause to be prepaid) the Term Loans in an amount equal
    to (A) the Applicable ECF Percentage of Excess Cash Flow for such
    Excess Cash Flow Period minus (B) the aggregate amount of all voluntary
    prepayments of principal of the Term Loans and the Incremental Term
    Loans and any Incremental Revolving Loans, in each case that are not
    funded with the proceeds of long-term Indebtedness (which, in the case
    of Discounted Term Loan Prepayments, will be limited to the actual
    amount of cash paid to Lenders in connection with such prepayment (as
    opposed to the face amount of the Loans so prepaid)) (but, in the case
    of Incremental Revolving Loans, only to the extent the Incremental
    Revolving Commitments are permanently reduced at the time of such
    payment of Incremental Revolving Loans), if such voluntary prepayments
    are made (x) during such Excess Cash Flow Period and have not
    previously reduced the amount of any prepayment pursuant to this clause
    (ii) or, (y) at the election of the Borrower, after the last day of
    such Excess Cash Flow Period and prior to the date of prepayment (with
    any prepayment pursuant to Section 2.09(a)(ii) being measured by the
    amount applied to such prepayment, rather than the amount by which the
    outstanding principal amount of the Term Loans is reduced thereby).  As
    used in this Section 2.09(c)(ii), the term Applicable ECF Percentage
    for any Excess Cash Flow Period means 75%; provided that, for any
    Excess Cash Flow Period ending on or after December 31, 2017, the
    Applicable ECF Percentage shall be reduced to (i) 50% if the Total Net
    Leverage Ratio as of the last day of and for such Excess Cash Flow
    Period is less than or equal to 2.00 to 1.00 but greater than 1.00 to
    1.00, (ii) 25% if the Total Net Leverage Ratio as of the last day of
    and for such Excess Cash Flow Period is less than or equal to 1.00
 
57
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
    to 1.00 but greater than 0.50 to 1.00 and (iii) 0% if the Total Net
    Leverage Ratio as of the last day of and for such Excess Cash Flow
    Period is less than or equal to 0.50 to 1.00.
 
    (iii)                               Asset Dispositions, Casualties and
    Condemnations, etc.  Within five Business Days after receipt by the
    Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries of Net Cash Proceeds from any Asset
    Disposition not in the ordinary course of business (other than any
    Asset Disposition permitted under clauses (i) through (xiii) or (xv) of 
    Section 7.05), Casualty or Condemnation (in each case, excluding Net
    Cash Proceeds to the extent and so long as they constitute Reinvestment
    Funds), the Borrower shall prepay (or cause to be prepaid) the Term
    Loans in an aggregate amount equal to 100% of the Net Cash Proceeds of
    such Asset Disposition, Casualty or Condemnation; provided that no such
    prepayment caused by the receipt of Net Cash Proceeds from any Asset
    Disposition, Casualty or Condemnation shall be required to the extent
    that the sum of such Net Cash Proceeds and all other Net Cash Proceeds
    from Asset Dispositions, Casualties or Condemnations (other than an
    Asset Disposition permitted under clauses (i) through (xiii) or (xv) of 
    Section 7.05)) occurring after the Closing Date and during the same
    fiscal year does not exceed $3,000,000 (it being understood that a
    prepayment shall only be required of such excess).
     
    (iv)                              Debt Issuances.  Within three
    Business Days after receipt by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries
    of Net Cash Proceeds from any Debt Issuance (other than any Debt
    Issuance permitted pursuant to Section 7.01 of this Agreement (other
    than subsection (vi) thereof, to the extent not applied in connection
    with the related Permitted Refinancing)) the Borrower shall prepay (or
    cause to be prepaid) the Term Loans in an aggregate amount equal to
    100% of the Net Cash Proceeds of such Debt Issuance.
     
    (v)                                 Notwithstanding any other
    provisions of this Section 2.09(c), (A) to the extent that any or all
    of the Net Cash Proceeds of any Asset Disposition by a Foreign
    Subsidiary giving rise to a prepayment event pursuant to Section
    2.09(c)(iii) (a Foreign Disposition), the Net Cash Proceeds of any
    Casualty Event from a Foreign Subsidiary giving rise to a prepayment
    event pursuant to Section 2.09(c)(iii) (a Foreign Casualty Event),
    the Net Cash Proceeds of any Condemnation Award from a Foreign
    Subsidiary giving rise to a prepayment event pursuant to Section
    2.09(c)(iii) (a Foreign Condemnation Award), or Excess Cash Flow are
    prohibited or delayed by applicable local Law (including financial
    assistance and corporate benefit Laws or Laws relating to fiduciary and
    statutory duties of directors and officers) or restricted by applicable
    Organization Documents (so long as such restriction is in effect on the
    Closing Date or the date, if later, upon which such Foreign Subsidiary
    becomes a Subsidiary and was not effected in contemplation of this 
    subsection(b)(v)) from being repatriated to the United States, the
    Borrower shall not be required to make a prepayment at the time
    provided in this Section 2.09(c), and instead, such amounts may be
    retained by the applicable Foreign Subsidiary (the Borrower hereby
    agreeing to use reasonable efforts to otherwise cause the applicable
    Foreign Subsidiary following the date on which the respective payment
    would otherwise have been required, promptly to take all actions
    reasonably required by the applicable local law, applicable
    organizational or constitutive impediment or other impediment to permit
    such repatriation), and if following the date on which the respective
    payment would otherwise have been required, such repatriation of any of
    such affected Net Cash Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow is permitted under
    the applicable local law, applicable organizational or constitutive
    impediment or other impediment, such repatriation will be promptly
    effected and such repatriated Net Cash Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow
    will be promptly (and in any event not later than three Business Days
    after such repatriation could be made) applied (whether or not
    repatriation actually occurs) to the repayment of the Term Loans
    pursuant to this Section 2.09 to the extent provided herein and (B) to
    the extent that the Borrower has determined in good faith that
    repatriation of any of or all the Net Cash Proceeds of any Foreign
    Disposition, any Foreign Casualty Event, Foreign Condemnation Award or
    Excess Cash Flow would have a material adverse U.S. Tax cost
    consequence (taking into account any foreign tax credit or benefit
    actually realized in connection with such repatriation) with respect to
    such Net Cash Proceeds
 
58
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
    or Excess Cash Flow, the Net Cash Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow so
    affected may be retained by the applicable Foreign Subsidiary.
 
    (vi)                              Application of Mandatory Prepayments
    .  All amounts required to be paid pursuant to this Section 2.09(c)
    shall be applied pro rata to the outstanding Term Loans and, if
    applicable Incremental Term Loans, in each case to the remaining unpaid
    Principal Amortization Payments in direct order of maturity.
     
    (vii)                           Order of Application for Voluntary
    Prepayments.  All amounts allocated to the voluntary prepayment of the
    Term Loans shall be applied as directed by the Borrower at the time of
    the respective prepayment (or, in the absence of such direction, in
    direct order of maturity to the remaining unpaid Principal Amortization
    Payments).  Within the parameters of the applications set forth above,
    prepayments shall be applied first to Base Rate Loans and then to
    Eurodollar Loans in direct order of Interest Period maturities.  All
    prepayments of Eurodollar Loans under this Section 2.09(c) shall be
    subject to Section 3.05.
     
    (viii)                        Payments Cumulative.  Except as otherwise
    expressly provided in this Section 2.09, payments required under any
    subsection or clause of this Section 2.09 are in addition to payments
    made or required under any other subsection or clause of this Section
    2.09.
     
(d)                                 Notice of Mandatory Prepayment Events.  
The Borrower shall give to the Administrative Agent at least three Business 
Days prior written or telecopy notice of each and every prepayment 
required under Sections 2.09(c)(iii) and (iv), including a good faith 
estimate of (x) the amount of Net Cash Proceeds expected to be received 
therefrom and (y) the expected schedule for receiving such proceeds.
 
(e)                                  Notices of Prepayments.  The Borrower 
shall notify the Administrative Agent, in the case of prepayment of a Base 
Rate Loan, by 11:00 A.M. at least one Business Day prior to the date of any 
voluntary prepayment hereunder and, in the case of prepayment of a 
Eurodollar Loan, by 11:00 A.M., at least three Business Days prior to the 
date of voluntary prepayment.  Each notice of prepayment shall specify the 
prepayment date, the principal amount to be prepaid, whether the Loan to be 
prepaid is a Eurodollar Loan or a Base Rate Loan and, in the case of a 
Eurodollar Loan, the Interest Period of such Loan.  The Administrative 
Agent will promptly notify each Lender of its receipt of each such notice, 
and of the amount of such Lenders pro rata share, if any, thereof.  Once 
such notice is given by the Borrower, the Borrower shall make such 
prepayment and the payment amount specified in such notice shall be due and 
payable as specified therein; provided, however, that for voluntary 
prepayments under Section 2.09(a) or (b) the Borrower shall be entitled to 
make any such payment conditional on the receipt of other financing or the 
closing of another transaction to the extent specified in such notice.  All 
prepayments of Eurodollar Loans under this Section 2.09 shall be 
accompanied by accrued interest on the principal amount being prepaid to 
the date of payment, together with any additional amounts required pursuant 
to Section 3.05.
 
(f)                                   In the event of any prepayment of any 
Term Loans of any Term Lender pursuant to Section 2.09(c)(ii), (c)(iii) or 
(c)(iv) (an Applicable Prepayment), such Lender may reject all or a 
portion of its share of such Applicable Prepayment by written notice (each, 
a Rejection Notice) to the Administrative Agent no later than 5:00 P.M. 
one Business Day after the date of such Term Lenders receipt of notice of 
such Applicable Prepayment as otherwise provided herein (the Rejection 
Deadline).  If a Term Lender fails to deliver a Rejection Notice to the 
Administrative Agent at or prior to the Rejection Deadline, such Term 
Lender will be deemed to have accepted its share of the Applicable 
Prepayment.  The aggregate portion of such Applicable Prepayment that is 
rejected by Term Lenders pursuant to Rejection Notices shall be referred to 
as the Rejected Amount.  Such Rejected Amount shall be returned by the 
Administrative Agent to the Borrower and may be used by the Borrower in any 
manner not prohibited by the Loan Documents.
 
(g)                                  Loan Call Protection.  (i)  Any 
prepayment with respect to all or any portion of the Term Loans under 
Section 2.09(a) or Section 2.09(c)(iii) or (iv), in each case other than in 
connection with the
 
59
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
occurrence of a Change of Control, shall be accompanied by a prepayment 
premium equal to (A) 2.0% of the principal amount of such prepayment, if 
such prepayment is made on or prior to the date that is twelve months after 
the Closing Date or (B) 1.0% of the principal amount of such prepayment, if 
such prepayment is made after the date that is twelve months after the 
Closing Date and on or prior to the date that is twenty-four months after 
the Closing Date.
 
Section 2.10                            Termination of Commitments.  The 
Term Commitments shall terminate immediately upon the making of the Term 
Loans on the Closing Date.
 
Section 2.11                            Fees.  The Borrower shall pay to 
the Lead Arranger and the Administrative Agent for their own respective 
accounts fees in the amounts and at the times specified in the Fee Letter.  
Certain of such fees may be paid by funding the Term Loans at an original 
issue discount.  Such fees shall be fully earned when paid and shall not be 
refundable for any reason whatsoever.  The Borrower shall pay to the 
Lenders such fees as shall have been separately agreed upon in writing in 
the amounts and at the times so specified.
 
Section 2.12                            Pro Rata Treatment.  Except to the 
extent otherwise provided herein, each Borrowing, each payment or 
prepayment of principal of or interest on any Loan, each payment of fees 
(other than fees retained by the Agents and Lead Arranger for their own 
account), and each conversion or continuation of any Loan, shall be 
allocated pro rata among the relevant Lenders in accordance with the 
respective Applicable Percentages, Incremental Revolving Commitment 
Percentages and Incremental Term Loan Commitment Percentages, as 
applicable, of such Lenders (or, if the Commitments of such Lenders have 
expired or been terminated, in accordance with the respective principal 
amounts of the outstanding Loans of the applicable Class of such Lenders); 
provided that, in the event any amount paid to any Lender pursuant to this 
subsection (a) is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by the 
Administrative Agent, each Lender shall, upon the request of the 
Administrative Agent, repay to the Administrative Agent the amount so paid 
to such Lender, with interest for the period commencing on the date such 
payment is returned by the Administrative Agent until the date the 
Administrative Agent receives such repayment at a rate per annum equal to 
the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by 
the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on 
interbank compensation.
 
Section 2.13                            Sharing of Payments by Lenders.
 
If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or 
otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any 
of the Loans made by it resulting in such Lenders receiving payment of a 
proportion of the aggregate amount of such Loans and accrued interest 
thereon greater than its pro rata share thereof as provided herein, then 
the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (i) notify the 
Administrative Agent of such fact, and (ii) purchase (for cash at face 
value) participations in the Loans of the other Lenders, or make such other 
adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments 
shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate 
amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans and 
other amounts owing thereon; provided that:
     
    (i)                                     if any such participations or
    subparticipations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment
    giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations or
    subparticipations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to
    the extent of such recovery, without interest; and
     
    (ii)                                  the provisions of this Section
    shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by or on behalf
    of the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of
    this Agreement (including the application of funds arising from the
    existence of a Defaulting Lender) or (y) any payment obtained by a
    Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a
    participation in any of its Loans to any assignee or participant, other
    than an assignment to the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof (as to
    which the provisions of this Section shall apply).
 
60
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Each Loan Party consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may 
effectively do so under applicable Law, that any Lender acquiring a 
participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against 
such Loan Party rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such 
participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such 
Loan Party in the amount of such participation.
 
Section 2.14                            Payments Generally; Administrative 
Agents Clawback.
 
(a)                                 Payments by the Borrower.  All payments 
to be made by the Borrower shall be made without condition or deduction for 
any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff.  Each payment of principal 
of and interest on Loans and fees hereunder shall be paid not later than 
12:00 P.M. on the date when due, in Dollars and in Federal or other funds 
immediately available to the Administrative Agent at the account designated 
by it by notice to the Borrower.  Payments received after 12:00 P.M. shall 
be deemed to have been received on the next Business Day, and any 
applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue.  The Administrative 
Agent shall distribute such payments to the applicable Lenders promptly 
following receipt thereof.  Whenever any payment hereunder shall be due on 
a day which is not a Business Day, the date for payment thereof shall be 
extended to the next succeeding Business Day (and such extension of time 
shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be), 
unless (in the case of Eurodollar Loans) such Business Day falls in another 
calendar month, in which case the date for payment thereof shall be the 
next preceding Business Day.  If the date for any payment of principal is 
extended by operation of Law or otherwise, interest thereon shall be 
payable for such extended time.
 
(b)                                 Presumption by the Administrative Agent
.  Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice (which may be 
by telephone if promptly confirmed in writing) from the Borrower prior to 
the date on which any payment is due to the applicable Lenders hereunder 
that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may 
assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance 
herewith, and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the 
applicable Lenders the amount due.  In such event, if the Borrower has not 
in fact made such payment, then each of the applicable Lenders severally 
agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount 
so distributed to such Lender in immediately available funds with interest 
thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is 
distributed to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative 
Agent at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate 
determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry 
rules on interbank compensation.  A notice of the Administrative Agent to 
any Lender with respect to any amount owing under this subsection (b) shall 
be conclusive, absent manifest error.
 
(c)                                  Failure to Satisfy Conditions 
Precedent.  If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds 
for any Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing 
provisions of this Article II, and such funds are not made available to the 
Borrower by the Administrative Agent because the conditions to the 
applicable Borrowing set forth in Article IV are not satisfied or waived in 
accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall return 
such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender 
without interest.
 
(d)                                 Obligations of Lenders Several.  The 
obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Loans are several and not 
joint.  The failure of any Lender to make a Loan required to be made by it 
as part of any Borrowing hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of 
its obligation, if any, hereunder to make any Loan on the date of such 
Borrowing, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other 
Lender to make the Loan to be made by such other Lender on such date of 
Borrowing.
 
(e)                                  Funding Source.  Nothing herein shall 
be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any 
particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender 
that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any 
particular place or manner.
 
(f)                                   Computations.  All computations of 
interest for Base Rate Loans when the Adjusted Base Rate is determined by 
the Prime Rate shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as 
the case may
 
61
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
be, and actual days elapsed.  All other computations of fees and interest 
shall be made on the basis of a 360-day year and actual days elapsed (which 
results in more fees or interest, as applicable, being paid than if 
computed on the basis of a 365-day year).  Interest shall accrue on each 
Loan for the day on which Loan is made (or converted or continued), and 
shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which 
the Loan or such portion is paid, provided that any Loan that is repaid on 
the same day on which it is made (or continued or converted) shall, subject 
to subsection (a) above, bear interest for one day.  Each determination by 
the Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be 
conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.
 
Section 2.15                            Increase in Commitments.
 
(a)                                 Borrower Request.  At any time after 
the later of (A) the Closing Date and (B) the earlier of (x) the completion 
of a Successful Syndication (as defined in the Fee Letter) and (y) 60 days 
after the Closing Date, the Borrower may by written notice to the 
Administrative Agent elect to request the establishment of (i) one or more 
new Term Commitments or increases in the amount of the Term Commitments 
(each, an Incremental Term Loan Commitment and loans pursuant thereto 
Incremental Term Loans) or (ii) revolving commitments under a revolving 
credit facility including, at the Borrowers election and with the 
Administrative Agents approval (not to be unreasonably withheld or 
conditioned), subfacilities for swing line loans and letters of credit (a 
Revolving Credit Facility) or increases in the amount of the revolving 
commitments in respect of a Revolving Credit Facility (each, an 
Incremental Revolving Commitment and loans pursuant thereto Incremental 
Revolving Loans and, collectively with the Incremental Term Loans, 
Incremental Loans), by an amount not in excess of the Incremental Total 
Cap in the aggregate and not less than $5,000,000 individually or any 
larger multiple of $1,000,000.  Each such notice shall specify (x) the date 
(each, an Increase Effective Date) on which the Borrower proposes that 
the increased or new Commitments shall be effective, which shall be a date 
not less than five Business Days (or such lesser period as may be consented 
to by the Administrative Agent) after the date on which such notice is 
delivered to the Administrative Agent and (y) the identity of each Eligible 
Assignee to whom the Borrower proposes any portion of such increased or new 
Commitments be allocated and the amounts of such allocations; provided 
that any existing Lender approached to provide all or a portion of the 
increased or new Commitments may elect or decline, in its sole discretion, 
to provide such increased or new Commitment; provided further that the 
consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) of the 
Administrative Agent with respect to the Persons providing such Incremental 
Loans, Incremental Term Loan Commitments or Incremental Revolving 
Commitments shall be required.
 
(b)                                 Conditions.  The increased or new 
Commitments shall become effective as of the Increase Effective Date; 
provided that:
 
    (i)                                     both before and immediately
    after giving effect to any Incremental Loans, each of the conditions
    set forth in Section 4.02 shall be satisfied, subject to customary
    SunGard limitations to the extent the proceeds of any such
    Incremental Loans are used to finance a Permitted Acquisition;
     
    (ii)                                  no Event of Default shall have
    occurred and be continuing or would result from the Borrowing to be
    made on the Increase Effective Date, subject to customary SunGard
    limitations to the extent the proceeds of any Incremental Loans are
    used to finance a Permitted Acquisition;
     
    (iii)                               after giving effect to such
    Incremental Term Commitments, Incremental Revolving Commitments and
    Incremental Loans and the application of the proceeds thereof, and
    assuming that all Incremental Revolving Commitments are borrowed in
    full, the Total Net Leverage Ratio, determined on a Pro Forma Basis
    (without netting any proceeds of Incremental Loans) for and as of the
    last day of the most recent period of four consecutive fiscal quarters
    for which financial statements have been delivered under Section
    6.01(a) or (b) hereof (or, prior to the first date of delivery of such
    financial statements, as of the period of four consecutive fiscal
    quarters ending on September 30,
 
62
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
    2014, shall not be greater than the lesser of (A) the maximum ratio
    permitted under Section 7.15 as of the last day of the most recently
    ended Test Period and (B) 4.20 : 1.00; and
 
    (iv)                              the Borrower shall deliver or cause
    to be delivered a certificate of a Responsible Officer certifying
    compliance with the foregoing conditions.
     
(c)                                  Terms of New Loans and Commitments.  
The terms and provisions of Loans made pursuant to the new Commitments 
shall be as follows:
 
    (i)                                     terms and provisions of (A)
    Incremental Revolving Commitments and Incremental Revolving Loans shall
    be, except as otherwise set forth herein, (i) in the case of
    Incremental Revolving Commitments or Incremental Revolving Loans
    establishing the initial Revolving Credit Facility, on terms and
    conditions identical to those of the Term Loans, provided that the
    provisions of this Article II and Articles IV, VII, IX, and X, and
    defined terms relating thereto, shall be amended by the Borrower and
    the Administrative Agent to incorporate provisions reasonably
    satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower and customary
    for revolving credit facilities, including, without limitation, (1)
    extensions of the maturity date of the Incremental Revolving
    Commitments on terms consistent with Section 2.16, (2) customary
    provisions relating to borrowing procedures and requirements, (3)
    customary differences with respect to assignments and participations,
    (4) customary voting and approval rights of any letter of credit issuer
    or swing line lender, (5) defaulting lender and cash
    collateralization requirements customary for revolving credit
    facilities (and letter of credit and swingline sub-facilities) and (6)
    application of proceeds of voluntary and mandatory prepayments (which
    shall, in the case of mandatory prepayments, require the prepayment in
    full of all Term Loans and Incremental Term Loans prior to the
    application of mandatory prepayments to the Revolving Credit Facility
    and any extensions of credit thereunder) and conforming amendments
    shall be effected to the terms hereof by the Borrower and the
    Administrative Agent, in each case without the consent of any other
    Lender, and (ii) in the case of subsequent Incremental Revolving
    Commitments and Incremental Loans, identical to the Incremental
    Revolving Commitments and Incremental Revolving Loans, respectively,
    under the initial Revolving Credit Facility and (B) Incremental Term
    Loans shall be, except as otherwise set forth herein or in the Increase
    Amendment, identical to the Term Loans (it being understood that
    Incremental Term Loans may be a part of the Term Loans) or otherwise
    reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent;
     
    (ii)                                  the Applicable Margins and fees
    for the Incremental Loans and any commitment fees or letter of credit
    fees in respect of any Incremental Revolving Commitments shall be
    determined by the Borrower and the Lenders of the Incremental Loans; 
    provided that, if the Applicable Margins (or similar measure of
    interest margin) for any Incremental Term Loans are more than 0.50% per
    annum higher than the Applicable Margins for the Term Loans, then the
    Applicable Margins for the Term Loans shall be increased to the extent
    necessary so that the Applicable Margins (or similar measure of
    interest margin) for the Term Loans are equal to the Applicable Margins
    for the Incremental Term Loans minus 0.50%; provided, further, that in
    determining the Applicable Margins applicable to the Term Loans and the
    Incremental Term Loans, (x) original issue discount (OID) or upfront
    fees shall be included (with OID being equated to interest based on an
    assumed four year life to maturity) and (y) customary arrangement or
    underwriting fees not payable to all Lenders in connection with the
    Term Loans or the Incremental Term Loans shall be excluded;
     
    (iii)                               the weighted average life to
    maturity of any Incremental Term Loans shall be no shorter than the
    weighted average life to maturity of the existing Term Loans and the
    maturity date of Incremental Term Loans shall not be earlier than the
    Maturity Date applicable to the Term Loans.  The Incremental Loans
    shall share ratably with the Term Loans with respect to Guaranty,
    Collateral and, except as set forth above with respect to mandatory
    prepayments,  mandatory prepayments and other payment rights; and
 
63
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
    (iv)                              to the extent not otherwise
    consistent with this Agreement, documentation in respect of the
    Incremental Revolving Loans and Incremental Term Loans shall be
    otherwise reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
     
The Incremental Term Loan Commitments and the Incremental Revolving 
Commitments shall be effected by an amendment and, if applicable, joinder 
agreement (the Increase Amendment) executed by the Borrower, the 
Administrative Agent and each Lender making such Incremental Term Loan 
Commitment or Incremental Revolving Commitment, as applicable, in form and 
substance satisfactory to each of them.  The Increase Amendment may, 
without the consent of any other Lenders, effect such amendments to this 
Agreement and the other Loan Documents as may be necessary or appropriate, 
in the opinion of the Administrative Agent, to effect the provisions of 
this Section 2.15 and may constitute an amendment and restatement of this 
Agreement.  In addition, unless otherwise specifically provided herein, all 
references in Loan Documents to Term Loans shall be deemed to include 
references to Incremental Term Loans made pursuant to this Agreement.
 
(d)                                 Effectiveness.  On any Increase 
Effective Date on which new Commitments for Term Loans are effective, 
subject to the satisfaction of the foregoing terms and conditions, each 
Lender of such new Commitment shall make a Term Loan to the Borrower in an 
amount equal to its Incremental Term Commitment or establish its 
Incremental Revolving Commitment in favor of the Borrower.
 
(e)                                  Equal and Ratable Benefit.  The Loans 
and Commitments established pursuant to this paragraph shall constitute 
Loans and Commitments under, and shall be entitled to all the benefits 
afforded by, this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and shall, 
without limiting the foregoing, benefit equally and ratably from the 
Guaranty and security interests created by the Collateral Documents.  The 
Loan Parties shall take any actions reasonably required by the 
Administrative Agent to ensure and/or demonstrate that the Lien and 
security interests granted by the Collateral Documents continue to be 
perfected under the UCC or otherwise after giving effect to the 
establishment of any such Class of Loans or any such new Commitments.
 
Section 2.16                            Extensions of Term Loans.
 
(a)                                 Notwithstanding anything to the 
contrary in this Agreement, pursuant to one or more offers (each, an 
Extension Offer) made from time to time by the Borrower to all Lenders of 
Terms Loans with a like maturity date, on a pro rata basis (based on the 
aggregate outstanding principal amount of the respective Term Loans with a 
like maturity date) and on the same terms to each such Lender, the Borrower 
is hereby permitted to consummate from time to time transactions with 
individual Lenders that accept the terms contained in such Extension Offers 
to extend the maturity date of each such Lenders Term Loans and otherwise 
modify the terms of such Term Loans pursuant to the terms of the relevant 
Extension Offer (including, without limitation, by increasing the interest 
rate or fees payable in respect of such Term Loans and/or modifying the 
amortization schedule in respect of such Lenders Term Loans) (each, an 
Extension, and each group of Term Loans, in each case as so extended, as 
well as the original Term Loans (not so extended), being a separate Class, 
any Extended Terms Loans shall constitute a separate Class of Term Loans 
from the Class of Term Loans from which they were converted, so long as the 
following terms are satisfied (it being understood that no such Lender 
shall have any obligation to commit to any such Extension):
 
    (i)                                     [Reserved];
     
    (ii)                                  except as to interest rates,
    fees, premiums, amortization, final maturity date, optional prepayment
    terms, mandatory prepayment dates and participation in prepayments
    (which shall, subject to the immediately succeeding clauses (iv), (v)
    and (vi), be determined by the Borrower and set forth in reasonable
    detail in the relevant Extension Offer), the Term Loans, as the case
    may be, of any Term Loan Lender that agrees to an Extension with
    respect to such Term Loans (an Extending Term Loan Lender) extended
    pursuant to any Extension (Extended Term Loans), shall have terms
    applicable prior to the original Term Loan Maturity Date, as the case
    may be, no more favorable in any material
 
64
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
    respect, taken as a whole, to the Extending Term Loan Lender than the
    terms of the Class of Term Loans subject to such Extension Offer;
 
    (iii)                               the final maturity date of any
    Extended Term Loans shall be no earlier than the Term Loan Maturity
    Date;
     
    (iv)                              the weighted average life of any
    Extended Term Loans shall be no shorter than the remaining weighted
    average life of the Term Loans extended thereby, and, prior to the
    originally scheduled Maturity Date, such Extended Term Loans do not
    require scheduled principal payments of greater than 2.50% of the
    original amount thereof in any calendar quarter ending on or prior to
    December 31, 2015, or 3.75% of the original principal amount thereof in
    any calendar quarter thereafter;
     
    (v)                                 any Extended Term Loans may
    participate on a pro rata basis or a less than pro rata basis (but not
    greater than a pro rata basis) in any voluntary or mandatory repayments
    or prepayments hereunder, in each case as specified in the respective
    Extension Offer;
     
    (vi)                              if the aggregate principal amount of
    Term Loans (calculated on the face amount thereof) in respect of which
    Term Lenders shall have accepted the relevant Extension Offer shall
    exceed the maximum aggregate principal amount of Term Loans offered to
    be extended by the Borrower pursuant to such Extension Offer, then the
    Term Loans of such Term Lenders shall be extended ratably up to such
    maximum amount based on the respective principal amounts (but not to
    exceed actual the Borrower of record) with respect to which such Term
    Loan Lenders have accepted such Extension Offer;
     
    (vii)                           all documentation in respect of such
    Extension shall be consistent with the foregoing; and
     
    (viii)                        any applicable Minimum Extension
    Condition shall be satisfied unless waived by the Borrower.
     
(b)                                 With respect to all Extensions 
consummated by the Borrower pursuant to this Section, (i) such Extensions 
shall not constitute voluntary or mandatory payments or prepayments for 
purposes of Section 2.09 and (ii) no Extension Offer is required to be in 
any minimum amount or any minimum increment, provided that the Borrower may 
at its election specify as a condition (a Minimum Extension Condition) to 
consummating any such Extension that a minimum amount (to be determined and 
specified in the relevant Extension Offer in the Borrowers sole discretion 
and may be waived by the Borrower) of Term Loans of any or all applicable 
Classes be tendered.  The Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereby 
consent to the Extensions and the other transactions contemplated by this 
Section 2.16 (including, for the avoidance of doubt, payment of any 
interest, fees or premium in respect of any Extended Term Loans on such 
terms as may be set forth in the relevant Extension Offer) and hereby waive 
the requirements of any provision of this Agreement (including, without 
limitation, Section 2.12 or any other pro rata payment section) or any 
other Loan Documents that may otherwise prohibit or restrict any such 
Extension or any other transaction contemplated by this Section 2.16.
 
(c)                                  No consent of any Lender or any Agent 
shall be required to effectuate any Extension, other than the consent of 
each Lender agreeing to such Extension with respect to one or more of its 
Term Loans (or a portion thereof).  All Extended Term Loans and all 
obligations in respect thereof shall be Obligations under this Agreement 
and the other Loan Documents that are secured by the Collateral on a pari 
passu basis with all other applicable Obligations under this Agreement and 
the other Loan Documents.  The Lenders hereby irrevocably authorize the 
Administrative Agent and, to the extent applicable, the Collateral Agent, 
to enter into amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents 
with the Borrower and other Loan Parties as may be necessary in order to 
establish new Classes in respect of Term Loans so extended and such 
technical
 
65
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
amendments as may be necessary or appropriate in the reasonable opinion of 
the Administrative Agent and the Borrower in connection with the 
establishment of such new Classes, in each case on terms consistent with 
this Section 2.16.
 
(d)                                 In connection with any Extension, the 
Borrower shall provide the Administrative Agent at least 10 Business Days 
(or such shorter period as may be agreed by the Administrative Agent) prior 
written notice thereof and shall agree to such procedures (to ensure 
reasonable administrative management of the Loans and Commitments hereunder 
after such Extension), if any, as may be established by, or acceptable to, 
the Administrative Agent, in each case acting reasonably to accomplish the 
purposes of this Section 2.16.
 
(e)                                  This Section 2.16 shall supersede any 
provisions in Section 2.12, Section 2.13, Section 2.14 or Section 10.01 to 
the contrary.
 
Section 2.17                            [Reserved].
 
Section 2.18                            Defaulting Lenders.
 
(a)                                 Adjustments.  Notwithstanding anything 
to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a 
Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as that Lender is no longer a 
Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable Law:
 
    (i)                                     Waivers and Amendments.  Such
    Defaulting Lenders right to approve or disapprove any amendment,
    waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as
    set forth in Section 10.01.
     
    (ii)                                  Reallocation of Payments.  Any
    payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the
    Administrative Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender (whether
    voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Article VIII or
    otherwise, and including any amounts made available to the
    Administrative Agent by such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section
    10.08), shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by
    the Administrative Agent as follows:  first, to the payment of any
    amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent
    hereunder; second, as the Borrower may request (so long as no Default
    or Event of Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of
    which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as
    required by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent; 
    third, if so determined by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower,
    to be held in a non-interest bearing deposit account and released pro
    rata in order to satisfy such Defaulting Lenders potential future
    funding obligations with respect to Loans under this Agreement; fourth
    , to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders as a result of any
    judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender
    against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lenders
    breach of its obligations under this Agreement; fifth, so long as no
    Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing
    to the Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent
    jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against such Defaulting Lender as
    a result of such Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under
    this Agreement; and sixth, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise
    directed by a court of competent jurisdiction. Any payments,
    prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender
    that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender
    shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and
    each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.
 
(b)                                 Defaulting Lender Cure.  If the 
Borrower and the Administrative Agent agree in writing in their sole 
discretion that a Defaulting Lender should no longer be deemed to be a 
Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties 
hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and 
subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements 
with respect to any Cash Collateral), such Lender will, to the extent 
applicable, purchase at par that portion of outstanding Loans
 
66
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent 
may determine to be necessary to cause the Loans to be held on a pro rata 
basis by the Lenders in accordance with their Applicable Percentages, 
whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that 
no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or 
payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while such Lender was a 
Defaulting Lender; and provided, further, that except to the extent 
otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder 
from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any 
claim of any party hereunder arising from such Lenders having been a 
Defaulting Lender.
 
ARTICLE III
 
TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY
 
Section 3.01                            Taxes.
 
(a)                                 Payments Free of Taxes.  Any and all 
payments made by or on account of any obligation of the Loan Parties 
hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of 
and without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by 
applicable Law, provided that if any applicable withholding agent shall be 
required by applicable Law (as determined in good faith by the applicable 
withholding agent) to deduct or withhold any Taxes from such payments, then 
(i) the applicable withholding agent shall make such deductions or 
withholdings, (ii) the applicable withholding agent shall timely pay the 
full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in 
accordance with applicable Law, and (iii) if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax 
(including any Other Taxes), the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party 
shall be increased as necessary so that after all required deductions or 
withholdings have been made (including deductions applicable to additional 
sums payable under this Section 3.01) the applicable Agent or Lender, as 
the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received 
had no such deductions or withholdings been made.
 
(b)                                 Payment of Other Taxes by the Loan 
Parties.  Without limiting the provisions of subsection (a) above, the Loan 
Parties shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in 
accordance with applicable Law, or at the option of the Administrative 
Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes.
 
(c)                                  Indemnification by the Loan Parties.  
Without duplication of any additional amounts paid under Section 3.01(a), 
the Loan Parties shall indemnify each Agent, and each Lender, within 10 
days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or 
Other Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted 
on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 3.01) payable by 
such Agent, or such Lender, as the case may be, or required to be withheld 
or deducted from a payment to such Agent, or such Lender, as the case may 
be, and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom 
or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other 
Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant 
Governmental Authority.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or 
liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender, or by an Agent on its own 
behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
 
(d)                                 Evidence of Payments.  As soon as 
practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by a Loan 
Party to a Governmental Authority, such Loan Party shall deliver to the 
Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued 
by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the 
return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably 
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
 
(e)                                  Status of Lenders.  Each Lender 
(including an assignee) shall, at such times as are reasonably requested by 
the Borrower or the Administrative Agent and at the time or times 
prescribed by Law, provide the Borrower and the Administrative Agent with 
any documentation prescribed by Law or reasonably requested by the Borrower 
or the Administrative Agent, as will permit the Borrower or the 
Administrative Agent, as the
 
67
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
case may be, (A) to determine whether or not payments made under any Loan 
Document are subject to Taxes, (B) to determine, if applicable, the 
required rate of withholding or deduction, and (C) to establish such 
Lenders entitlement to any available exemption from, or reduction of, 
applicable Taxes in respect of any payments to be made to such Lender 
pursuant to any Loan Document or otherwise to establish such Lenders 
status for withholding tax purposes in an applicable jurisdiction.  Each 
such Lender shall, whenever a lapse in time or change in circumstances 
renders such documentation expired, obsolete or inaccurate in any material 
respect, deliver promptly to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent 
updated or other appropriate documentation (including any new documentation 
reasonably requested by the applicable withholding agent or Borrower) or 
promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its 
legal inability to do so.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the 
preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such 
documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 
3.01(e)(i)(A) and 3.01(e)(i)(B)(1)-(4) and (6)) shall not be required if in 
the Lenders reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission 
would subject such lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or 
would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.
 
    (i)                                     Without limiting the generality
    of the foregoing:
     
        (A)                               Each Lender (including an
        assignee) that is a United States person (as defined in Section
        7701(a)(30) of the Code) shall deliver to the Borrower and the
        Administrative Agent on or before the date on which it becomes a
        party to this Agreement two properly completed and duly signed
        original copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 (or any
        successor form) certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S.
        federal backup withholding.
         
        (B)                               Each Lender (including an
        assignee) that is not a United States person (as defined in Section
        7701(a)(30) of the Code) shall deliver to the Borrower and the
        Administrative Agent on or before the date on which it becomes a
        party to this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter when
        required by Law or upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or
        the Administrative Agent) whichever of the following is applicable:
         
            (1)                                 two duly completed copies
            of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or Form W-8BEN-E, as
            applicable, (or any successor forms) certifying that such
            Lender is not a U.S. Person and, to the extent applicable, is
            eligible for benefits of an income tax treaty to which the
            United States of America is a party,
             
            (2)                                 two duly completed copies
            of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI (or any successor
            forms) claiming that specified payments (as applicable)
            hereunder or any other Loan Documents (as applicable)
            constitute income that is effectively connected with such
            Non-U.S. Lenders conduct or a trade or business in the United
            States,
             
            (3)                                 in the case of a Lender
            (including an assignee) claiming the benefits of the exemption
            for portfolio interest under Sections 881(c) or 871(h) of the
            Code, (x) a certificate, in substantially the form of Exhibit F 
            (any such certificate a United States Tax Compliance
            Certificate), or any other form approved by the Administrative
            Agent, to the effect that such Lender is not a bank within
            the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a 10 percent
            shareholder of the Borrower within the meaning of Section
            881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a controlled foreign corporation
            described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code, and that no
            payments in connection with the Loan Documents are effectively
            connected with such Lenders conduct of a U.S. trade or
            business and (y) two duly completed copies of Internal Revenue
            Service Form W-8BEN or Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable (or any
            successor forms),
 
68
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
            (4)                                 to the extent a Lender is
            not the beneficial owner (for example, where the Lender is a
            partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes), Internal
            Revenue Service Form W-8IMY (or any successor forms) of the
            Lender, accompanied by a Form W-8ECI, W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E,
            United States Tax Compliance Certificate, Form W-9, Form W-8IMY
            (or other successor forms) or any other certification documents
            from each beneficial owner, as applicable (provided that, if
            the Lender is a partnership and one or more beneficial owners
            are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, the United
            States Tax Compliance Certificate may be provided by such
            Lender on behalf of such beneficial owner(s)),
             
            (5)                                 any other form prescribed
            by applicable requirements of U.S. federal income tax Law as a
            basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S.
            federal withholding Tax duly completed together with such
            supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable
            requirements of Law to permit the Borrower and the
            Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction
            required to be made, or
             
            (6)                                 if a payment made to a
            Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal
            withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to
            comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA
            (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the
            Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower
            and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by
            law and at such times or times reasonably requested by the
            Borrower or Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed
            (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the
            Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by
            the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary
            for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with
            their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender
            has complied with such Lenders obligations under FATCA or to
            determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.
            Solely for purposes of the clause (6), FATCA shall include
            any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
             
    (ii)                                  Each Lender shall, from time to
    time after the initial delivery by such Lender of the forms described
    above, whenever a lapse in time or change in such Lenders
    circumstances renders such forms, certificates or other evidence so
    delivered expired, obsolete or inaccurate, promptly (1) deliver to the
    Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as
    shall be requested by the recipient) renewals, amendments or additional
    or successor forms, properly completed and duly executed by such
    Lender, together with any other certificate or statement of exemption
    required in order to confirm or establish such Lenders status or that
    such Lender is entitled to an exemption from or reduction in U.S.
    federal withholding Tax or (2) notify Administrative Agent and the
    Borrower in writing of its legal inability to deliver any such forms,
    certificates or other evidence.
     
    (iii)                               Notwithstanding any other provision
    of this clause (e), a Lender shall not be required to deliver any form
    that such Lender is not legally eligible to deliver.
     
(f)                                   Treatment of Certain Refunds.  If any 
party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it 
has received a refund of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes as to which 
it has been indemnified by a Loan Party or with respect to which a Loan 
Party has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section, it shall pay to 
the Loan Party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of 
indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Loan Party 
under this Section with respect to the Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes 
giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of such 
Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, and without interest (other than 
any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to 
such refund and net of any Taxes payable by any Agent or Lender
 
69
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
thereon), provided that the applicable Loan Party, upon the request of such 
Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the 
applicable Loan Party (plus any penalties, interest or other charges 
imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to such Agent or such 
Lender in the event such Agent or such Lender is required to repay such 
refund to such Governmental Authority.  Notwithstanding anything to the 
contrary in this paragraph (f), in no event will any Agent or any Lender be 
required to pay any amount to any Loan Party pursuant to this paragraph (f) 
the payment of which would put such Agent or such Lender in a less 
favorable net after-Tax position than such Agent or such Lender would have 
been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such 
refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the 
indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had 
never been paid.  This subsection shall not be construed to require any 
Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other 
information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to the 
Borrower or any other Person.
 
(g)                                  Each partys obligations under this 
Section 3.01 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the 
Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, 
a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and repayment, satisfaction or 
discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document.
 
Section 3.02                            Illegality.  If, on or after the 
Closing Date (or with respect to any Lender, if later, the date on which 
such Lender became a Lender), the adoption of any applicable Law, or any 
change in any applicable Law, or any change in the interpretation or 
administration thereof by any Governmental Authority, central bank or 
comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration 
thereof, or compliance by any Lender (or its Lending Office) with any 
request or directive (whether or not having the force of Law) of any such 
authority, central bank or comparable agency shall make it unlawful or 
impossible for any Lender (or its Lending Office) to make, maintain or fund 
any of its Eurodollar Loans and such Lender shall so notify the 
Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent shall forthwith give notice 
thereof to the other Lenders and the Borrower, whereupon, until such Lender 
notifies the Borrower and the Administrative Agent that the circumstances 
giving rise to such suspension no longer exist, the obligation of such 
Lender to make Eurodollar Loans, or to convert outstanding Loans into 
Eurodollar Loans, shall be suspended.  If such notice is given, each 
Eurodollar Loan of such Lender then outstanding shall be converted to a 
Base Rate Loan either (i) on the last day of the then current Interest 
Period applicable to such Eurodollar Loan, if such Lender may lawfully 
continue to maintain and fund such Loan to such day or (ii) immediately, if 
such Lender shall determine that it may not lawfully continue to maintain 
and fund such Loan to such day.
 
Section 3.03                            Inability To Determine Rates.  If 
on or prior to the first day of any Interest Period for any Eurodollar 
Loan:
 
    (i)                                     the Administrative Agent
    determines (which determination shall be conclusive) that by reason of
    circumstances affecting the relevant market, adequate and reasonable
    means do not exist for ascertaining the applicable Eurodollar Rate for
    such Interest Period; or
     
    (ii)                                  Lenders having 50% or more of the
    aggregate amount of the Commitments advise the Administrative Agent
    that the Eurodollar Rate as determined by the Administrative Agent will
    not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding
    their Eurodollar Loans for such Interest Period;
     
the Administrative Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the 
Borrower and the Lenders, whereupon, until the Administrative Agent 
notifies the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension 
no longer exist, (i) the obligations of the Lenders to make Eurodollar 
Loans, or to continue or convert outstanding Loans as or into Eurodollar 
Loans, shall be suspended and (ii) each outstanding Eurodollar Loan shall 
be converted into a Base Rate Loan on the last day of the then current 
Interest Period applicable thereto.  Unless the Borrower notifies the 
Administrative Agent prior to 12:00 PM on the Business Day of the date of 
any Eurodollar Borrowing for which a Notice of Borrowing has previously 
been given that it elects not to borrow on such date, such Borrowing shall 
instead be made as an Adjusted Base Rate Borrowing in the same aggregate 
amount as the requested Borrowing and shall bear interest for each day from 
and including the first
 
70
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
day to but excluding the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto 
at the rate applicable to Revolving Base Rate Loans for such day.
 
Section 3.04                            Increased Costs and Reduced Return; 
Capital Adequacy.
 
(a)                                 Increased Costs Generally.  Except with 
respect to Excluded Taxes, if any Change in Law shall:
 
    (i)                                     impose, modify or deem
    applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance
    charge or similar requirement against assets held by, deposits with or
    for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any
    Lender (or its Lending Office) (except any reserve requirement which is
    reflected in the determination of the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate
    hereunder);
     
    (ii)                                  subject the Administrative Agent,
    any Lender (or its Lending Office) to any Tax of any kind whatsoever
    with respect to this Agreement or any Loan made by it, or change the
    basis of taxation of payments to the Administrative Agent or such
    Lender in respect thereof (except for Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes
    indemnified under Section 3.01(c) and the imposition of, or any change
    in the rate of, any Excluded Tax described in clauses (ii)-(iv) of the
    definition of Excluded Taxes payable by such Lender or Connection
    Income Taxes); or
     
    (iii)                               impose on any Lender (or its
    Lending Office) or the London interbank market any other condition,
    cost or expense (other than Taxes) affecting this Agreement or
    Eurodollar Loans made by such Lender;
     
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to the 
Administrative Agent or such Lender (or its Lending Office) of making, 
converting to, continuing on or maintaining any Loan (or of maintaining its 
obligation to make any such Loan), or to reduce the amount of any sum 
received or receivable by the Administrative Agent or such Lender hereunder 
(whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of 
the Administrative Agent or such Lender, the Borrower will pay to the 
Administrative Agent or such Lender such additional amount or amounts as 
will compensate the Administrative Agent or such Lender for such additional 
costs incurred or reduction suffered.
 
(b)                                 Capital Requirements.  Except with 
respect to any Excluded Tax described in clauses (ii)-(iv) of the 
definition of Excluded Taxes or Connection Income Taxes, if any Lender 
determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or any Lending 
Office of such Lender or such Lenders holding company, if any, regarding 
capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing 
the rate of return on such Lenders capital or on the capital of such 
Lenders holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the 
Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by such Lender to a level 
below that which such Lender or such Lenders holding company could have 
achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such 
Lenders policies and the policies of such Lenders holding company with 
respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay 
to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such 
Lender or such Lenders holding company for any such reduction suffered.
 
(c)                                  Certificates for Reimbursement.  A 
certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount necessary to compensate 
such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in 
subsection (a) or (b) of this Section and delivered to the Borrower shall 
be conclusive absent manifest error.  The Borrower shall pay such Lender 
the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after 
receipt thereof.
 
(d)                                 Delays in Requests.  Failure or delay 
on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing 
provisions of this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lenders 
right to demand such compensation, provided that the Borrower shall not be 
required to compensate a Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of 
this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more 
than 180 days prior to the date on which Borrower receives a certificate 
from such Lender notifying the Borrower
 
71
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions as 
provided in subsection (c) (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise 
to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 180-day 
period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of 
retroactive effect thereof).
 
Section 3.05                            Compensation for Losses.  Within 
thirty (30) days following demand of any Lender (with a copy to the 
Administrative Agent) from time to time, the Borrower shall promptly 
compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, 
cost or out-of-pocket expense incurred by it as a result of:
 
    (i)                                     any continuation, conversion,
    payment or prepayment of any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on a day
    other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether
    voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or
    otherwise);
     
    (ii)                                  any failure by the Borrower (for
    a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to
    prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Loan other than a Base Rate
    Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrower; or
     
    (iii)                               any assignment of a Eurodollar Rate
    Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor
    as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 10.13;
     
excluding any loss of anticipated profits from maintaining such broken 
contract and excluding any differential on an applicable margin on funds so 
redeployed but including any loss or expense arising from the liquidation 
or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees 
payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained.  The 
Borrower shall also pay any customary administrative fees charged by such 
Lender in connection with the foregoing.  A certificate (with reasonable 
supporting detail) of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts which 
such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 3.05 shall be 
delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error; 
provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate such Lender 
pursuant to this Section 3.05 for any loss, cost or expense incurred more 
than 30 days prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower in 
writing of the loss, cost or expense and of such Lenders intention to 
claim compensation thereof; provided, further, that, if a Change in Law 
giving rise to such loss, cost or expense is retroactive, then the 30-day 
period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of 
retroactive effect thereof.
 
For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders 
under this Section 3.05, each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each 
Eurodollar Rate Loan made by it at the Eurodollar Rate for such Loan by a 
matching deposit or other borrowing in the London interbank eurodollar 
market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not 
such Eurodollar Rate Loan was in fact so funded.
 
Section 3.06                            Base Rate Loans Substituted for 
Affected Eurodollar Loans.  If (i) the obligation of any Lender to make, or 
to continue or convert outstanding Loans as or to, Eurodollar Loans has 
been suspended pursuant to Section 3.02 or (ii) any Lender has demanded 
compensation under Section 3.04 with respect to its Eurodollar Loans, and 
in any such case the Borrower shall, by at least five Business Days prior 
notice to such Lender through the Administrative Agent, have elected that 
the provisions of this Section 3.06 shall apply to such Lender, then, 
unless and until such Lender notifies the Borrower that the circumstances 
giving rise to such suspension or demand for compensation no longer exist, 
all Loans which would otherwise be made by such Lender as (or continued as 
or converted to) Eurodollar Loans shall instead be Base Rate Loans (on 
which interest and principal shall be payable contemporaneously with the 
related Eurodollar Loans of the other Lenders).  If such Lender notifies 
the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension or 
demand for compensation no longer exist, the principal amount of each such 
Base Rate Loan shall be converted into a Eurodollar Loan on the first day 
of the next succeeding Interest Period applicable to the related Eurodollar 
Loans of the other Lenders.

Section 3.07                            Mitigation Obligations; Replacement 
of Lenders.
 
(a)                                 Designation of a Different Lending 
Office.  If any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.04, or the 
Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any 
Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 
3.01, or if any Lender gives a notice pursuant to Section 3.02, then such 
Lender shall (at the request of the Borrower) use reasonable efforts to 
designate a different Lending Office for funding or booking its Loans 
hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of 
its offices, branches or Affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, 
such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts 
payable pursuant to Section 3.01 or 3.04, as the case may be, in the future 
and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense 
and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender.  The Borrower 
hereby agrees to pay all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and 
expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or 
assignment.
 
(b)                                 Replacement of Lenders.  If any Lender 
requests compensation under Section 3.04 or gives a notice under Section 
3.02, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any 
Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant 
to Section 3.01, the Borrower may replace such Lender in accordance with 
Section 10.13.
 
Section 3.08                            Survival.  All of the Borrowers 
obligations under this Article III shall survive termination of the 
Commitments and repayment of all other Senior Credit Obligations hereunder 
to the extent set forth in this Article III.

Statements.  (i) The Borrower Audited Financial Statements (x) were 
prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied throughout the 
respective periods covered thereby, except as otherwise expressly noted 
therein and (y) fairly present in all material respects the financial 
condition of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries as of the respective dates 
thereof and their results of operations for the respective periods covered 
thereby in accordance with GAAP consistently applied throughout the 
respective periods covered thereby, except as otherwise expressly noted 
therein.
 
    (ii)                                  The Target Audited Financial
    Statements (x) were prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently
    applied throughout the respective periods covered thereby, except as
    otherwise expressly noted therein and (y) fairly present in all
    material respects the financial condition of Target and its
    Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and their results of operations
    for the respective periods covered thereby in accordance with GAAP
    consistently applied throughout the respective periods covered thereby,
    except as otherwise expressly noted therein.
     
    (iii)                               The Borrower Quarterly Financial

    and absence of footnotes and (y) fairly present in all material
    respects the financial condition of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries
    as of the date and for the period to which they relate.
     
    (iv)                              The Target Quarterly Financial
    Statements (x) were prepared in accordance with GAAP, except as
    otherwise expressly noted therein and for year-end audit adjustments
    and absence of footnotes and (y) fairly present in all material
    respects the financial condition of the Target and its Subsidiaries as
    of the date and for the period to which they relate.
     
(b)                                 [Reserved].
 
(c)                                  Material Adverse Change.  Since 
December 31, 2013, there has been no event or circumstance, either 
individually or in the aggregate, that has had or would reasonably be 
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
 
(d)                                 Pro Forma Financial Statements.  The 
Pro Forma Financial Statements have been prepared in good faith by the 
Borrower, based on the assumptions which are believed by the Borrower on 
the date they were made to be reasonable, are based on information 
available to the Borrower as of the date of delivery thereof, and present 
fairly in all material respects on a Pro Forma Basis the estimated 
consolidated financial position of the Borrower and its Consolidated 
Subsidiaries as of September 30, 2014 assuming that the Transactions had 
actually occurred on that date.
 
(e)                                  Projections.  As of the Closing Date, 
the projections (which include projected balance sheets and income and cash 
flow statements) set forth in all material respects the projected financial 
position of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries on an annual basis for the 
period from January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2020.  The projections 
have been prepared in good faith, and, other than purchase accounting as it 
relates to the balance sheet, on a basis consistent with the financial 
statements referred to in subsection (a) above and based upon assumptions 
believed to be reasonable at the time made, it being recognized by the 
Lenders, however, that projections as to future events are not to be viewed 
as facts and that actual results during the period or periods covered by 
such projections may differ from the projected results and that such 
differences may be material.
 
Section 5.06                            Litigation.  There are no actions, 
suits, investigations or legal, equitable, arbitration or administrative 
proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of any Loan Party, threatened in 
writing against any Group Company that would reasonably be expected to 
result in a Material Adverse Effect.

(a)                                 Generally.  Each Group Company has good 
title to, valid leasehold interests in, or license in, all its property 
material to its business, free and clear of all Liens, except for Permitted 
Liens and minor irregularities or deficiencies in title that, individually 
or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to result in a 
Material Adverse Effect.  The property of the Group Companies, taken as a 
whole, (a) is in good operating order, condition and repair (ordinary wear 
and tear and damage by casualty excepted) and (b) constitutes all the 
property which is required for the business and operations of the Group 
Companies as presently conducted, in each case, to the extent that it would 
not be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.
 
(b)                                 Flood Insurance.  No Mortgage encumbers 
improved Real Property that is located in an area that has been identified 
by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development as an area having special 
flood hazards within the meaning of the National Flood Insurance Act of 
1968 unless flood insurance available under such Act has been obtained in 
accordance with Section 6.07.
 
Section 5.08                            Environmental Matters.
 
(a)                                 Except as individually or in the 
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse 
Effect:
 
    (i)                                     Each Group Company and their
    businesses, operations and property are in compliance with, and they
    have no liability under, Environmental Law;
     
    (ii)                                  Each Group Company has obtained,
    or has applied in a timely manner for, all Environmental Permits
    required for the conduct of their businesses and operations, and the
    ownership, operation and use of their property, under Environmental
    Law, and all such Environmental Permits are valid and in good standing;
     
    (iii)                               There has been no Release or
    threatened Release of Hazardous Material on, at, under or from any Real
    Property or facility presently or, to the knowledge of any Loan Party,
    formerly owned, leased or operated by any Group Company or their
    predecessors in interest that would reasonably be expected to result in
    liability of any Group Company under, or noncompliance by any Group
    Company with, any Environmental Law;
     
    (iv)                              There is no claim, demand, notice of
    violation, notice of potential responsibility, action, suit,

    with, or liability under, any Environmental Law pending or, to the
    knowledge of any Group Company, threatened against any Group Company,
    or relating to any Real Property or facilities currently or, to the
    knowledge of any Loan Party, formerly owned, leased or operated by any
    Group Company or relating to the operations of any Group Company, and
    there are no actions, activities, circumstances, conditions, or
    occurrences that would reasonably be expected to form the basis of such
    matter;
     
    (v)                                 No Person with an indemnity or
    contribution obligation to any Group Company relating to compliance
    with, or liability under, Environmental Law is in default with respect
    to such obligation;
     
    (vi)                              No Group Company is obligated to
    perform any action or otherwise incur any expense under Environmental
    Law pursuant to any order, decree, judgment or agreement by which it is
    bound or has assumed by contract or agreement, and none of them is
    conducting or financing, in whole or in part, any investigation,
    response or other corrective action pursuant to any Environmental Law
    at any location;
 
79
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
    (vii)                           No Lien has been recorded or, to the
    knowledge of any Loan Party, threatened under any Environmental Law
    with respect to any Real Property or other assets of any Group Company;
    and
     
    (viii)                        No Real Property or facility owned,
    operated or leased by the Group Companies and, to the knowledge of the
    Loan Parties, no Real Property or facility formerly owned, operated or
    leased by the Group Companies or any of their predecessors in interest
    is (i) listed or proposed for listing on the National Priorities List
    promulgated pursuant to CERCLA or (ii) listed on the Comprehensive
    Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Information System
    promulgated pursuant to CERCLA or (iii) included on any similar list
    maintained by any Governmental Authority including any such list
    relating to petroleum.
     
Section 5.09                            Insurance.  Schedule 5.09 sets 
forth a true, complete and correct description in all material respects of 
all insurance maintained by each Loan Party on the Closing Date.  The 
properties of each Group Company are insured with financially sound and 
reputable insurance companies not Affiliates of the Borrower, in such 
amounts (after giving effect to any self-insurance compatible with the 
following standards), with such deductibles and covering such risks as are 
prudent in the reasonable business judgment of the Borrowers officers.
 
Section 5.10                            Taxes.
 
(a)                                 Each Group Company has filed, or caused 
to be filed, all federal and state, provincial, local and foreign Tax 
returns required to be filed and paid (i) all amounts of Taxes shown 
thereon to be due and (ii) all material other Taxes (including mortgage 
recording taxes, documentary stamp taxes and intangible taxes) owing by it 
(including in their capacity as a withholding agent), except for Taxes 
being contested in good faith through appropriate proceedings diligently 
conducted and as to which adequate reserves have been established in 
accordance with GAAP, or for such failures to file or pay as would not 
reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to result in a 
Material Adverse Effect.  No Group Company knows of any pending 
investigation, Tax audit or deficiencies of any Group Company by any taxing 
authority or proposed tax assessments against any Group Company that would, 
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a 
Material Adverse Effect.
 
(b)                                 No Group Company has ever 
participated in a listed transaction within the meaning of Treasury 
Regulation Section 1.6011-4.
 
Section 5.11                            ERISA; Employee Benefit 
Arrangements.  Except as disclosed in Schedule 5.11:
 
(a)                                 ERISA.
 
    (i)                                     None of the Group Companies
    have or could have any current or contingent liability with respect to
    any Plan.
     
    (ii)                                  Each Employee Benefit Arrangement
    complies in all respects with the applicable requirements of ERISA, the
    Code, and its terms, except to the extent that the failure to comply
    therewith would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
    Effect.
     
    (iii)                               Except as would not reasonably be
    expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, no ERISA Event has occurred
    or, subject to the passage of time, is reasonably expected to occur.
     
    (iv)                              No Group Company has any liability
    with respect to any post-retirement benefit under a Welfare Plan that
    would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
 
(b)                                 Employee Benefit Arrangements.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
    (i)                                     All liabilities under the
    Employee Benefit Arrangements are (A) funded to at least the minimum
    level required by Law or, if higher, to the level required by the terms
    governing the Employee Benefit Arrangements, (B) insured with a
    reputable insurance company, (C) provided for or recognized in the
    financial statements most recently delivered to the Administrative
    Agent pursuant to Section 6.01 hereof or (D) estimated in the formal
    notes to the financial statements most recently delivered to the
    Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 6.01 hereof, where such
    failure to fund, insure, provide for, recognize or estimate the
    liabilities arising under such arrangements would reasonably be
    expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
     
    (ii)                                  There are no circumstances which
    may give rise to a liability in relation to the Employee Benefit
    Arrangements which are not funded, insured, provided for, recognized or
    estimated in the manner described in clause (i) above and which would
    reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
     
    (iii)                               Each Group Company is in compliance
    with all applicable Laws, trust documentation and contracts relating to
    the Employee Benefit Arrangements, except as would not be expected to
    have a Material Adverse Effect.
     
Section 5.12                            Subsidiaries; Equity Interests.  
Schedule 5.12 sets forth a complete and accurate list as of the Closing 
Date of all Subsidiaries of the Borrower.  Schedule 5.12 sets forth as of 
the Closing Date the jurisdiction of formation of each such Subsidiary, 
whether each such Subsidiary is a Subsidiary Guarantor, the number of 
authorized shares of each class of Equity Interests of each such 
Subsidiary, the number of outstanding shares of each class of Equity 
Interests, the number and percentage of outstanding shares of each class of 
Equity Interests of each such Subsidiary owned (directly or indirectly) by 
any Person and the number and effect, if exercised, of all Equity 
Equivalents with respect to Equity Interests of each such Subsidiary.  All 
the outstanding Equity Interests of each Subsidiary of the Borrower are 
validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable (to the extent applicable) 
and were not issued in violation of the preemptive rights of any 
shareholder and, as of the Closing Date, those owned by the Borrower, 
directly or indirectly, are free and clear of all Liens (other than those 
arising under the Collateral Documents).  Other than as set forth on 
Schedule 5.12, as of the Closing Date, no such Subsidiary has outstanding 
any Equity Equivalents nor does any such Person have outstanding any rights 
to subscribe for or to purchase or any options for the purchase of, or any 
agreements providing for the issuance (contingent or otherwise) of, or any 
calls, commitments or claims of any character relating to, its Equity 
Interests.
 
Section 5.13                            Margin Regulations; Investment 
Company Act.
 
(a)                                 No Group Company is engaged 
principally, or as one of its important activities, in the business of 
extending credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying Margin Stock.  
No part of the proceeds of any Borrowing will be used, whether directly or 
indirectly, and whether immediately, incidentally or ultimately, for any 
purpose that entails a violation of, or that is inconsistent with 
Regulation T, U or X.  The pledge of the Securities Collateral (as defined 
in the Security Agreement) pursuant to the Security Agreement does not 
cause any Borrowing to be directly or indirectly secured by Margin Stock 
for purposes of Regulation U.
 
(b)                                 None of the Group Companies is subject 
to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.  None 
of the Group Companies is (i) an investment company registered or 
required to be registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as 
amended, or (ii) controlled by any such company.
 
Section 5.14                            Disclosure.  The written reports, 
financial statements, certificates and other written information (other 
than projections, budgets, forecasts, estimates and other forward looking 
information or information of a general economic or industry specific 
nature) furnished with respect to any Group Company by or on behalf of any 
Loan Party or by their respective representatives to the Administrative 
Agent or any Lender in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby 
or delivered hereunder or under any other
 
81
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Loan Document (in each case, as modified or supplemented by other 
information so furnished), when taken as a whole, do not contain any untrue 
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary 
to make the statements therein not materially misleading, in each case in 
light of the circumstances under which they were made; provided that, with 
respect to projected financial information and other forward-looking 
statements, the Borrower represents only that such information was prepared 
in good faith based upon assumptions believed by the Borrower to be 
reasonable at the time made (it being understood and agreed that 
projections as to future events are not to be viewed as facts or guaranties 
of future performance and are subject to uncertainties or contingencies, 
many of which are beyond the control of the Group Companies, that the 
Borrower makes no representation that such projections will be realized, 
and that actual results during the period or periods covered by such 
projections may differ from the projected results and that such differences 
may be material).
 
Section 5.15                            Compliance with Law.
 
(a)                                 Each Group Company is in compliance 
with all requirements of Law (including Health Care Laws and Environmental 
Laws) applicable to it or to its properties, except for any such failure to 
comply which would not reasonably be expected to cause a Material Adverse 
Effect.  Except as would not reasonably be expected to cause a Material 
Adverse Effect, no Group Company has engaged in activities which are, as 
applicable, cause for false claims liability, civil penalties, or mandatory 
or permissive exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid, or any other state health 
care program or federal health care program (collectively, the Programs
).  To the knowledge of the Loan Parties, none of the Group Companies or 
any of their respective material properties or assets is subject to or in 
default with respect to any judgment, writ, injunction, decree or order of 
any court or other Governmental Authority which, individually or in the 
aggregate, would reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse 
Effect.  As of the Closing Date, except as disclosed in part (a) of 
Schedule 5.15, none of the Group Companies has received any communication 
from any Governmental Authority that alleges that any of the Group 
Companies is not in compliance in any material respect with any Law, except 
for any statements of deficiencies from a Governmental Authority in 
connection with surveys and other reviews in the Ordinary Course of 
Business, or allegations that have been satisfactorily resolved and are no 
longer outstanding or which, individually or in the aggregate, would not 
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.
 
(b)                                 Each Group Company that holds and 
maintains health care facilities or provides health care services has 
procured and maintains all required licenses, permits, registrations, 
accreditations, provider numbers, certificates, consents, orders, approvals 
and other authorizations from all federal, state, local and other 
Governmental Authorities, presently required or necessary to own or lease, 
as the case may be, and to operate each Group Companys respective 
properties and to carry on each Group Companys respective businesses (the 
Permits) for all of its (if any) health care facilities, except where a 
failure to procure or maintain such Permit would not reasonably be expected 
to result in a Material Adverse Effect.  Each Permit is valid and in full 
force and effect.  There are no Actions pending or, to the knowledge of the 
Loan Parties, threatened in writing before any Governmental Authority that 
seek the revocation, cancellation, suspension or adverse modification of 
any such Permits, except Actions that would not, individually or in the 
aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.  
None of the Permits is subject to any order, unsatisfied judgment, 
suspension, writ, injunction, probation or decree, and each Group Company 
is in compliance in all material respects with the terms of the Permits, in 
each case except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably 
be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.
 
(c)                                  Each Group Company, as applicable, 
meets all material requirements of participation, claims submission and 
payment of the Programs and other third party payment programs and are a 
party to valid participation agreements for payment by such Programs and 
other third party payment programs, except for any failure which would not 
reasonably be expected to cause a Material Adverse Effect.  No Group 
Company and none of any of the Group Companies current officers, directors 
or employees is currently debarred, suspended or excluded from 
participation in any such Program.
 
82
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
(d)                                 Except, on the Closing Date, as set 
forth on part (d) of Schedule 5.15: (i) there are no material Program 
recoupments or material recoupments of any third-party payor being sought, 
requested or claimed, or to the Loan Parties knowledge, threatened against 
any Group Company, except as has not had, and would not reasonably be 
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse 
Effect; (ii) none of the Group Companies has received written notice of any 
Action pending or, to the Group Companys knowledge, threatened, against 
any Group Company which relates in any way to a violation of any legal 
requirement pertaining to the Programs or which could result in the 
imposition of material penalties, except as has not had, and would not 
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a 
Material Adverse Effect, or the exclusion of any Group Company from 
participation in any Programs; and (iii) no Group Company is a party to any 
corporate integrity agreements, deferred prosecution agreements, monitoring 
agreements, consent decrees, settlement orders, or similar agreements 
imposed by any Governmental Authority, except for instances that, 
individually and in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be 
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
 
(e)                                  Except as has not had, and would not 
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a 
Material Adverse Effect, to the Loan Parties knowledge, all reports, data, 
and information required to be filed by each Group Company, in connection 
with any Program have been timely filed and were true and complete at the 
time filed (or were corrected in or supplemented by a subsequent filing). 
There are no claims, actions or appeals pending (and to the Borrowers 
knowledge, no Group Company has made any filing or submission that would 
result in any claims, actions or appeals) before any court, regulatory 
body, administrative agency, governmental body, arbitrator or other 
authority (including governmental fiscal agents) with respect to any 
Program reports or claims filed by any Group Company on or before the date 
hereof, or with respect to any disallowances by any regulatory body, 
administrative agency, governmental body or other authority (including 
governmental fiscal agents) in connection with any audit or any claims 
that, if adversely determined, which have had and would reasonably be 
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse 
Effect.  No validation review or program integrity review related to any 
Group Company has been conducted by any regulatory body, administrative 
agency, governmental body or other authority (including governmental fiscal 
agents) in connection with any Program within the past three (3) years 
which, if determined adversely to any such Group Company, has had, or would 
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a 
Material Adverse Effect, and to the Loan Parties knowledge, no such 
reviews are scheduled, pending, threatened against or affecting any Group 
Company.
 
Section 5.16                            Intellectual Property.  Except as 
set forth on Schedule 5.16, (a) each Group Company owns, or possesses the 
right to use, all of the trademarks, service marks, trade names, 
copyrights, patents, patent rights, franchises, licenses and other 
intellectual property rights (Intellectual Property) that are reasonably 
necessary for the operation of its respective business, except as would not 
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, and (b) no Group 
Company is infringing, misappropriating, diluting, or otherwise violating 
the Intellectual Property of any other Person, except as would not 
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
 
Section 5.17                            Use of Proceeds.  The proceeds of 
(a) the Term Loans borrowed on the Closing Date will be used to finance, in 
part, the Acquisition, the Refinancing and to pay fees and expenses in 
connection with the Transactions and (b) any Incremental Loans will be used 
by the Borrower for general corporate purposes and other legal purposes of 
the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (including, without limitation, Permitted 
Acquisitions, Permitted Intellectual Property Asset Acquisitions and other 
permitted Investments, refinancing of Indebtedness, Consolidated Capital 
Expenditures and permitted Restricted Payments).
 
Section 5.18                            Solvency.  As of the Closing Date, 
the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (on a consolidated basis) are and, 
immediately following the consummation of the Transactions and the 
financings related thereto, will be, Solvent.
 
Section 5.19                            Collateral Documents.
 
83
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
(a)                                 Article 9 Collateral.  Each of the 
Security Agreement and the Pledge Agreement, when executed and delivered, 
is effective to create in favor of the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of 
the Finance Parties, a legal, valid and enforceable security interest in 
the Collateral described therein and, when financing statements in 
appropriate form are filed in the offices specified on Schedule 4.01 to the 
Security Agreement and the Pledged Collateral is delivered to the 
Collateral Agent, each of the Security Agreement and the Pledge Agreement 
shall constitute a fully perfected Lien on, and security interest in, all 
right, title and interest of the grantors thereunder in such of the 
Collateral in which a security interest can be perfected under Article 9 of 
the UCC by filing or by possession or control thereof, in each case prior 
and superior in right to any other Person, other than with respect to 
Permitted Liens, and except for certain items of Collateral with respect to 
which such Lien may be perfected only by possession or control thereof and 
the failure of the Collateral Agent to have possession or control thereof 
is expressly permitted pursuant to the Security Agreement and/or Pledge 
Agreement, as applicable.
 
(b)                                 Intellectual Property.  When financing 
statements in the appropriate form are filed in the offices specified on 
Schedule 4.01 to the Security Agreement, the Grant of Security Interest in 
Patents and Trademarks, substantially in the form of Exhibit A to the 
Security Agreement, is filed in the United States Patent and Trademark 
Office and the Grant of Security Interest in Copyrights, substantially in 
the form of Exhibit B to the Security Agreement, is filed in the United 
States Copyright Office, then the Security Agreement shall constitute a 
fully perfected Lien on, and security interest in, all right, title and 
interest of the grantors thereunder in the United States patents, 
trademarks, copyrights, licenses and other intellectual property rights 
covered in such agreements, in each case prior and superior in right to any 
other Person (it being understood that subsequent recordings in the United 
States Patent and Trademark Office and the United States Copyright Office 
may be necessary to perfect a lien on issued patents, patent applications, 
registered trademarks, trademark applications and copyrights acquired by 
the Loan Parties after the Closing Date).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, 
nothing in this Agreement shall require any Group Company to make any 
filing or take any action to record or perfect a Lien on, or security 
interest in, any intellectual property outside the United States.
 
(c)                                  Status of Liens.  The Collateral 
Agent, for the benefit of the Finance Parties, will at all times have the 
Liens provided for in the Collateral Documents and, subject to the filing 
by the Collateral Agent of continuation statements to the extent required 
by the UCC and maintaining control or possession of Collateral to the 
extent required by the Collateral Documents and to the qualifications and 
limitations set forth in clauses (a) and (b) above, the Collateral 
Documents will at all times constitute valid and continuing liens of record 
and first priority perfected security interests in all the Collateral 
referred to therein, except as priority may be affected by Permitted Liens.
 
(d)                                 Mortgages.  Each Mortgage, when 
executed and delivered, is effective to create, in favor of the Collateral 
Agent, for its benefit and the benefit of the Finance Parties, legal, valid 
and enforceable first priority Liens on, and security interests in, all of 
the Loan Parties right, title and interest in and to the Mortgaged 
Properties thereunder and the proceeds thereof, subject only to Permitted 
Liens, and when the Mortgages are filed in the offices specified in the 
local counsel opinion delivered with respect thereto in accordance with the 
provisions of Section 6.12), the Mortgages shall constitute fully perfected 
Liens on, and security interests in, all right, title and interest of the 
Loan Parties in the Mortgaged Properties and the proceeds thereof, in each 
case prior and superior in right to any other Person, other than Liens 
permitted by such Mortgage.

established in accordance with GAAP or (B) to the extent failure to file

times maintain in full force and effect insurance (including workers

liabilities and with such deductibles or self-insurance retentions as are 
prudent in the good faith judgment of the officers of the Borrower.  The 
Collateral Agent shall be named as loss payee or mortgagee, as its interest 
may appear, with respect to all such property and casualty policies and 
additional insured with respect to all business interruption or liability 
policies (other than workers compensation, director and officer liability

provider of any such insurance shall agree, by endorsement upon the policy 
or policies issued by it or by independent instruments furnished to the 
Collateral Agent, that it will use commercially reasonable efforts to give 
the Collateral Agent 30 days prior written notice before any such policy

will comply with all requirements of Law (including Health Care Laws and 
Environmental Laws) applicable to it and its properties to the extent that 
noncompliance with any such requirement of Law would reasonably be expected 
to have a Material Adverse Effect.  Without limiting the generality of the 
foregoing, each of the Group Companies will do each of the following as it 
relates to any Plan maintained by, or Multiemployer Plan contributed to by, 
each of the Group Companies or Employee Benefit Arrangement except to the 
extent that any failure to do any of the following would not reasonably be 
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect:  (i) maintain each Plan (other 
than a Multiemployer Plan) and Employee Benefit Arrangement in compliance

reputable insurance company; or (C) provided for or recognized in the 
financial statements most recently delivered to the Administrative Agent 
under Section 6.01(a) or (b); (viii) ensure that the material contributions 
or premium payments to or in respect of all Employee Benefit Arrangements 
are and continue to be promptly paid at no less than the rates required 
under the rules of such arrangements and in accordance with the most recent 
actuarial advice received in relation to the Employee Benefit Arrangement 
and generally in accordance with applicable Law; and (ix) use its 
reasonable efforts to cause each of its ERISA Affiliates to do each of the 
items listed in clauses (i) through (vii) above as it relates to Plans and 
Multiemployer Plans maintained by or contributed to by its ERISA Affiliates 
such that there shall be no liability to a Group Company by virtue of such 
ERISA Affiliates acts or failure to act.

Administrative Agent to visit and inspect any of its properties, to examine 
its corporate, financial and operating records, and make copies thereof or 
abstracts therefrom, and to discuss its affairs, finances and accounts with 
its officers and employees, all at such reasonable times during normal 
business hours, upon reasonable advance notice to the Borrower; provided, 
however, that (1) when an Event of Default exists the Administrative Agent 
(or any of its representatives or independent contractors) may do any of 
the foregoing at the expense of the Borrower at any time during normal 
business hours and (2) representatives of any Lender may accompany the 
Administrative Agent, at such Lenders expense.
 
Section 6.11         Use of Proceeds.  The Borrower will use the proceeds 
of the Loans solely for the purposes set forth in Section 5.17.
 
Section 6.12         Additional Loan Parties; Additional Security.
 
(a)           Additional Subsidiary Guarantors.  The Borrower will take, 
and will cause each of Borrowers Subsidiaries (other than Excluded 
Subsidiaries) to take, such actions from time to time as shall be necessary 
to ensure that all Subsidiaries of Borrower (other than Excluded 
Subsidiaries) are Subsidiary Guarantors not later than the time set forth

Company shall form or acquire any new Subsidiary (other than an Excluded 
Subsidiary), the Borrower, as soon as practicable and in any event within 
30 days (or such later date as may be agreed by the Administrative Agent in 
its sole discretion) after such formation or acquisition, will provide the 
Collateral Agent with notice of such formation or acquisition and the 
Borrower will cause such new Subsidiary to:
 
    (i)            within 30 days (or such later date as may be agreed by
    the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion) after such formation
    or acquisition, (A) execute an Accession Agreement pursuant to which
    such new Subsidiary shall agree to become a Subsidiary Guarantor
    under the Guaranty; a Subsidiary Guarantor under the Security

    and/or an obligor under such other Collateral Documents as may be

------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
    new Subsidiary and (B) take all actions required to be taken by such
    Collateral Documents to perfect the liens granted thereunder; and
     
    (ii)           deliver such proof of organizational authority,
    incumbency of officers, opinions of counsel and other documents as is
    consistent with those delivered by each Loan Party pursuant to Section
    4.01 of this Agreement on the Closing Date or as the Administrative
    Agent or the Collateral Agent shall have reasonably requested in order
    to evidence compliance with this Section 6.12.
 
(b)           Additional Security.  (i)  The Borrower will, and will cause 
each of its Subsidiaries which becomes a Subsidiary Guarantor to cause, all 
or substantially all personal property (other than any personal property 
expressly excluded from the definition of Collateral in the Security 
Agreement or other Collateral Document), to be subject at all times to 
perfected Liens in favor of the Collateral Agent pursuant to the Collateral 
Documents, or such other security agreements, pledge agreements, or similar 
collateral documents as the Collateral Agent shall reasonably request to 
create or perfect its Liens on the Collateral (collectively, the 
Additional Collateral Documents).  In the event that any Loan Party 
acquires any owned Real Property after the Closing Date having a fair 
market value in excess of $2,000,000, the Borrower agrees to promptly (but 
in no event later than 90 days after the acquisition thereof) provide the 
Administrative Agent with written notice of such acquisition, setting forth 
in reasonable detail the location and a description of the Real Property so 
acquired.  If requested by the Administrative Agent, the Borrower or the 
applicable Subsidiary Guarantor will cause to be delivered to the 
Collateral Agent with respect to such Real Property, a Mortgage or other 
appropriate instrument under applicable law sufficient to create a valid 
first priority Lien (except as otherwise permitted by the definition of 
Permitted Liens) of record on such Real Property including Surveys, Title 
Policies, local counsel opinions, flood insurance certificates, and other 
customary instruments, certificates and documents, as are in form and 
substance reasonably requested by the Collateral Agent.  Without limiting 
the generality of the foregoing, the Borrower will cause, and will cause 
each of its Subsidiaries that is or becomes a Subsidiary Guarantor to 
cause, 100% of the Equity Interests owned by them of each of their 
respective direct and indirect Domestic Subsidiaries (other than any (i) 
CFC Holdco or (ii) any Domestic Subsidiary of a CFC) and each of their 
respective Foreign Subsidiaries (that is not a CFC) or, with respect to 
each Foreign Subsidiary, directly owned by any Loan Party, that is a CFC or 
any Domestic Subsidiary, directly owned by any Loan Party, that is a CFC 
Holdco, 65% of each class of Equity Interests entitled to vote (within the 
meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.956-2(c)(2)) and 100% of each 
class of Equity Interests of such Subsidiary not entitled to vote (within 
the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.956-2(c)(2)) to be subject at 
all times to a first priority, perfected Lien in favor of the Collateral 
Agent, subject only to Permitted Liens described in Section 7.02(iii), 
(iv) or (xiv).
 
    (i)            All such security interests and mortgages shall be
    granted pursuant to documentation consistent with the Collateral
    Documents executed on the Closing Date and otherwise reasonably
    satisfactory in form and substance to the Collateral Agent and shall
    constitute valid and enforceable perfected security interests and
    mortgage liens subject to no other Liens except for Permitted Liens. 
    The Additional Collateral Documents or instruments related thereto
    shall have been duly recorded or filed in such manner and in such
    places as are required by law to establish, perfect, preserve and
    protect the Liens in favor of the Collateral Agent required to be
    granted pursuant to the Additional Collateral Documents, and all Taxes,
    fees and other charges payable in connection therewith shall have been
    paid in full.  The Borrower shall cause to be delivered to the
    Collateral Agent such opinions of counsel, title insurance and other
    related documents as may be reasonably requested by the Collateral
    Agent to assure itself that this Section 6.12(b) has been complied
    with.
     
    (ii)           Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section
    6.12(b), the Collateral Agent and the Borrower may exclude assets from
    the Collateral and that the Borrower shall not be required to deliver
    any Additional Collateral Documents, if, as reasonably determined by
    the Collateral Agent and the Borrower, the cost of obtaining or
    perfecting a security interest is excessive in relation to the benefit
    afforded to the Lenders thereby.
 
91
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
(c)           Real Property Appraisals.  If the Collateral Agent reasonably 
determines that it or the Lenders are required by Law or regulation to have 
appraisals prepared in respect of the owned Real Property of any Group 
Company constituting Collateral, the Borrower shall provide to the 
Collateral Agent appraisals which satisfy the applicable requirements set 
forth in 12 C.F.R., Part 34 - Subpart C or any successor or similar 
statute, rule, regulation, guideline or order, and which shall be in scope, 
form and substance compliant with such requirements.
 
(d)           Completion of Actions.  The Borrower agrees that each action 
required by Section 6.12(b) shall be completed as soon as reasonably 
practicable, but in no event later than 60 days (or such later date as 
determined by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion) after such 
action is either requested to be taken by the Collateral Agent or required 
to be taken by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to the 
terms of this Section 6.12.
 
Section 6.13         Further Assurances.
 
(a)           Promptly, upon the reasonable request of the Administrative 
Agent (on behalf of itself or of any Lender) or the Collateral Agent, at 
the Borrowers expense, execute, acknowledge and deliver, or cause the 
execution, acknowledgment and delivery of, and thereafter register, file or 
record, or cause to be registered, filed or recorded, in an appropriate 
governmental office, any document or instrument supplemental to or 
confirmatory of the Collateral Documents or otherwise deemed by the 
Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent reasonably necessary or 
desirable for the continued validity, perfection and priority of the Liens 
on the Collateral covered thereby subject to no other Liens except as 
permitted by the Finance Documents, in each case, to the extent not 
inconsistent with the terms of any Finance Document.
 
(b)           In connection with any change (i) in any Loan Partys legal 
name, (ii) in the location of the Borrowers chief executive office, (iii) 
in any Loan Partys organizational identification number, if any, or (iv) 
in any Loan Partys jurisdiction of organization (in each case, including 
by merging with or into any other entity, reorganizing, dissolving, 
liquidating, reorganizing or organizing in any other jurisdiction), (A) 
such Loan Party shall give the Collateral Agent and the Administrative 
Agent prompt written notice (which shall in any event be given within 30 
days, or such greater notice period agreed to in writing by the Collateral 
Agent in its sole discretion, after such change) clearly describing such 
change and providing such other information in connection therewith as the 
Collateral Agent or the Administrative Agent may reasonably request and (B) 
such Loan Party shall promptly take all action reasonably requested by the 
Collateral Agent to maintain the perfection and priority of the security 
interest of the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Finance Parties in 
the Collateral, if applicable.  The Borrower shall not, and shall not 
permit any other Loan Party to, in any event change its name, 
organizational structure or location (determined as provided in Section 
9-307 of the UCC), if such change would cause the Security Interest (as 
defined in the Security Agreement) in favor of the Collateral Agent, in any 
Collateral to lapse or cease to be perfected unless such Loan Party has 
taken on or before the date of lapse all actions necessary to ensure that 
such Security Interest in the Collateral does not lapse or cease to be 
perfected.  The Borrower agrees that it shall, and shall cause each Loan 
Party to, promptly and in any event within 30 days (or such longer period 
as may be agreed by the Collateral Agent in its sole discretion) of such 
change provide the Collateral Agent with certified Organization Documents 
reflecting any of the changes (other than location) described in the 
preceding sentence.
 
Section 6.14         Annual Lenders Conference Call.  Within 30 days after 
the delivery of the financial statements pursuant to Section 6.01(a) for 
each fiscal year of the Borrower, host a conference call with 
representatives of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, to be held at 
such time as reasonably designated by the Borrower (in consultation with 
the Administrative Agent), for the discussion of the financial results of 
the previous fiscal quarter and the year-to-date financial condition of the 
Group Companies, including a reasonable question and answer period.
 
92

Section 6.15         Maintenance of Ratings.  Use commercially reasonably 
efforts to cause the Loans and the Borrowers corporate credit to continue 
to be rated by S&P and Moodys (but not to maintain a specific rating).
 
Section 6.16         Post Closing Matters.  The Borrower and each of the 
Loan Parties, as applicable, will execute and deliver the documents and 
complete the tasks set forth on Schedule 6.16, in each case, within the 
time limits specified therein.

requirements of Law.

ARTICLE VIII
 
DEFAULTS
 
Section 8.01         Events of Default.  An Event of Default shall exist 
upon the occurrence of any of the following specified events or conditions 
(each an Event of Default):
 
(a)           Payment.  Any Loan Party shall:
 
    (i)            default in the payment when due (whether by scheduled
    maturity, acceleration or otherwise) of any principal of any of the
    Loans; or
     
    (ii)           default, and such default shall continue for three or
    more Business Days, in the payment when due of any interest on the
    Loans or of any fees or other amounts owing hereunder, under any of the
    other Loan Documents.
     
(b)           Representations.  Any representation or warranty made, or 
deemed to be made, by any Loan Party herein or in any of the other Loan 
Documents or in any certificate or notice delivered or required to be 
delivered pursuant hereto or thereto shall prove false in any material 
respect (to the extent that the representation or warranty is not already 
qualified by materiality, Material Adverse Effect or similar language) 
on the date as of which it was made or deemed to have been made.
 
(c)           Covenants.  Any Loan Party shall:
 
    (i)            default in the due performance or observance of any
    term, covenant or agreement contained in Section 6.05(i) (solely with
    respect to the Borrower), 6.11, 6.16, Article VII or Section
    10.01(c)(ii); or
     
    (ii)           default in the due performance or observance by it of
    any term, covenant or agreement contained in any Loan Document (other
    than those referred to in subsection (a), (b) or (c)(i) of this 
    Section 8.01) and such default shall continue unremedied for a period
    of 30 days after the earlier of a Responsible Officer of a Loan Party
    having becoming aware of such default or notice thereof having been
    given to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent.
     
(d)           Effectiveness.  Any material provision of any Loan Document, 
at any time after its execution, and for any reason other than as expressly 
permitted hereunder or thereunder (including as a result of a termination 
permitted under Section 7.04 or Section 7.05 or as a result of the acts or 
omissions of any Agent or Lender hereunder) or the Discharge of Senior 
Finance Obligations, ceases to be in full force and effect in any material 
respect, or any Loan Party contests in writing the validity or 
enforceability of any material provision of any Loan Document; or any Loan 
Party denies in writing that it has any further liability or obligation 
under any Loan Document (other than as a result of the Discharge of Senior 
Finance Obligations).
 
(e)           Cross-Default.
 
    (i)            Any Group Company (A) fails to make payment when due
    after lapse of all applicable grace periods (whether by scheduled
    maturity, required prepayment, acceleration, demand or otherwise),
    regardless of amount, in respect of any Indebtedness or Guaranty
    Obligation (other than in respect of (x) Indebtedness outstanding under
    the Loan Documents and (y) Swap Agreements) having an aggregate
    principal amount (including amounts owing to all creditors under any
    combined or syndicated credit arrangement) of more than the Threshold
    Amount, (B) fails to perform or observe
 
110
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
    any other condition or covenant, or any other event shall occur or
    condition shall exist, under any agreement or instrument relating to
    any such Indebtedness or Guaranty Obligation having an aggregate
    principal amount of more than the Threshold Amount, in the case of each
    of clauses (A) and (B) if the effect of such failure, event or
    condition is to cause, or to permit, after lapse of all applicable
    grace periods, the holder or holders or beneficiary or beneficiaries of
    such Indebtedness or Guaranty Obligation (or a trustee or agent on
    behalf of such holder or holders or beneficiary or beneficiaries) to
    cause, such Indebtedness to be declared to be due and payable prior to
    its stated maturity or to accelerate such stated maturity, or such
    Guaranty Obligation to become payable, or (C) shall fail to comply with
    the terms of any Indebtedness or Guaranty Obligation having an
    aggregate principal amount of more than the Threshold Amount requiring
    such Group Company to offer to prepay or repurchase such Indebtedness
    or the primary Indebtedness underlying such Guaranty Obligation prior
    to the stated maturity thereof; or
     
    (ii)           there occurs under any Swap Agreement or Swap Obligation
    an Early Termination Date (as defined in such Swap Agreement) resulting
    from (A) any event of default under such Swap Agreement as to which any
    Group Company is the Defaulting Party (as defined in such Swap
    Agreement) or (B) any Termination Event (as so defined) as to which any
    Group Company is an Affected Party (as so defined), and, in either
    event, the Swap Termination Value owed by a Group Company as a result
    thereof is greater than the Threshold Amount and such Group Company
    fails to pay such Swap Termination Value when due after applicable
    grace periods.
 
(f)            Insolvency Events.  (i) The Borrower or any Material 
Subsidiary shall commence a voluntary case or other proceeding seeking 
liquidation, reorganization or other relief with respect to itself or its 
debts under any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding now or hereafter in 
effect or seeking the appointment of a trustee, receiver, liquidator, 
custodian or other similar official of it or any substantial part of its 
property, or shall consent to any such relief or to the appointment of or 
taking possession by any such official in an involuntary case or other 
proceeding commenced against it, or shall make a general assignment for the 
benefit of creditors, or shall fail generally to pay its debts as they 
become due, or shall take any corporate action to authorize any of the 
foregoing or (ii) an involuntary case or other proceeding shall be 
commenced against the Borrower or any Material Subsidiary seeking 
liquidation, reorganization or other relief with respect to it or its debts 
under any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding now or hereafter in effect 
or seeking the appointment of a trustee, receiver, liquidator, custodian or 
other similar official of it or any substantial part of its property, and 
such involuntary case or other proceeding shall remain undismissed and 
unstayed for a period of 60 days, or any order for relief shall be entered 
against any Group Company under the federal bankruptcy laws as now or 
hereafter in effect.
 
(g)           Judgments.  One or more final judgments, orders, decrees or 
arbitration awards is entered against the Borrower or any Material 
Subsidiary involving in the aggregate a liability (to the extent not 
covered by independent third-party insurance or an indemnity from a 
creditworthy third party as to which the insurer or indemnitor, as 
applicable, does not deny coverage), as to any single or related series of 
transactions, incidents or conditions, in excess of the Threshold Amount, 
and the same shall not have been discharged, vacated or stayed pending 
appeal within 60 days after the entry thereof.
 
(h)           ERISA.  (i) An ERISA Event occurs which has resulted or would 
reasonably be expected to result in liability of any Group Company or any 
ERISA Affiliate in an aggregate amount reasonably likely to result in a 
Material Adverse Effect or (ii) any contribution required to be made with 
respect to an Employee Benefit Arrangement in accordance with any 
applicable law has not been made and the failure to make such contribution 
would reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.
 
(i)            Guaranties.  Any Guaranty given by any Loan Party or any 
provision thereof shall, except pursuant to the terms thereof, cease to be 
in full force and effect, or any Subsidiary Guarantor thereunder or any 
Person acting by or on behalf of such Subsidiary Guarantor shall deny or 
disaffirm such Subsidiary Guarantors obligations under such Guaranty.
 
111
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
(j)            Impairment of Collateral.  Any Collateral Document after 
delivery thereof pursuant to Section 4.01 or Section 6.12 shall for any 
reason (other than pursuant to the terms hereof or thereof including as a 
result of a transaction not prohibited under this Agreement) cease to 
create, or any Lien purported to be created by any Collateral Documents 
shall be asserted by any Loan Party not to be, a valid and perfected Lien 
with the priority required by the Collateral Document, on any material 
portion of the Collateral purported to be covered thereby, subject to 
Permitted Liens, except (i) to the extent such loss of perfection does not 
violate Section 6.12 or (ii) as to Collateral consisting of Real Property 
to the extent that such losses are covered by a lenders title insurance 
policy and such insurer has not denied coverage.
 
(k)           Ownership.  A Change of Control shall occur.
 
Section 8.02         Acceleration; Remedies.  Upon the occurrence of and 
during the continuation of an Event of Default, the Administrative Agent 
(or the Collateral Agent, as applicable) shall, at the request of, or may, 
with the consent of, the Required Lenders, take any or all of the following 
actions:
 
(a)           Termination of Commitments.  Declare the Commitments 
terminated whereupon the Commitments shall be immediately terminated.
 
(b)           Acceleration of Loans.  Declare the unpaid principal of and 
any accrued interest in respect of all Loans and any and all other 
indebtedness or obligations of any and every kind (other than contingent 
indemnification obligations) owing by a Loan Party to any of the Lenders 
hereunder to be due whereupon the same shall be immediately due and payable 
without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of 
which are hereby waived by the Loan Parties.
 
(c)           Enforcement of Rights.  Enforce any and all rights and 
interests created and existing under the Loan Documents, including, without 
limitation, all rights and remedies existing under the Loan Documents, all 
rights and remedies against each Subsidiary Guarantor and all rights of 
setoff.
 
(d)           Enforcement Rights Vested Solely in Administrative Agent and 
Collateral Agent.  The Lenders agree that this Agreement may be enforced 
only by the action of the Administrative Agent, acting upon the 
instructions of the Required Lenders, and, with respect to the Collateral, 
the Collateral Agent, and that no other Finance Party shall have any right 
individually to seek to enforce any Loan Document or to realize upon the 
security to be granted hereby.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Event of Default specified in Section 
8.01(f) shall occur, then the Commitments shall automatically terminate, 
all Loans, all accrued interest in respect thereof and all accrued and 
unpaid fees and other indebtedness or obligations owing to the Lenders 
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents shall immediately become due 
and payable, in each case without the giving of any notice or other action 
by the Administrative Agent or the Lenders, which notice or other action is 
expressly waived by the Loan Parties.
 
Section 8.03         Equity Cure Contribution.  Notwithstanding anything to 
the contrary contained in Section 8.01, for purposes of determining whether 
an Event of Default has occurred under the financial covenant set forth in 
Section 7.15, any cash equity contribution (in consideration of common 
equity or preferred equity (other than Disqualified Capital Stock)) made to 
the Borrower on or prior to the day that is 15 Business days after the day 
on which financial statements are required to be delivered for that fiscal 
quarter (the Cure Expiration Date) will, at the request (the Cure Notice
) of the Borrower given on or prior to the date, ten (10) Business Days 
following the date on which such financial statements are required to be 
delivered, be included in the calculation of Consolidated EBITDA solely for 
the purposes of determining compliance with the financial covenant at the 
end of such fiscal quarter and any subsequent period that includes such 
fiscal quarter (any such equity contribution, an Equity Cure Contribution
); provided that (a) the Borrower shall not be permitted to so request 
that an Equity Cure Contribution be included in the calculation of 
Consolidated EBITDA with respect to any fiscal quarter unless, after giving 
effect to such
 
112
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
requested Equity Cure Contribution, there will be at least two fiscal 
quarters in the Relevant Four Fiscal Quarter Period in which no Equity Cure 
Contribution has been made, (b) no more than five Equity Cure Contributions 
may be made during the life of the Loans, (c) the amount of any Equity Cure 
Contribution in any fiscal quarter will be no greater than the amount 
required to cause Borrower to be in compliance with the financial covenant 
set forth in Section 7.15 and (d) all Equity Cure Contributions will be 
disregarded for all purposes under the Loan Documents (including 
calculating Consolidated EBITDA and the Total Net Leverage Ratio for 
purposes of determining basket levels and other items governed by reference 
to Consolidated EBITDA or the Total Net Leverage Ratio) other than for 
retroactively determining compliance with the financial covenant at the end 
of such fiscal quarter and any subsequent period that includes such fiscal 
quarter.  To the extent that the proceeds of the Equity Cure Contribution 
are used to repay Indebtedness, such Indebtedness shall not be deemed to 
have been repaid for purposes of recalculating the financial covenant set 
forth in Section 7.15 for the most recently ended Relevant Four Fiscal 
Quarter Period.  For purposes of this paragraph, the term Relevant Four 
Fiscal Quarter Period shall mean, with respect to any requested Equity 
Cure Contribution, the four fiscal quarter period ending on (and including) 
the fiscal quarter in which Consolidated EBITDA will be increased as a 
result of such Equity Cure Contribution.  Notwithstanding anything to the 
contrary contained in Section 8.02, from and after the effectiveness of the 
Cure Notice neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender may exercise 
any rights or remedies under Section 8.02 (or under any other Loan 
Document) on the basis of the Event of Default under Section 7.15 (and any 
other Default as a result thereof), in each case, until and unless the Cure 
Expiration Date has occurred without the proceeds of the Equity Cure 
Contribution actually having been received in cash by the Borrower and the 
Borrower shall not be permitted to make any Borrowings hereunder during 
such period.
 
Section 8.04         Allocation of Payments After Event of Default.
 
(a)           Priority of Distributions.  The Borrower hereby irrevocably 
waives the right to direct the application of any and all payments in 
respect of its Finance Obligations and any proceeds of Collateral after the 
occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default and agrees 
that, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.09(c) and Section 2.14, 
after the exercise of remedies provided for in Section 8.02 (or after the 
Loans have automatically become immediately due and payable), all amounts 
collected or received on account of any Finance Obligation shall, subject 
to the provisions of Section 2.18, be applied by the Administrative Agent 
in the following order:
 
    FIRST, to pay interest on and then principal of any portion of the
    Loans that the Administrative Agent may have advanced on behalf of any
    Lender for which the Administrative Agent has not then been reimbursed
    by such Lender or the Borrower;
     
    SECOND, to the payment of all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
    expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) of the Administrative
    Agent or the Collateral Agent in connection with enforcing the rights
    of the Finance Parties under the Finance Documents, including all
    expenses of sale or other realization of or in respect of the
    Collateral, including reasonable compensation to the agents and counsel
    for the Collateral Agent, and all expenses, liabilities and advances
    incurred or made by the Collateral Agent in connection therewith, and
    any other obligations owing to the Collateral Agent in respect of sums
    advanced by the Collateral Agent to preserve the Collateral or to
    preserve its security interest in the Collateral;
     
    THIRD, to the payment of all costs and expenses of each of the Lenders
    in connection with enforcing its rights under the Loan Documents or
    otherwise with respect to the Senior Credit Obligations owing to such
    Lender, to the extent due and payable under Section 10.04 hereof.
     
    FOURTH, to the payment of all of the Senior Credit Obligations
    consisting of accrued fees and interest;
 
113
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
    FIFTH, except as set forth in clauses FIRST through FOURTH above, to
    the payment of the outstanding Senior Credit Obligations and Swap
    Obligations owing to any Finance Party, pro rata, as set forth below,
    with (i) an amount equal to the Senior Credit Obligations being paid to
    the Collateral Agent (in the case of Senior Credit Obligations owing to
    the Collateral Agent) or to the Administrative Agent (in the case of
    all other Senior Credit Obligations) for the account of the Lenders or
    any Agent, with the Collateral Agent, each Lender and the Agents
    receiving an amount equal to its outstanding Senior Credit Obligations,
    or, if the proceeds are insufficient to pay in full all Senior Credit
    Obligations, its Pro Rata Share of the amount remaining to be
    distributed, and (ii) an amount equal to the Swap Obligations being
    paid to the trustee, paying agent or other similar representative (each
    a Swap Representative) for the Swap Creditors, with each Swap
    Creditor receiving an amount equal to the outstanding Swap Obligations
    owed to it by the Loan Parties or, if the proceeds are insufficient to
    pay in full all such Swap Obligations, its Pro Rata Share of the amount
    remaining to be distributed; and
     
    SIXTH, to the payment of the surplus, if any, to whomever may be
    lawfully entitled to receive such surplus.
     
In carrying out the foregoing, (i) amounts received shall be applied in the 
numerical order provided until exhausted prior to application to the next 
succeeding category and (ii) each of the Finance Parties shall receive an 
amount equal to its Pro Rata Share (as defined below) of amounts available 
to be applied pursuant to clauses THIRD, FOURTH and FIFTH above.
 
(b)           Pro Rata Treatment.  For purposes of this Section 8.04, Pro 
Rata Share means, when calculating a Finance Partys portion of any 
distribution or amount, that amount (expressed as a percentage) equal to a 
fraction the numerator of which is the then unpaid amount of such Finance 
Partys Senior Credit Obligations or Swap Obligations, as the case may be, 
and the denominator of which is the then outstanding amount of all Senior 
Credit Obligations or Swap Obligations, as the case may be.  If any payment 
to any Finance Party of its Pro Rata Share of any distribution would result 
in overpayment to such Finance Party, such excess amount shall instead be 
distributed in respect of the unpaid Senior Credit Obligations or Swap 
Obligations, as the case may be, of the other Finance Parties, with each 
Finance Party whose Senior Credit Obligations or Swap Obligations, as the 
case may be, have not been paid in full to receive an amount equal to such 
excess amount multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the unpaid 
Senior Credit Obligations or Swap Obligations, as the case may be, of such 
Finance Party and the denominator of which is the unpaid Senior Credit 
Obligations or Swap Obligations, as the case may be, of all Finance Parties 
entitled to such distribution.
 
(c)           Reliance by Collateral Agent.  For purposes of applying 
payments received in accordance with this Section 8.04, the Collateral 
Agent shall be entitled to rely upon (i) the Administrative Agent under 
this Agreement and (ii) the Swap Representative, if any, for the Swap 
Creditors for a determination (which the Administrative Agent, each Swap 
Representative for any Swap Creditor and the Finance Parties agree (or 
shall agree) to provide upon request of the Collateral Agent) of the 
outstanding Senior Credit Obligations and Swap Obligations owed to the 
Agents, the Lenders or the Swap Creditors, as the case may be.  Unless it 
has actual knowledge (including by way of written notice from a Swap 
Creditor or any Swap Representatives thereof) to the contrary, the 
Collateral Agent, in acting hereunder, shall be entitled to assume that no 
Swap Agreements are in existence.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
ARTICLE IX
 
AGENCY PROVISIONS
 
Section 9.01         Appointment.
 
(a)           Each Lender hereby irrevocably designates and appoints each 
of the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent as an agent of such 
Lender under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.  Each Lender 
irrevocably authorizes each Agent, in such capacity, through its agents or 
employees, to take such actions on its behalf under the provisions of this 
Agreement and the other Loan Documents and to exercise such powers and 
perform such duties as are delegated to such Agent by the terms of this 
Agreement and the other Loan Documents, together with such actions and 
powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.  Other than the rights of the 
Borrower pursuant to Section 9.12(c), the provisions of this Article IX 
are solely for the benefit of the Agents and the Lenders, and no Loan Party 
shall have rights as a third party beneficiary of any such provisions.  
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Agents are hereby 
expressly authorized to execute any and all documents (including releases) 
with respect to the Collateral and any rights of the Senior Credit Parties 
with respect thereto as contemplated by and in accordance with the 
provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.  In performing 
its functions and duties hereunder, each Agent shall act solely as an agent 
of the Lenders and does not assume and shall not be deemed to have assumed 
any obligation towards or relationship of agency or trust with or for the 
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries.  The Lead Arranger, Bookrunner and any 
Agent described in the definition thereof may resign from such role at any 
time, with immediate effect, by giving prior written notice thereof to the 
Administrative Agent and the Borrower.  Without limiting the generality of 
the foregoing, the use of the term agent in this Agreement with reference 
to the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent is not intended to 
connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising 
under agency doctrine of any applicable law.  Instead, such term is used 
merely as a matter of market custom and is intended to create or reflect 
only an administrative relationship between independent contracting 
parties.
 
(b)           Each Lender irrevocably appoints each other Lender as its 
agent and bailee for the purpose of perfecting Liens (whether pursuant to 
Section 8-301(a)(2) of the UCC or otherwise), for the benefit of the Senior 
Credit Parties, in assets in which, in accordance with the UCC or any other 
applicable Laws a security interest can be perfected by possession or 
control.  Should any Lender (other than the Collateral Agent) obtain 
possession or control of any such Collateral, such Lender shall notify the 
Collateral Agent thereof, and, promptly following the Collateral Agents 
request therefor, shall deliver such Collateral to the Collateral Agent or 
otherwise deal with such Collateral in accordance with the Collateral 
Agents instructions.
 
Section 9.02         Agent in Its Individual Capacity.  Each person serving 
as an Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity 
as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were 
not an Agent, and the term Lender or Lenders shall, unless otherwise 
expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include the 
person serving as an Agent hereunder in its individual capacity.  Such 
person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as 
financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for, and generally 
engage in any kind of business with, any Group Company or Affiliate thereof 
as if it were not an Agent hereunder and without duty to account therefor 
to the Lenders.
 
Section 9.03         Exculpatory Provisions.  No Agent shall have any 
duties or obligations except those expressly set forth in the Loan 
Documents.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) no Agent 
shall be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of 
whether a Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) no Agent shall have 
any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary 
powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated by 
the Loan Documents that such Agent is required to exercise in writing by 
the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as 
shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 10.01); 
provided that no Agent shall be required to take any action that, in its 
opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose such Agent to liability 
or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable Laws including, for 
the avoidance of doubt any
 
115
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any Bankruptcy 
Law or that may effect a foreclosure, modification or termination of 
property of a Defaulting Lender under any Bankruptcy Law, and (c) except as 
expressly set forth in the Loan Documents, no Agent shall have any duty to 
disclose or shall be liable for the failure to disclose, any information 
relating to any Group Company or any of its Affiliates that is communicated 
to or obtained by the person serving as such Agent or any of its Affiliates 
in any capacity.  No Agent shall be liable for any action taken or not 
taken by it (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders 
(or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, 
or as any Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the 
circumstances as provided in Section 10.01) or (ii) in the absence of its 
own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of 
competent jurisdiction by a final and nonappealable judgment.  No Agent 
shall be deemed to have knowledge of any Default unless and until written 
notice thereof describing such default is given to such Agent by the 
Borrower or a Lender, and no Agent shall be responsible for or have any 
duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or 
representation made in or in connection with any Loan Document, (ii) the 
contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder 
or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance 
or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or 
conditions set forth in any Loan Document or the occurrence of any Default, 
(iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of any Loan 
Document or any other agreement, instrument or document or (v) the 
satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere in any 
Loan Document.  Each party to this Agreement acknowledges and agrees that 
the Administrative Agent may from time to time use one or more outside 
service providers for the tracking of all UCC financing statements (and/or 
other collateral related filings and registrations from time to time) 
required to be filed or recorded pursuant to the Loan Documents and the 
notification to the Administrative Agent, of, among other things, the 
upcoming lapse or expiration thereof, and that each of such service 
providers will be deemed to be acting at the request and on behalf of the 
Borrower and the other Loan Parties.  No Agent shall be liable for any 
action taken or not taken by any such service provider.  Neither any Agent 
nor any of its officers, partners, directors, employees or agents shall be 
liable to the Lenders for any action taken or omitted by any Agent under or 
in connection with any of the Loan Documents.  The Administrative Agent has 
no duty, responsibility or liability to monitor or enforce participations 
or other actions in respect of any person on the list of Disqualified 
Institutions, or otherwise take (or omit to take) any action with respect 
thereto.
 
Section 9.04         Reliance by Agents.  Each Agent shall be entitled to 
rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, 
request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other 
writing (including any electronic message, internet or intranet website 
posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have 
been signed, sent, or otherwise authenticated by a proper person.  Each 
Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally and believed by it 
to be made by a proper person, and shall not incur any liability for 
relying thereon.  In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to 
the making of a Loan that by its terms must be fulfilled to the 
satisfaction of a Lender, each Agent may presume that such condition is 
satisfactory to such Lender unless each Agent shall have received written 
notice to the contrary from such Lender prior to the making of such Loan.  
Each Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for 
Borrower), independent accountants and other advisors selected by it, and 
shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance 
with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or advisors.
 
Section 9.05         Delegation of Duties.  Each Agent may perform any and 
all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers under this Agreement 
or under any other Loan Document by or through, or delegate any and all 
such rights and powers to, any one or more sub-agents appointed by such 
Agent.  Each Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all of its 
duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective 
Affiliates.  The exculpatory, indemnification and other provisions of the 
preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the 
Affiliates of each Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply, without 
limiting the foregoing, to their respective activities in connection with 
the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as 
activities as Agent.  The Agents shall not be responsible for the 
negligence or misconduct of any sub-agent except to the extent that a court 
of competent jurisdiction
 
116
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
determines in a final and nonappealable judgment that such Agent acted with 
gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such sub-agent.
 
Section 9.06         Successor Agent.  Each Agent may resign as such at any 
time upon at least 30 days prior notice to the Lenders and the Borrower.  
Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right to 
appoint a successor Agent from among the Lenders, which successor Agent 
shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower (unless an Event of 
Default under Section 8.01(a) or (f) shall have occurred and be 
continuing).  If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required 
Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the 
retiring Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Agent 
may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Agent, which successor 
shall be a commercial banking institution organized under the laws of the 
United States (or any State thereof) or a United States branch or agency of 
a commercial banking institution, in each case, having combined capital and 
surplus of at least $500,000,000; provided that if such retiring Agent is 
unable to find a commercial banking institution that is willing to accept 
such appointment and which meets the qualifications set forth above, the 
retiring Agents resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become effective 
and the retiring (or retired) Agent shall be discharged from its duties and 
obligations under the Loan Documents, and the Lenders shall assume and 
perform all of the duties of the Agent under the Loan Documents until such 
time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Agent.
 
Upon the acceptance of its appointment as an Agent hereunder by a 
successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the 
rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent, and the 
retiring (or retired) Agent shall be discharged from its duties and 
obligations under the Loan Documents.  The fees payable by the Borrower to 
a successor Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor 
unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor.  After an 
Agents resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article IX, Section 
10.04 and Sections 10.08 to 10.15 shall continue in effect for the benefit 
of such retiring Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Affiliates in 
respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it 
was acting as Agent.
 
Section 9.07         Non-Reliance on Agents and Other Lenders.  Each Lender 
acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon any Agent 
or any other Lender or any of their respective Affiliates and based on such 
documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, conducted its own 
independent investigation of the financial condition and affairs of the 
Loan Parties and their Subsidiaries and made its own credit analysis and 
decision to enter into this Agreement.  Each Lender further represents and 
warrants that it has reviewed the Confidential Information Memorandum dated 
October 23, 2014 and each other document made available to it on the 
Platform in connection with this Agreement and has acknowledged and 
accepted the terms and conditions applicable to the recipients thereof 
(including any such terms and conditions set forth, or otherwise 
maintained, on the Platform with respect thereto).  Each Lender also 
acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon any 
Agent or any other Lender or any of their respective Affiliates and based 
on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem 
appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking 
action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or 
related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.
 
Section 9.08         Name Agents.  The parties hereto acknowledge that the 
Lead Arranger, the Bookrunner and the Documentation Agent hold such titles 
in name only, and that such titles confer no additional rights or 
obligations relative to those conferred on any Lender hereunder.
 
Section 9.09         Indemnification.  The Lenders severally agree to 
indemnify each Agent in its capacity as such and each of its Related 
Parties (to the extent not reimbursed by Borrower or the Subsidiary 
Guarantors and without limiting the obligation of Borrower or the 
Subsidiary Guarantors to do so), ratably according to their respective 
outstanding Loans and Commitments in effect on the date on which 
indemnification is sought under this Section 9.09 (or, if indemnification 
is sought after the date upon which all Commitments shall have terminated 
and the Loans and Reimbursement Obligations shall have been paid in
 
117
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
full, ratably in accordance with such outstanding Loans and Commitments as 
in effect immediately prior to such date), from and against any and all 
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, fines, penalties, actions, 
claims, suits, judgments, litigations, investigations, inquiries or 
proceedings, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever that 
may at any time (whether before or after the payment of the Loans and 
Reimbursement Obligations) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against 
such Agent or Related Party in any way relating to or arising out of, the 
Commitments, this Agreement, any of the other Loan Documents or any 
documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein, the 
Transactions or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby or 
thereby or any action taken or omitted by such Agent or Related Party under 
or in connection with any of the foregoing (IN ALL CASES, WHETHER OR NOT 
CAUSED OR ARISING, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, OUT OF THE COMPARATIVE, 
CONTRIBUTORY OR SOLE NEGLIGENCE OF ANY AGENT OR RELATED PARTY); provided 
that no Lender shall be liable for the payment of any portion of such 
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, claims, 
suits, judgments, litigations, investigations, inquiries or proceedings, 
costs, expenses or disbursements that are found by a final and 
nonappealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction to have 
directly resulted solely and directly from such Agents or Related Parties, 
as the case may be, gross negligence or willful misconduct.  The agreements 
in this Section 9.09 shall survive the payment of the Loans and all other 
amounts payable hereunder.
 
Section 9.10         Withholding Taxes.  To the extent required by any 
applicable Law, the Administrative Agent may withhold from any payment to 
any Lender an amount equivalent to any applicable withholding Taxes.  If 
the Internal Revenue Service or any other Governmental Authority asserts a 
claim that the Administrative Agent did not properly withhold Taxes from 
amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender because the appropriate 
form was not delivered or was not properly executed or because such Lender 
failed to notify the Administrative Agent of a change in circumstance which 
rendered the exemption from, or reduction of, withholding Taxes ineffective 
or for any other reason, or if Administrative Agent reasonably determines 
that a payment was made to a Lender pursuant to this Agreement without 
deduction of applicable withholding Tax from such payment, or if any Taxes 
paid or payable by Administrative Agent are attributable to a Lenders 
failure to comply with the provisions of Section 10.06(d) relating to the 
maintenance of a Participant Register, such Lender shall indemnify the 
Administrative Agent fully for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by 
the Administrative Agent as Taxes (whether or not such Taxes were correctly 
or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority) or 
otherwise, including any penalties or interest and together with all 
expenses (including legal expenses, allocated internal costs and 
out-of-pocket expenses) incurred, within 10 days after demand therefor. A 
certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any 
Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest 
error.  Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off 
and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any 
Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to the 
Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative 
Agent under this Section 9.10.
 
Section 9.11         Lenders Representations, Warranties and 
Acknowledgements.
 
(a)           Each Lender represents and warrants that it has made its own 
independent investigation of the financial condition and affairs of the 
Borrower and its Subsidiaries in connection with Borrowings hereunder and 
that it has made and shall continue to make its own appraisal of the 
creditworthiness of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries.  No Agent shall have 
any duty or responsibility, either initially or on a continuing basis, to 
make any such investigation or any such appraisal on behalf of Lenders or 
to provide any Lender with any credit or other information with respect 
thereto, whether coming into its possession before the making of the Loans 
or at any time or times thereafter, and no Agent shall have any 
responsibility with respect to the accuracy of or the completeness of any 
information provided to the Lenders.  Each Lender acknowledges that no 
Agent or Related Party of any Agent has made any representation or warranty 
to it.  Except for documents expressly required by any Loan Document to be 
transmitted by an Agent to the Lenders, no Agent shall have any duty or 
responsibility (either express or implied) to provide any Lender with any 
credit or other information concerning any Loan Party, including the 
business, prospects, operations, property, financial and
 
118
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
other condition or creditworthiness of any Loan Party or any Affiliate of a 
Loan Party, that may come in to the possession of an Agent or any of its 
Related Parties.
 
(b)                                 Each Lender, by delivering its 
signature page to this Agreement or an Assignment and Assumption and 
funding its Loan, shall be deemed to have acknowledged receipt of, and 
consented to and approved, each Loan Document and each other document 
required to be approved by any Agent, the Required Lenders or the Lenders, 
as applicable, on the Closing Date.
 
Section 9.12                            Collateral Documents and Guaranty.
 
(a)                                 Agents under Collateral Documents and 
Guaranty.  Each Senior Credit Party hereby further authorizes the 
Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, on behalf of 
and for the benefit of the Senior Credit Parties, to be the agent for and 
representative of the Senior Credit Parties with respect to the Guaranty, 
the Collateral and the Loan Documents; provided that neither the 
Administrative Agent nor the Collateral Agent shall owe any fiduciary duty, 
duty of loyalty, duty of care, duty of disclosure or any other obligation 
whatsoever to any holder of Senior Credit Obligations with respect to any 
Swap Agreement.  Subject to Section 10.01, without further written consent 
or authorization from any Senior Credit Party, the Administrative Agent or 
the Collateral Agent, as applicable, may execute any documents or 
instruments necessary to (i) in connection with a sale or Asset Disposition 
permitted by this Agreement, release any Lien encumbering any item of 
Collateral that is the subject of such sale or other Asset Disposition or 
to which the Required Lenders (or such other Lenders as may be required to 
give such consent under Section 10.01) have otherwise consented or (ii) 
release any Subsidiary Guarantor from the Guaranty pursuant to the terms of 
the Guaranty Agreement or with respect to which the Required Lenders (or 
such other Lenders as may be required to give such consent under Section 
10.01) have otherwise consented.
 
(b)                                 Right to Realize on Collateral and 
Enforce Guaranty.  Anything contained in any of the Loan Documents to the 
contrary notwithstanding, the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the 
Collateral Agent and each Senior Credit Party hereby agree that (i) no 
Senior Credit Party shall have any right individually to realize upon any 
of the Collateral or to enforce the Guaranty, it being understood and 
agreed that all powers, rights and remedies hereunder and under any of the 
Loan Documents may be exercised solely by the Administrative Agent or the 
Collateral Agent, as applicable, for the benefit of the Senior Credit 
Parties in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof and all powers, 
rights and remedies under the Collateral Documents may be exercised solely 
by the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Senior Credit Parties in 
accordance with the terms thereof, and (ii) in the event of a foreclosure 
or similar enforcement action by the Collateral Agent on any of the 
Collateral pursuant to a public or private sale or other disposition 
(including, without limitation, pursuant to Section 363(k), Section 
1129(b)(2)(a)(ii) or otherwise of the Bankruptcy Code), the Collateral 
Agent (or any Lender, except with respect to a credit bid pursuant to 
Section 363(k), Section 1129(b)(2)(a)(ii) or otherwise of the Bankruptcy 
Code,) may be the purchaser or licensor of any or all of such Collateral at 
any such sale or other disposition and the Collateral Agent, as agent for 
and representative of the Senior Credit Parties (but not any Lender or 
Lenders in its or their respective individual capacities) shall be 
entitled, upon instructions from the Required Lenders, for the purpose of 
bidding and making settlement or payment of the purchase price for all or 
any portion of the Collateral sold at any such sale or disposition, to use 
and apply any of the Senior Credit Obligations as a credit on account of 
the purchase price for any collateral payable by the Collateral Agent at 
such sale or other disposition.
 
(c)                                  Release of Collateral and Guarantees, 
Termination of Loan Documents.
 
    (i)                                     Notwithstanding anything to the
    contrary contained herein or in any other Loan Document, the
    Administrative Agent shall (without notice to, or vote or consent of,
    any Lender or any affiliate of any Lender in its capacity as a party to
    any Swap Agreement) take such actions as shall be required to release
    its security interest in any Collateral subject to any disposition
    permitted by the Loan Documents, and to release any guarantee
    obligations under any Loan Document of any person
 
119
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
    subject to such disposition, to the extent necessary to permit
    consummation of such disposition in accordance with the Loan Documents.
     
    (ii)                                  Notwithstanding anything to the
    contrary contained herein or any other Loan Document, upon the
    Discharge of the Senior Finance Obligations, the Administrative Agent
    shall (without notice to, or vote or consent of, any Lender, or any
    affiliate of any Lender in its capacity as a party to any Swap
    Agreement) take such actions as shall be required to release its
    security interest in all Collateral, and to release all Guaranty
    Obligations provided for in any Loan Document, whether or not on the
    date of such release there may be outstanding Senior Credit Obligations
    in respect of Swap Agreements.  Any such release of Guaranty
    Obligations shall be deemed subject to the provision that such Guaranty
    Obligations shall be reinstated if after such release any portion of
    any payment in respect of the Senior Credit Obligations guaranteed
    thereby shall be rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned
    upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or
    reorganization of the Borrower or any Subsidiary Guarantor, or upon or
    as a result of the appointment of a receiver, intervenor or conservator
    of, or trustee or similar officer for, the Borrower or any Subsidiary
    Guarantor or any substantial part of its property, or otherwise, all as
    though such payment had not been made.
     
    (iii)                               In each case as specified in this 
    Section 9.12(c), the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent
    will, at the Borrowers expense, execute and deliver to the applicable
    Loan Party such documents as such Loan Party may reasonably request to
    evidence the release of such item of Collateral from the assignment and
    security interest granted under the Collateral Documents, or to release
    such Guarantor from its obligations under the Guaranty, in each case in
    accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents and this Section
    9.12(c).
     
(d)                                 The Collateral Agent shall not be 
responsible for or have a duty to ascertain or inquire into any 
representation or warranty regarding the existence, value or collectability 
of the Collateral, the existence, priority or perfection of the Collateral 
Agents Lien thereon, or any certificate prepared by any Loan Party in 
connection therewith, nor shall the Collateral Agent be responsible or 
liable to the Lenders for any failure to monitor or maintain any portion of 
the Collateral.
 
Section 9.13                            Administrative Agent May File 
Bankruptcy Disclosure and Proofs of Claim.  In case of the pendency of any 
proceeding under any Bankruptcy Laws relative to any Loan Party, the 
Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan 
shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or 
otherwise and irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent shall have 
made any demand on Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered (but not 
obligated) by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise:
 
(a)                                 to file a verified statement pursuant 
to rule 2019 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure that, in its sole 
opinion, complies with such rules disclosure requirements for entities 
representing more than one creditor;
 
(b)                                 to file and prove a claim for the whole 
amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the 
Loans and all other Senior Credit Obligations that are owing and unpaid and 
to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to 
have the claims of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent (including any 
claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances 
of the Administrative Agent and its respective agents and counsel and all 
other amounts due the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.03 and 10.04) 
allowed in such judicial proceeding; and
 
(c)                                  to collect and receive any monies or 
other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute 
the same;
 
120
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or 
other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized 
by each Lender to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in 
the event that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such 
payments directly to the Lenders, to pay to the Administrative Agent any 
amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and 
advances of the Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any 
other amounts due the Administrative Agent under this Agreement.  To the 
extent that the payment of any such compensation, expenses, disbursements 
and advances of the Administrative Agent, its agents and counsel, and any 
other amounts due the Administrative Agent under this Agreement out of the 
estate in any such proceeding, shall be denied for any reason, payment of 
the same shall be secured by a Lien on, and shall be paid out of, any and 
all distributions, dividends, money, securities and other properties that 
the Lenders may be entitled to receive in such proceeding whether in 
liquidation or under any plan of reorganization or arrangement or 
otherwise.
 
Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative 
Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender 
any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition 
affecting the Senior Credit Obligations or the rights of any Lender or to 
authorize the Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any 
Lender in any such proceeding.

than at final maturity) shall be ratable among the Incremental Revolving 
Loans, (iii) any secured Refinancing Facility: (1) shall be subject an 
intercreditor agreement (a Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement) (the terms 
of which will be reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent) 
governing the relationship between such secured Refinancing Facility and 
the Loans and Commitments hereunder, (2) shall not be secured by any assets 
that do not also constitute Collateral hereunder and (3) may not be secured 
pursuant to security documentation that is more restrictive to the Borrower 
than the Loan Documents, (iv) there are no direct or indirect obligors or 
guarantors in respect of the Refinancing Facilities that are not Loan

(vi) the proceeds of any Refinancing Facility shall be applied, 
substantially concurrently with the incurrence thereof, to the pro rata 
repayment of the outstanding Loans (and to the permanent reduction in 
Commitments) being so refinanced, and (vii) the other terms and conditions 
of the Refinancing Facility (excluding pricing and optional prepayment or 
redemption terms) are substantially identical to, or less favorable to, 
investors providing the Refinancing Facility than those applicable to the 
Loans and/or Commitments being refinanced (except for covenants or other 
terms applicable only to periods after the latest final Maturity Date of 
the Loans or Commitments (or, in the case of a Refinancing Facility that is 
secured on a junior basis, or that is unsecured, prior to the date which is 
91 days after the longest then applicable Maturity Date) existing at the 
time of such refinancing), in each case as certified by the chief financial 
officer of the Borrower in good faith prior to such incurrence or issuance.

this Agreement and the other Loan Documents may be amended, modified or 
supplemented with the consent of the Administrative Agent and/or the

the consent of any other Lender if such amendment is delivered in order to 
effectuate any amendment, modification or supplement pursuant to the first 
proviso of Section 10.01(a).

    address (or its telecopier number, electronic email address or
    telephone number) set forth in its Administrative Questionnaire.
     
Notices sent by hand or overnight courier service, or mailed by certified 
or registered mail, shall be deemed to have been given when received; 
notices sent by telecopier shall be deemed to have been given when sent 
(except that, if not given during normal business hours for the recipient, 
shall be deemed to have been given at the opening of business on the next 
Business Day for the recipient).  Notices delivered through electronic 
communications to the extent provided in paragraph (b) below shall be 
effective as provided in said paragraph (b).
 
(b)                                 Electronic Communications.  Notices and 
other communications to the Agents and the Lenders hereunder may (subject 
to Section 10.02(d)) be delivered or furnished by electronic communication 
(including e-mail and Internet or intranet websites) pursuant to procedures 
approved by the Administrative Agent; provided that the foregoing shall not 
apply to notices to any Lender pursuant to Article II if such Lender has 
notified the Administrative Agent that it is incapable of receiving notices 
under such Article by electronic communication.  The Administrative Agent, 
the Collateral Agent or the Borrower may, in its discretion, agree to 
accept notices and other communications to it hereunder by electronic 
communications pursuant to procedures approved by it (including as set 
forth in Section 10.02(d), which shall be deemed to have been approved); 
provided that approval of additional procedures may be limited to 
particular notices or communications.
 
Unless the Administrative Agent otherwise prescribes, (i) notices and other 
communications sent to an e-mail address shall be deemed received upon the 
senders receipt of an acknowledgement from the intended recipient (such as 
by the return receipt requested function, as available, return e-mail or 
other written acknowledgement); provided that if such notice or other 
communication is not sent during the normal business hours of the 
recipient, such notice or communication shall be deemed to have been sent

(c)                                  Change of Address, etc.  Any party 
hereto may change its address or telecopier number for notices and other 
communications hereunder by notice to the other parties hereto.  In 
addition, each Lender agrees to notify the Administrative Agent from time 
to time to ensure that the Administrative Agent has on record (i) an 
effective address, contact name, telephone number, telecopier number and 
electronic mail address to which notices and other communications may be 
sent and (ii) accurate wire instructions for such Lender.
 
(d)                                 Posting.  Unless otherwise expressly 
set forth herein, each Loan Party hereby agrees that it will provide to the 
Administrative Agent all information, documents and other materials that it 
is obligated to furnish to the Administrative Agent pursuant to this 
Agreement and any other Loan Document, including all notices, requests, 
financial statements, financial and other reports, certificates and other

relates to a request for a new, or a conversion of an existing, Borrowing 
or other extension of credit (including any election of an interest rate or 
Interest Period relating thereto), (ii) relates to the payment of any 
principal or other amount due under this Agreement prior to the scheduled 
date therefor, (iii) provides notice of any Default under this Agreement or 
(iv) is required to be delivered to satisfy any condition precedent to the 
effectiveness of this Agreement and/or any borrowing or other extension of 
credit hereunder (all such non-excluded communications, collectively, the 
Communications; such excluded communications the Excluded Communication
s), by transmitting the Communications in an electronic/soft medium in a 
format reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent (and Microsoft 
Word, Excel and .pdf shall be deemed acceptable to the Administrative Agent 
on the date hereof) at such e-mail address(es) provided to the Borrower 
from time to time or in such other form, including hard copy delivery 
thereof, to the extent requested by Administrative Agent shall require at 
least five (5) Business Days prior to the due date thereof.  Nothing in 
this Section 10.02 shall prejudice the right of the
 
125
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Agents, any Lender or any Loan Party to give any notice or other 
communication pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document in any 
other manner expressly specified in this Agreement or any other Loan 
Document or, if to an Agent, as any such Agent shall require by advanced 
written notice.  Excluded Communications shall be delivered to the 
Administrative Agent by facsimile communication or as the Administrative 
Agent shall direct at least three (3) Business Days prior to such Excluded 
Communication.
 
To the extent consented to by the Administrative Agent in writing from time 
to time, the Administrative Agent agrees that receipt of the Communications 
by the Administrative Agent at its e-mail address(es) set forth above shall 
constitute effective delivery of such Communications to the Administrative 
Agent for purposes of the Loan Documents.
 
Each Loan Party further agrees that the Administrative Agent may make the 
Communications available to the Lenders by posting the Communications on a 
Platform.  The Platform is provided as is and as available.  The Agents 
do not warrant the accuracy or completeness of the Communications, or the 
adequacy of the Platform and expressly disclaim liability for errors or 
omissions in the Communications.  No warranty of any kind, express, implied 
or statutory, including, without limitation, any warranty of 
merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement of 
third party rights or freedom from viruses or other code defects, is made 
by any Agent in connection with the Communications or the Platform.  In no 
event shall the Administrative Agent or any of its Related Parties have any 
liability to the Loan Parties, any Lender, or any other Person for damages 
of any kind, including direct or indirect, special, incidental or 
consequential damages, losses or expenses (whether in tort, contract or 
otherwise) arising out of any Loan Partys or the Administrative Agents 
transmission of communications through the Internet, except to the extent 
the liability of such Person is found in a final non-appealable judgment by 
a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from such Persons or 
its Related Persons gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct or a 
material breach of such Persons obligations under the Loan Documents.
 
The Borrower hereby acknowledges that (i) the Administrative Agent and/or 
the Lead Arranger will make available to the Lenders materials and/or 
information provided by or on behalf of the Borrower hereunder 
(collectively, Borrower Materials) by posting the Borrower Materials on 
IntraLinks or another similar electronic system (the Platform) and (ii) 
certain of the Lenders may be public-side Lenders (i.e., Lenders that do 
not wish to receive material non-public information with respect to the 
Borrower or its securities) (each, a Public Lender).  The Borrower hereby 
agrees that so long as the Borrower is the issuer of any outstanding debt 
or equity securities that are issued pursuant to a public offering 
registered with the SEC or in a private placement for resale pursuant to 
Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or is actively 
contemplating issuing any such securities:  (i) no Borrower Materials are 
to be made available to Public Lenders unless clearly and conspicuously 
marked Public  Contains No Non-Public Information prominently on the 
first page thereof; and (ii) unless the Borrower Materials have been marked 
Public  Contains No Non-Public Information, the Borrower shall not be 
deemed to have authorized the Administrative Agent, the Lead Arranger and 
the Lenders to treat such Borrower Materials as not containing any material 
non-public information with respect to the Borrower or its securities for 
purposes of United States Federal and state securities laws (provided, 
however, that to the extent such Borrower Materials constitute Information, 
they shall be treated as set forth in Section 10.07).  All Borrower 
Materials that are marked Public  Contains No Non-Public Information are 
permitted to be made available through a portion of the Platform designated 
Public Investor, and the Administrative Agent and the Lead Arranger shall 
be entitled to treat any Borrower Materials that are not marked Public  
Contains No Non-Public Information as being suitable only for posting on a 
portion of the Platform not designated Public Investor.
 
Section 10.03                     No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies.  No 
failure by any Lender or by the Administrative Agent to exercise, and no 
delay by any such Person in exercising, any right, remedy, power or 
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single 
or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder 
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other 
right, remedy, power or privilege.  The rights, remedies, powers and 
privileges herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, 
remedies, powers and privileges provided by Law.

(a)                                 Costs and Expenses.  The Loan Parties, 
jointly and severally, agree to pay (i) all reasonable and documented 
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent, the Collateral 
Agent and the Lead Arranger and their respective Related Parties (including 
the reasonable and documented fees, charges and out-of-pocket disbursements 
of Jones Day, counsel for the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent 
and one local counsel (including, in each case, one firm of additional

actual or potential conflicts of interests) and reasonable and documented 
charges relating to the maintenance of the Platform in connection with the 
Loan Documents) in connection with the syndication and closing of the Loans 
provided for herein, the preparation, negotiation, execution, delivery and 
administration of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and, with 
respect to the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent only, any 
amendment, amendment and restatement, modification or waiver of the 
provisions hereof or thereof, including in connection with post-closing 
searches to confirm that security filings and recordations have been 
properly made and including any costs and expenses of the service provider 
referred to in Section 9.03 and in connection with the protection of its 
rights (A) in connection with this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, 
including its rights under this Section 10.04, or (B) including all such 
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred during any 
workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect of such Loans, (ii) all 
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the 
Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Lender (including the 
reasonable and documented fees, charges and disbursements of external

this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, including its rights under 
this Section 10.04, or (B) in connection with the Loans made hereunder, 
including all such reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses 
incurred during any workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect of 
such Loans and (iii) all documentary and similar taxes and charges in 
respect of the Loan Documents; provided however that, notwithstanding 
anything to the contrary in this Section 10.04(a), the Borrower will not be 
required to pay the fees and expenses of third party advisors to the 
Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Lender (other than 
counsel) retained without the consent of the Borrower or more than one 
counsel to the Lead Arranger, the Administrative Agent, the Collateral 
Agent and the Lenders, taken as a whole (plus one local counsel and one 
special counsel in each applicable specially and one or more firms of 
additional counsel as a result of any actual or potential conflicts of 
interest).
 
(b)                                 Indemnification by Borrower.  The 
Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent (and any sub-agent 
thereof), the Collateral Agent (and any sub-agent thereof), the Lead 
Arranger, the Bookrunner and each Lender, and each Related Party of any of 
the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an Indemnitee) 
against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, 
claims, damages, liabilities and related reasonable and documented 
out-of-pocket expenses (including the reasonable and documented fees, 
charges and disbursements of external counsel) incurred by any Indemnitee 
or asserted against any Indemnitee by any third party or by the Borrower or 
any other Loan Party arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of 
(i) the execution or delivery of this Agreement, any other Loan Document, 
or any amendment, amendment and restatement, modification or waiver of the 
provisions hereof or thereof, or any agreement or instrument contemplated 
hereby or thereby, the performance by the parties hereto of their 
respective obligations hereunder or thereunder or the consummation of the 
transactions contemplated hereby, thereby, or related thereto or, in the 
case of the Administrative Agent (and any sub-agent thereof) and its 
Related Parties only, the administration of this Agreement and the other 
Loan Documents, (ii) any Loan or the use or proposed use of the proceeds 
therefrom, (iii) any actual or alleged presence or Release or threatened 
Release of Hazardous Materials on, at, under or from any property owned,

prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any 
of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory, 
whether brought by a third party or by the Borrower or any other Loan 
Party, and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto; 
provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available 
to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related 
expenses (x) are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final 
and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence, bad 
faith or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee or its Related Parties, (y) 
result from such
 
127
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Indemnitees or its Related Partys material breach of such Indemnitees 
obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document or (z) disputes 
solely among Indemnitees not involving any act or omission of any Loan 
Party or any Affiliate thereof, other than any claims against an Indemnitee 
in its capacity or in fulfilling its role as an administrative agent, 
collateral agent (or, in each case, sub-agent) or arranger or any similar 
role under any Loan Document (as determined by a final, non-appealable 
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction); provided further that the 
Loan Parties shall not be required to reimburse the legal fees and expenses 
of more than one counsel for all Indemnitees, taken as a whole (in addition 
to one special counsel in each specialty area, up to one local counsel in 
each applicable local jurisdiction and any additional counsel for an 
Indemnitee reasonably deemed appropriate by virtue of actual or potential 
conflicts of interests incurred in connection with investigating, defending 
or preparing to defend any such action, suit, proceeding (including any 
inquiry or investigation).  No Loan Party shall be liable for any amounts 
hereunder (other than the amount of any reasonable and documented legal 
fees or other costs and expenses associated with the settlement) to the 
extent an Indemnitee has entered into any settlement without the Borrowers 
consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), 
provided that an Indemnitee may enter into a settlement if there is a 
judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction in any such proceeding, in 
which case the Borrower agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each 
Indemnified Person from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, 
liabilities and related expenses by reason of such settlement or judgment 
in accordance with the other provisions of this Section 10.04(b).  This 
Section 10.04(b) shall not apply with respect to Taxes other than any Taxes 
that represent losses, claims, damages, etc. arising from any non-Tax 
claim.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) each Indemnitee shall be 
obligated to refund and return promptly any and all amounts paid by the 
Borrower under this Section 10.04(b) to such Indemnitee for any such fees, 
expenses or damages to the extent such Indemnitee is not entitled to 
payment of such amounts in accordance with the terms hereof and (ii) the 
Borrower shall have no obligation to reimburse any Indemnitee, other than a 
party hereto or former party hereto as an Agent, Lead Arranger, Bookrunner 
or Lender or Related Party of an Agent, Lead Arranger, Bookrunner or 
Lender, unless such Indemnitee agrees to be bound by the foregoing clause 
(i).
 
(c)                                  Reimbursement by Lenders.  To the 
extent that the Borrower for any reason fails to indefeasibly pay any 
amount required under subsection (a) or (b) of this Section 10.04 to be 
paid by it or them to the Administrative Agent (or any sub-agent thereof), 
the Collateral Agent (or any sub-agent thereof) or any of their respective 
Related Parties, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative 
Agent (or any such sub-agent), the Collateral Agent (or any sub-agent 
thereof) or such Related Party, as the case may be, such Lenders 
Applicable Percentage (determined as of the time that the applicable 
unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount; 
provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, 
liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or 
asserted against the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent) or the 
Collateral Agent (or any sub-agent thereof), in its capacity as such, or 
against any Related Party of any of the foregoing acting for the 
Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent) or the Collateral Agent (or 
any sub-agent thereof) in connection with such capacity.  The obligations 
of the Lenders under this subsection (c) are subject to the provisions of 
Section 2.14.
 
(d)                                 Waiver of Consequential Damages, Etc.  
To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, no party hereto shall 
assert, and each party hereto hereby waives, any claim against any 
Indemnitee or other party hereto, on any theory of liability, for special, 
indirect, consequential (including, without limitation, any loss of 
profits, business or anticipated savings) or punitive damages (in each 
case, as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection 
with, or as a result of, this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any 
agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the transactions contemplated 
hereby or thereby, any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds 
thereof.  No Indemnitee referred to in subsection (b) above shall be liable 
for any damages arising from the use by unintended recipients of any 
information or other materials distributed by it through 
telecommunications, electronic or other information transmission systems in 
connection with this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or the 
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.
 
(e)                                  Payments.  All amounts due under this 
Section shall be payable not later than thirty (30) Business Days after 
demand therefor.
 
128
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
(f)                                   Survival.  The agreements in this 
Section shall survive the resignation of the Administrative Agent, the 
replacement of any Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the 
repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all the other Senior Credit 
Obligations.
 
Section 10.05                     Payments Set Aside.  To the extent that 
any payment by or on behalf of the Borrower or any other Loan Party is made 
to the Administrative Agent or any Lender, or the Administrative Agent or 
any Lender exercises its right of setoff, and such payment or the proceeds 
of such setoff or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to 
be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to 
any settlement entered into by the Administrative Agent or such Lender in 
its discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in 
connection with any proceeding under any Insolvency or Liquidation 
Proceeding or otherwise, then (i) to the extent of such recovery, the 
obligation or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be 
revived and continued in full force and effect as if such payment had not 
been made or such setoff had not occurred, and (ii) each Lender severally 
agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent upon demand its applicable share 
of any amount so recovered from or repaid by the Administrative Agent, plus 
interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such payment is 
made at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Effective Rate from 
time to time in effect.  The obligations of the Lenders under clause (ii) 
of the preceding sentence shall survive the payment in full of the Senior 
Credit Obligations and the termination of this Agreement.
 
Section 10.06                     Successors and Assigns.
 
(a)                                 Successors and Assigns Generally.  The 
provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit 
of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted 
hereby, except that no Loan Party may assign or otherwise transfer any of 
its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior consent of the 
Administrative Agent and each Lender other than in connection with 
transactions permitted hereunder, and no Lender may assign or otherwise 
transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder except (i) to an 
Eligible Assignee in accordance with the provisions of subsection (b) of 
this Section 10.06, (ii) by way of participation in accordance with the 
provisions of subsection (d) of this Section 10.06 or (iii) by way of 
pledge or assignment of a security interest subject to the restrictions of 
subsection (f) of this Section 10.06 (and any other attempted assignment or 
transfer by the Borrower or any Lender shall be null and void).  Nothing in 
this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any 
Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and 
assigns permitted hereby, Participants to the extent provided in 
subsection (d) of this Section 10.06 and, to the extent expressly 
contemplated hereby, the other Indemnitees) any legal or equitable right, 
remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.
 
(b)                                 Assignments by Lenders.  Any Lender may 
at any time assign to one or more Eligible Assignees all or a portion of 
its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion 
of its Commitments and the Loans at the time owing to it); provided, 
however, that:
 
    (i)                                     except in the case of any
    assignment in connection with the primary syndication of the
    Commitments and Loans made by Jefferies Finance LLC to an Eligible
    Assignee previously identified to the Borrower, or an assignment of the
    entire remaining amount of the assigning Lenders Commitment and the
    Loans of the applicable Class, as the case may be, owing to it or in
    the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an
    Approved Fund with respect to a Lender, the aggregate amount of any
    Term Loans of an assigning Lender subject to each such assignments,
    determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to
    such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent or, if Trade
    Date is specified in the Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade
    Date, shall not be less than $1,000,000 unless each of the
    Administrative Agent and, so long as no Event of Default under Section
    8.01(a) or (f) shall have occurred and is continuing, the Borrower
    otherwise consents (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld
    or delayed and provided that, if the consent of the Borrower is
    required, the Borrower shall be deemed so to have consented unless it
    shall object thereto by written notice to the Administrative Agent
    within ten (10) Business Days after the Borrower has received written
    notice thereof); provided, however,
 
129
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
    that concurrent assignments to members of an Assignee Group and
    concurrent assignments from members of an Assignee Group to a single
    Eligible Assignee (or to an Eligible Assignee and members of its
    Assignee Group) will be treated as a single assignment for purposes of
    determining whether such minimum amount has been met;
     
    (ii)                                  each partial assignment shall be
    made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning
    Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to
    the Loans or the Commitment assigned;
     
    (iii)                               the parties to each assignment
    shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and
    Assumption, together with all forms, certificates or other evidence
    each assignee is required to provide pursuant to Section 3.01(e) and a
    processing and recordation fee in the amount of $3,500.00; provided, 
    however, that the Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion,
    elect to waive such processing and recordation fee in the case of any
    assignment.  The assignee, if it is not a Lender, shall deliver to the
    Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire;
     
    (iv)                              No such assignment shall be made to
    any Defaulting Lender or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Person who,
    upon becoming a Lender hereunder, would constitute any of the foregoing
    Persons described in this subclause (iv);
     
    (v)                                 In connection with any assignment
    of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such
    assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the
    other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the
    assignment shall make such additional payments to the Administrative
    Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as
    appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee
    of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating actions,
    including funding, with the consent of the Borrower and the
    Administrative Agent, the applicable pro rata share of Loans previously
    requested but not funded by the Defaulting Lender, to each of which the
    applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (x)
    pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such
    Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder
    (and interest accrued thereon) and (y) acquire (and fund as
    appropriate) its full pro rata share of all Loans in accordance with
    its Applicable Percentage.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event
    that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender
    hereunder shall become effective under applicable Law without
    compliance with the provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of
    such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all
    purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs; and
     
    (vi)                              Any assignment or participation by a
    Lender to a Disqualified Institution shall be null and void without
    prior written notification to the Borrower and the Borrowers consent,
    and the Borrower shall be entitled to seek specific performance to
    unwind any such assignment or participation in addition to injunctive
    relief or any other remedies available to the Borrower at law or in
    equity; provided that, without prejudicing any right or remedy that the
    Borrower may otherwise have at law or in equity, to the extent such
    Disqualified Institution has assigned its Loans to an Eligible Assignee
    (which is not an Affiliate of such Disqualified Institution), at the
    Borrowers election (to be made by notice in writing to the
    Administrative Agent), the assignment to such Eligible Assignee shall
    be deemed effective for all purposes of the Loan Documents irrespective
    of such Disqualified Institution having previously held the applicable
    Loan.
     
Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent 
pursuant to subsection (c) of this Section, from and after the effective 
date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the Eligible Assignee 
thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the 
interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and 
obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender 
thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment 
and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, 
in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the
 
130
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender 
shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the 
benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.04, 3.05, and 10.04 with respect to facts and 
circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment).  
Upon request, the Borrower (at its expense) shall execute and deliver a 
Note or Notes to the assignee Lender.  Any assignment or transfer by a 
Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply 
with this subsection shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a 
sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in 
accordance with subsection (d) of this Section 10.06.
 
(c)                                  Register.  The Administrative Agent, 
acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain 
at the Administrative Agents Office a copy of each Assignment and 
Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names 
and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts 
(and related interest amounts) of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant 
to the terms hereof from time to time (the Register).  The Register shall 
record each transfer of the Loans to a transferee upon written notification 
by the registered owner of such transfer, provided, however, that failure 
to make any such recordation, or any error in such recordation, shall not 
affect any Lenders Commitments in respect of any Loan.  The entries in the 
Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the 
Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is 
recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder 
for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. 
 In addition, the Administrative Agent shall maintain on the Register 
information regarding the designation, and revocation of designation, of 
any Lender as a Defaulting Lender.  The Register shall be available for 
inspection by the Borrower, and the Collateral Agent at any reasonable time 
and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. The Register shall also 
be available for inspection by any Lender solely as it relates to its own 
interests and the interests of its Affiliates, at any reasonable time and 
from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.
 
(d)                                 Participations.  Any Lender may at any 
time, without the consent of, or notice to, the Borrower or the 
Administrative Agent sell participations to any Person (other than a 
natural Person, a Disqualified Institution, the Borrower or any of the 
Borrowers Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a Participant) in all or a 
portion of such Lenders rights and/or obligations under this Agreement 
(including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or the Loans owing to 
it); provided that in (i) such Lenders obligations under this Agreement 
shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to 
the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) 
the Borrower and the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall continue to 
deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lenders 
rights and obligations under this Agreement.  For the avoidance of doubt, 
each Lender shall be responsible for the indemnity under Section 9.10 with 
respect to any payments made by such Lender to its Participants.
 
Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a 
participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to 
enforce the Loan Documents and to approve any amendment, modification or 
waiver of any provision of the Loan Documents; provided that such agreement 
or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of 
the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described 
in the first proviso to Section 10.01 that directly and adversely affects 
such Participant.  Subject to subsection (e) of this Section, the Borrower 
agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 
3.01, 3.04, and 3.05 (subject to the requirements and limitations of such 
Sections, it being understood that any requirement for a Participant to 
deliver tax documentation or other information shall be satisfied upon the 
delivery of such tax documentation or other information to the 
participating Lender with no requirement for it to be delivered to the 
Borrower or the Administrative Agent) to the same extent as if it were a 
Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to subsection 
(b) of this Section.  To the extent permitted by Law, each Participant also 
shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.08 as though it were a 
Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.13 as 
though it were a Lender.
 
Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this 
purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on 
which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal 
amounts (and related interest amounts) of each participants interest in 
the Loans or other obligations under
 
131
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
this Agreement (the Participant Register); provided that, no Lender shall 
have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of any Participant 
Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information 
relating to a Participants interest in any Loans or other rights or 
obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent 
that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such Loan or other 
right or obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the 
U.S. Treasury Regulations.  The entries in the Participant Register shall 
be conclusive, absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each 
person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of 
such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any 
notice to the contrary.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative 
Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no 
responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.
 
No participation shall be or shall be deemed to be a discharge, rescission, 
extinguishment or substitution of any outstanding Loan and any Loan subject 
to a participation shall continue to be the same obligation and not a new 
obligation.
 
(e)                                  Limitations on Participant Rights.  A 
Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under 
Section 3.01 or 3.04 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to 
receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless 
the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the 
Borrowers prior written consent or the right to receive a greater payment 
results from a Change in Law after the participant becomes a Participant.
 
(f)                                   Certain Pledges.  Any Lender may at 
any time, without the consent of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, 
pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights 
under this Agreement (including under its Note, if any) to secure 
obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure 
obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or 
assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder 
or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party 
hereto.
 
(g)                                  Electronic Execution of Assignments.  
The words execution, signed, signature, and words of like import in 
any Assignment and Assumption shall be deemed to include electronic 
signatures or the keeping of records in electronic form, each of which 
shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability as a manually 
executed signature or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the 
case may be, to the extent and as provided for in any applicable Law, 
including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce 
Act, the New York State Electronic Signatures and Records Act, or any other 
similar state laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act.
 
Section 10.07                     Treatment of Certain Information; 
Confidentiality.  Each of the Agents and the Lenders agrees to maintain the 
confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that 
Information may be disclosed (a) to its Affiliates and to its and its 
Affiliates respective directors, officers, employees, legal counsel, 
independent auditors, professionals and other experts and agents 
(collectively, Representatives) (it being understood that the Persons to 
whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of 
such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential), (b) 
to the extent requested by any Governmental Authority or regulatory 
authority (including any self-regulatory authority, such as the National 
Association of Insurance Commissioners) having jurisdiction over such Agent 
or Lender or upon the good faith determination by counsel that such 
information should be disclosed in light of ongoing oversight or review by 
any Governmental Authority or regulatory authority (including any 
self-regulatory authority) having jurisdiction over such Agent or Lender 
(in which case, such Agent or such Lender, as applicable, shall to the 
extent practicable and permitted by law, rule or regulation, except with 
respect to any audit or examination conducted by accountants or any 
Governmental Authority or regulatory authority exercising examination or 
regulatory authority, promptly notify the Borrower, in advance, to the 
extent lawfully permitted to do so), (c) in any legal, judicial, 
administrative proceeding or other compulsory process or otherwise as 
required by applicable Law, rule or regulation (in which case, such Agent 
or such Lender, as applicable, shall promptly notify the Borrower, in 
advance, to the extent practicable and permitted by Law, rule or 
regulation, except in connection with any request as part of any regulatory 
audit or examination conducted by accountants or any
 
132
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Governmental Authority or regulatory authority exercising examination or 
regulatory authority), (d) to any Lender, Participant or any other party 
hereto, (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or 
under any other Loan Document or any action or proceeding relating to this 
Agreement or any other Loan Document or the enforcement of rights hereunder 
or thereunder, or to establish a due diligence defense, (f) (i) to any 
rating agency, provided that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made 
are informed of the confidential nature of the Information and instructed 
to keep such Information confidential, and (ii) subject to an agreement 
containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section 10.07
, to (other than a Disqualified Institution) (x) any assignee of or 
Participant in (or their Representatives, it being understood that the 
Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the 
confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such 
Information confidential), or any prospective assignee of or Participant in 
(or their Representatives, it being understood that the Persons to whom 
such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such 
Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential) any of 
its rights or obligations under this Agreement or (y) any actual or 
prospective counterparty (or its Representatives, it being understood that 
the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the 
confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such 
Information confidential) to any swap, derivative or securitization 
transaction relating to the Borrower and its obligations, (g) with the 
consent of the Borrower, (h) to the extent such Information (x) becomes 
publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section or 
(y) becomes available to any Agent, any Lender or any of their respective 
Affiliates on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Borrower 
and its Subsidiaries that is not to such Agents or Lenders knowledge 
subject to confidentiality obligations to the Borrower or any of its 
Subsidiaries, or (i) to the extent any such Information is independently 
developed by such Agent or Lender or any of its respective Representatives. 
 For purposes of this Section 10.07, Information means all information 
received from or on behalf of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries 
relating to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their 
respective businesses, other than any such information that is available to 
the Administrative Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to 
disclosure by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries.  Any Person required 
to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section 
shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such 
Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the 
confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own 
confidential information.
 
Section 10.08                     Right of Setoff.  If an Event of Default 
shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender and each of each 
Lenders Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, 
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, to set off and apply any 
and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final, 
in whatever currency) at any time held and other obligations (in whatever 
currency) at any time owing by such Lender or any such Affiliate to or for 
the credit or the account of the Borrower or any other Loan Party against 
any and all of the then due and owing obligations of the Borrower or such 
Loan Party, as applicable, now or hereafter existing under this Agreement 
or any other Loan Document to such Lender, irrespective of whether or not 
such Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement or any other 
Loan Document or are owed to a branch or office of such Lender different 
from the branch or office holding such deposit or obligated on such 
indebtedness; provided, that in the event that any Defaulting Lender shall 
exercise any such right of setoff, (x) all amounts so set off shall be paid 
over immediately to the Administrative Agent for further application in 
accordance with the provisions of Section 2.18 and, pending such payment, 
shall be segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other funds and 
deemed held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the 
Lenders, and (y) the Defaulting Lender shall provide promptly to the 
Administrative Agent a statement describing in reasonable detail the 
Obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender as to which it exercised such 
right of setoff.  The rights of each Lender and its respective Affiliates 
under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including 
other rights of setoff) that such Lender or its respective Affiliates may 
have.  Each Lender agrees to notify the Borrower and the Administrative 
Agent promptly after any such setoff and application; provided that the 
failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff 
and application.
 
Section 10.09                     Interest Rate Limitation.  
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any Loan Document, 
the interest paid or agreed to be paid under the Loan Documents shall not 
exceed the maximum rate of non-usurious interest permitted by applicable 
Law (the Maximum Rate).  If the
 
133
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Administrative Agent or any Lender shall receive interest in an amount that 
exceeds the Maximum Rate, the excess interest shall be applied to the 
principal of the Loans or, if it exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to 
the Borrower.  In determining whether the interest contracted for, charged, 
or received by the Administrative Agent or a Lender exceeds the Maximum 
Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (i) 
characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or 
premium rather than interest, (ii) exclude voluntary prepayments and the 
effects thereof and (iii) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal 
or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated 
term of the Senior Credit Obligations hereunder.
 
Section 10.10                     Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness
.  This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties 
hereto in different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an 
original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single 
contract.  This Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and any separate 
letter agreements with respect to fees payable to the Administrative Agent, 
constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject 
matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and 
understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof; 
provided that, notwithstanding anything contained herein, the Commitment 
Letter and the Fee Letter shall survive the Closing Date pursuant to the 
terms thereof to the extent expressly set forth therein.  Except as 
provided in Section 4.01, this Agreement shall become effective when it 
shall have been executed by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent and 
when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof that, 
when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties 
hereto.  Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this 
Agreement by telecopier or via email as an attachment of a .pdf document 
shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this 
Agreement.
 
Section 10.11                     Survival of Agreement.  All covenants, 
agreements, representations and warranties made by the Loan Parties in the 
Loan Documents and in the certificates or other instruments delivered in 
connection with or pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document 
shall be considered to have been relied upon by the other parties hereto 
and shall survive the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents and the 
making of any Loans, regardless of any investigation made by any such other 
party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Agents or any Lender 
may have had notice or knowledge of any Default, Event of Default, or 
incorrect representation or warranty at the time of any Borrowing, and 
shall continue in full force and effect until the Discharge of Senior 
Credit Obligations (other than contingent indemnification obligations).  
The provisions of Sections 2.14, 3.01, 3.04, 3.05, 10.04, and Sections 
10.10 through 10.18 (other than 10.16) shall survive and remain in full 
force and effect regardless of the repayment of the Loans, the expiration 
or termination of and the Commitments or the termination of this Agreement 
or any provision hereof.
 
Section 10.12                     Severability.  Any provision of this 
Agreement held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction 
shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such 
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity, 
legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof; and the 
invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not 
invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction.  Without limiting the 
foregoing provisions of this Section 10.12, if and to the extent that the 
enforceability of any provisions in this Agreement relating to Defaulting 
Lenders shall be limited by Debtor Relief Laws, as determined in good faith 
by the Administrative Agent then such provisions shall be deemed to be in 
effect only to the extent not so limited.
 
Section 10.13                     Replacement of Lenders.  If (a) any 
Lender (including on behalf of a Participant) requests compensation under 
Section 3.04, (b) the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to 
any Lender (including on behalf of a Participant) or any Governmental 
Authority for the account of any Lender (or Participant, as applicable) 
pursuant to Section 3.01, (c) the obligation of any Lender to make 
Eurodollar Loans has been suspended pursuant to Section 3.02, (d) any 
Lender is a Defaulting Lender or (e) any Lender has failed to consent to a 
proposed amendment, waiver, consent, discharge or termination which 
pursuant to the terms of Section 10.01 or any other provision of any Loan 
Document requires the consent of all of the Lenders of a Class or Classes 
or the consent of all Lenders directly affected thereby and with respect to 
which the Required Lenders of such Class or Classes shall have granted 
their consent, the Borrower shall have the right,
 
134
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the 
Administrative Agent, to replace such Lender by requiring such Lender to 
assign and delegate, without recourse (other than as set forth herein, in 
accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents 
required by, Section 10.06), all of its interests, rights (other than its 
existing rights to payments pursuant to Section 3.01 or Section 3.04) and 
obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to an 
Eligible Assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be 
another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided that:
 
    (i)                                     the Borrower shall have paid to
    the Administrative Agent the assignment fee specified in Section
    10.06(b) (unless waived by the Administrative Agent);
     
    (ii)                                  such Lender shall have received
    payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal amount of its
    Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts
    payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including
    any amounts under Section 3.05 and Section 2.09(g), if applicable) from
    the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued
    interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts);
     
    (iii)                               in the case of any such assignment
    resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 3.04 or payments
    required to be made pursuant to Section 3.01, such assignment will
    result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter;
     
    (iv)                              such assignment does not conflict
    with applicable Laws; and

    Lenders under the circumstances described in clause (e) above, the
    applicable amendment, waiver, consent, discharge or termination that
    the Borrower has requested shall become effective upon giving effect to
    such replacement (and any related Assignment and Assumptions required
    to be effected in connection therewith in accordance with this Section
    10.13).
     
A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation 
if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the 
circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and 
delegation cease to apply.  If a replaced Lender does not execute an 
Assignment and Assumption pursuant to Section 10.06 within five (5) 
Business Days after receipt by such replaced Lender of notice of 
replacement pursuant to this Section 10.13, the Administrative Agent shall 
be entitled (but not obligated) to execute such an Assignment and 
Assumption on behalf of such replaced Lender, and any such Assignment and 
Assumption so executed by the Administrative Agent on behalf of such 
replaced Lender, the replacement Lender and the Administrative Agent shall 
be effective for purposes of this Section 10.13 and Section 10.06.

a banking regulatory authority regulating such affiliated depository 
institution or foreign bank) shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the

Lender is not a shell and certifying to other matters as required by 
Section 313 of the Patriot Act and the applicable regulations thereunder:  
(i) within 10 days after the Closing Date or, if later, the date such

required under the Patriot Act.
 
Section 10.17                     No Advisory or Fiduciary Responsibility.

Borrower acknowledges and agrees, and acknowledges its Affiliates 
understanding, that: (i) the credit facilities provided for hereunder and 
any related arranging or other services in connection therewith (including 
in connection with any amendment, waiver or other modification hereof or of 
any other Loan Document) are an arms-length commercial transaction between 
the Borrower and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Agents, the Lead 
Arranger, on the other hand, and the Borrower is capable of evaluating and 
understanding and understands and accepts the terms, risks and conditions 
of the transactions
 
136
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
contemplated hereby and by the other Loan Documents (including any 
amendment, waiver or other modification hereof or thereof); (ii) other than 
as set forth in the Commitment Letter, in connection with the process 
leading to such transaction, each Agent, the Lead Arranger and each Lender 
is and has been acting solely as a principal and is not the financial 
advisor, agent or fiduciary, for the Borrower or any of its Affiliates, 
stockholders, creditors or employees or any other Person; (iii) neither the 
Agents nor the Lead Arranger has assumed or will assume an advisory, agency 
or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Borrower with respect to any of 
the transactions contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto, 
including with respect to any amendment, waiver or other modification 
hereof or of any other Loan Document (irrespective of whether the 
Administrative Agent or the Arranger has advised or is currently advising 
the Borrower or any of its Affiliates on other matters) and neither the 
Agents nor the Lead Arranger has any obligation to the Borrower or any of 
its Affiliates with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby except 
those obligations expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan 
Documents; (iv) the Agents and the Lead Arranger and their respective 
Affiliates may be engaged in a broad range of transactions that involve 
interests that differ from those of the Borrower and its Affiliates, and 
neither the Agents nor the Lead Arranger has any obligation to disclose any 
of such interests by virtue of any advisory, agency or fiduciary 
relationship; and (v) the Administrative Agent and the Lead Arranger have 
not provided and will not provide any legal, accounting, regulatory or tax 
advice with respect to any of the transactions contemplated hereby 
(including any amendment, waiver or other modification hereof or of any 
other Loan Document) and each of the Borrower has consulted its own legal, 
accounting, regulatory and tax advisors to the extent it has deemed 
appropriate.  The Borrower hereby waives and releases, to the fullest 
extent permitted by law, any claims that it may have against the Agents and 
the Lead Arranger with respect to any breach or alleged breach of agency or 
fiduciary duty.
 
Section 10.18                     Judgment Currency.
 
(a)                                 The obligations of the Loan Parties 
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents to make payments in a 
specified currency (the Obligation Currency) shall not be discharged or 
satisfied by any tender or recovery pursuant to any judgment expressed in 
or converted into any currency other than the Obligation Currency, except 
to the extent that such tender or recovery results in the effective receipt 
by a Finance Party of the full amount of the Obligation Currency expressed 
to be payable to it under this Agreement or another Loan Document.  If, for 
the purpose of obtaining or enforcing judgment against any Loan Party in 
any court or in any jurisdiction, it becomes necessary to convert into or 
from any currency other than the Obligation Currency (such other currency 
being hereinafter referred to as the Judgment Currency) an amount due in 
the Obligation Currency, the conversion shall be made, at the rate of 
exchange (as quoted by the Administrative Agent or if the Administrative 
Agent does not quote a rate of exchange on such currency, by a known dealer 
in such currency designated by the Administrative Agent) determined, in 
each case, as of the Business Day immediately preceding the date on which 
the judgment is given (such Business Day being hereinafter referred to as 
the Judgment Currency Conversion Date).
 
(b)                                 If there is a change in the rate of 
exchange prevailing between the Judgment Currency Conversion Date and the 
date of actual payment of the amount due, the Borrower covenants and agrees 
to pay, or cause to be paid, or remit, or cause to be remitted, such 
additional amounts, if any (but in any event not a lesser amount), as may 
be necessary to ensure that the amount paid in the Judgment Currency, when 
converted at the rate of exchange prevailing on the date of payment, will 
produce the amount of the Obligation Currency which could have been 
purchased with the amount of Judgment Currency stipulated in the judgment 
or judicial award at the rate of exchange prevailing on the Judgment 
Currency Conversion Date.
 
(c)                                  For purposes of determining any rate 
of exchange or currency equivalent for this Section 10.18, such amounts 
shall include any premium and costs payable in connection with the purchase 
of the Obligation Currency.

or endorsement shall not affect the obligations of the Borrower to make a 
payment when due of any amount owing under the Credit Agreement or under 
this Term Note in respect of the Term Loan evidenced by this Term Note.
 
This Term Note is secured and guaranteed as provided in the Credit 
Agreement and the Collateral Documents.  Reference is hereby made to the

FOR VALUE RECEIVED, AMAG PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. (the Borrower), and its 
Subsidiaries (collectively, the Group Members and each, a Group Member
) which is a party to this subordinated intercompany note (this 
Promissory Note) promise to pay to the order of such other Group Member 
that makes loans or advances to such Group Member (each Group Member which 
borrows money pursuant to this Promissory Note is referred to herein as a 
Payor and each Group Member which makes loans and advances pursuant to 
this Promissory Note is referred to herein as a Payee), on demand, in 
lawful money as may be agreed upon from time to time by the relevant Payor 
and Payee, in immediately available funds and at the appropriate office of 
the Payee, the aggregate unpaid principal amount of all loans and advances 
heretofore and hereafter made by such Payee to such Payor and any other 
indebtedness now or hereafter owing by such Payor to such Payee as shown in 
the books and records of such Payee.  The failure to show any such 
indebtedness or any error in showing such Indebtedness in such books and 
records shall not affect the obligations of any Payor hereunder.  
Capitalized terms used herein but not otherwise defined herein shall have 
the meanings given such terms in the Credit Agreement dated as of November 
12, 2014 (as it may be amended, amended and restated, supplemented or 
otherwise modified from time to time, the Credit Agreement), among the 
Borrower, the Lenders from time to time party thereto, and JEFFERIES 
FINANCE LLC, as Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent thereunder (the 
Collateral Agent).
 
The unpaid principal amount hereof from time to time outstanding shall bear 
interest at a rate equal to the rate as may be agreed upon from time to 
time by the relevant Payor and Payee.  Interest shall be due and payable at 
such times as may be agreed upon from time to time by the relevant Payor 
and Payee.  Upon demand for payment of any principal amount hereof, accrued 
but unpaid interest on such principal amount shall also be due and payable. 
 Interest shall be paid in any lawful currency as may be agreed upon by the 
relevant Payor and Payee and in immediately available funds.  Interest 
shall be computed for the actual number of days elapsed on the basis of a 
year consisting of 365 days.
 
Each Payor and any endorser of this Promissory Note (to the extent 
permitted by applicable law) hereby waives presentment, demand, protest and 
notice of any kind.  No failure to exercise, and no delay in exercising, 
any rights hereunder on the part of the holder hereof shall operate as a 
waiver of such rights.
 
This Promissory Note has been pledged by each Payee that is a Loan Party to 
the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Finance Parties, as security 
for such Payees obligations, if any, under the Finance Documents to which 
such Payee is a party.  Each Payor acknowledges and agrees that after the 
occurrence of and during the continuation of an Event of Default, the 
Collateral Agent and the other Finance Parties may exercise all the rights 
of each Payee that is a Loan Party under this Promissory Note in accordance 
with the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement and the other Finance 
Documents and will not be subject to any abatement, reduction, recoupment, 
defense, setoff or counterclaim available to such Payor.
 
Each Payee agrees that any and all claims of such Payee against any Payor 
that is a Loan Party or any endorser of the obligations of any Payor that 
is a Loan Party under this Promissory Note, or against any of their 
respective properties, shall be subordinate and subject in right of payment 
to the Finance Obligations until the Discharge of Senior Finance 
Obligations; provided, that each Payor that is a Loan
 
Exhibit H-1
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Party may make payments to the applicable Payee except that if an Event of 
Default shall have occurred and be continuing payments under this 
Promissory Note by any Payor that is a Loan Party to any Payee that is not 
a Loan Party shall be prohibited following a written request therefor to 
the Borrower from the Required Lenders or the Administrative Agent 
(provided no such notice need be given and payments shall be prohibited 
automatically upon the occurrence and during the continuation of any 
Default or Event of Default under Section 8.01(f) of the Credit Agreement); 
and provided, further, that all loans and advances made by a Payee pursuant 
to this Promissory Note shall be received by the applicable Payor subject 
to the provisions of the Finance Documents.  Notwithstanding any right of 
any Payee to ask, demand, sue for, take or receive any payment from any 
Payor, all rights, Liens and security interests of such Payee, whether now 
or hereafter arising and howsoever existing, in any assets of any Payor 
that is a Loan Party (whether constituting part of the security or 
collateral given to any Finance Party to secure payment of all or any part 
of the Finance Obligations or otherwise) shall be and hereby are 
subordinated to the rights of the Finance Parties in such assets.  Except 
as expressly permitted by the Finance Documents, the Payees shall have no 
right to possession of any such asset or to foreclose upon, or exercise any 
other remedy in respect of, any such asset, whether by judicial action or 
otherwise, unless and until the Discharge of Senior Finance Obligations.
 
After the occurrence of and during the continuation of an Event of Default, 
if all or any part of the assets of any Payor, or the proceeds thereof, are 
subject to any distribution, division or application to the creditors of 
any Payor, whether partial or complete, voluntary or involuntary, and 
whether by reason of liquidation, bankruptcy, arrangement, receivership, 
assignment for the benefit of creditors or any other action or proceeding, 
or if (except as expressly permitted by the Finance Documents) the business 
of any Payor is dissolved or if (except as expressly permitted by the 
Finance Documents) all or substantially all of the assets of any Payor are 
sold, then, and in any such event, any payment or distribution of any kind 
or character, whether in cash, securities or other investment property, or 
otherwise, which shall be payable or deliverable upon or with respect to 
any indebtedness of such Payor to any Payee (Payor Indebtedness) shall be 
paid or delivered directly to the Collateral Agent for application to any 
of the Finance Obligations, due or to become due, until the Discharge of 
Senior Finance Obligations.  After the occurrence of and during the 
continuation of an Event of Default, each Payee that is a Loan Party 
irrevocably authorizes, empowers and appoints the Collateral Agent as such 
Payees attorney-in-fact (which appointment is coupled with an interest and 
is irrevocable) to demand, sue for, collect and receive every such payment 
or distribution and give acquittance therefor and to make and present for 
and on behalf of such Payee such proofs of claim and take such other 
action, in the Collateral Agents own names or in the name of such Payee or 
otherwise, as the Collateral Agent may deem necessary or advisable for the 
enforcement of this Promissory Note.  After the occurrence of and during 
the continuation of an Event of Default, each Payee that is a Loan Party 
also agrees to execute, verify, deliver and file any such proofs of claim 
in respect of the Payor Indebtedness reasonably requested by the Collateral 
Agent.  After the occurrence of and during the continuation of an Event of 
Default, the Collateral Agent may vote such proofs of claim in any such 
proceeding (and the applicable Payee shall not be entitled to withdraw such 
vote), receive and collect any and all dividends or other payments or 
disbursements made on Payor Indebtedness in whatever form the same may be 
paid or issued and apply the same on account of any of the Finance 
Obligations in accordance with the Credit Agreement.  Upon the occurrence 
and during the continuation of any Event of Default specified in Section 
8.01(f) of the Credit Agreement and upon the occurrence and during the 
continuation of any other Event of Default and upon written request from 
the Required Lenders of the Administrative Agent, should any payment, 
distribution, security or other investment property or instrument or any 
proceeds thereof be received by any Payee that is a Loan Party upon or with 
respect to Payor Indebtedness owing to such Payee prior to the Discharge of 
Senior Finance Obligations, such Payee that is a Loan Party shall receive 
and hold the same for the benefit of the Finance Parties, and shall 
forthwith deliver the same to the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the 
Finance Parties, in precisely the form received (except for the endorsement 
or assignment of such Payee where necessary or advisable in the Collateral 
Agents judgment), for
 
Exhibit H-2

application to any of the Finance Obligations in accordance with the Credit 
Agreement, due or not due, and, until so delivered, the same shall be 
segregated from the other assets of such Payee for the benefit of the 
Finance Parties.  Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an 
Event of Default, if such Payee fails to make any such endorsement or 
assignment to the Collateral Agent, the Collateral Agent or any of its 
officers, employees or representatives are hereby irrevocably authorized to 
make the same.  Each Payee that is a Loan Party agrees that until the 
Discharge of Senior Finance Obligations, such Payee will not (i) except as 
permitted by the Finance Documents, assign or transfer, or agree to assign 
or transfer, to any Person (other than in favor of the Collateral Agent for 
the benefit of the Finance Parties pursuant to the Pledge Agreement or 
otherwise) any claim such Payee has or may have against any Payor, or (ii) 
upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, 
discount or extend the time for payment of any Payor Indebtedness, or (iii) 
otherwise amend, modify, supplement, waive or fail to enforce any provision 
of this Promissory Note.
 
The Finance Parties shall be third party beneficiaries hereof and shall be 
entitled to enforce the subordination and other provisions hereof.
 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in any other 
Finance Document or in any such promissory note or other instrument, until 
the Discharge of Senior Finance Obligations, this Promissory Note shall not 
be deemed replaced, superseded or in any way modified by any promissory 
note or other instrument entered into on or after the date hereof which 
purports to create or evidence any loan or advance by any Group Member to 
any other Group Member.
 
THIS PROMISSORY NOTE SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND GOVERNED BY 
THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.
 
From time to time after the date hereof, additional Subsidiaries of the 
Group Members may become parties hereto by executing a counterpart 
signature page to this Promissory Note (each additional Subsidiary, an 
Additional Payor).  Upon delivery of such counterpart signature page to 
the Payees, notice of which is hereby waived by the other Payors, each 
Additional Payor shall be a Payor and shall be as fully a party hereto as 
if such Additional Payor were an original signatory hereof.  Each Payor 
expressly agrees that its obligations arising hereunder shall not be 
affected or diminished by the addition or release of any other Payor 
hereunder.  This Promissory Note shall be fully effective as to any Payor 
that is or becomes a party hereto regardless of whether any other Person 
becomes or fails to become or ceases to be a Payor hereunder.
 
This Promissory Note may be executed in any number of counterparts and by 
different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so 
executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken together 
shall constitute one and the same agreement.

Pursuant to Section 4.01(i) of the Credit Agreement, dated as of the date 
hereof (as amended, restated, amended and restated, supplemented or 
otherwise modified from time to time, the Credit Agreement), among AMAG 
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the Borrower), as the 
Borrower, each financial institution from time to time party hereto 
(collectively, the Lenders and individually, a Lender), and Jefferies 
Finance LLC, as Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent, [                
                    ], the undersigned [chief accounting officer][other 
officer with equivalent duties] of the Borrower hereby certifies as of the 
date hereof, solely on behalf of the Borrower and not in his or her 
individual capacity and without assuming any personal liability whatsoever, 
that:
 
I am familiar with the finances, properties, businesses and assets of the 
Borrower and its Subsidiaries and the Target and its Subsidiaries.  I have 
reviewed the Loan Documents and such other documentation and information 
and have made such investigation and inquiries as I have deemed necessary 
and prudent therefor.  I have also reviewed the consolidated financial 
statements of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries and the Target and its 
Subsidiaries, including projected financial statements and forecasts 
relating to statements of operations and cash flow statements of the 
Borrower and its Subsidiaries and the Target and its Subsidiaries, 
respectively.
 
On the Closing Date, after giving effect to the Transactions, the Borrower 
and its Subsidiaries (on a consolidated basis) (a) have property with fair 
value greater than the total amount of their debts and liabilities, 
contingent (it being understood that the amount of contingent liabilities 
at any time shall be computed as the amount that, in light of all the facts 
and circumstances existing at such time, represents the amount that can 
reasonably be expected to become an actual or matured liability), 
subordinated or otherwise, (b) have assets with present fair salable value 
not less than the amount that will be required to pay their liability on 
their debts as they become absolute and matured, (c) will be able to pay 
their debts and liabilities, subordinated, contingent or otherwise, as they 
become absolute and matured and (d) are not engaged in business or a 
transaction, and are not about to engage in business or a transaction, for 
which their property would constitute an un-reasonably small capital.
 
All capitalized terms used but not defined in this certificate shall have 
the meanings set forth in the Credit Agreement.
