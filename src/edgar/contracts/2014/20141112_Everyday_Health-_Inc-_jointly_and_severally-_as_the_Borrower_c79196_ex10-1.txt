amount of interest and fees that should have been paid for such period over 
the amount of interest and fees actually paid for such period; and (ii) if

resulted in lower pricing for such period, neither the Administrative Agent

“Assignment and Assumption”: an assignment and assumption entered into by a

the Administrative Agent.
 
“Available Revolving Commitment”: at any time, an amount equal to the Total

reimbursed or converted into Revolving Loans at such time, minus (d) the

Loans to the Borrower on the Original Closing Date in an aggregate original 
principal amount equal to $40,000,000, the aggregate outstanding principal 
balance of which is $39,000,000 as of the Closing Date. The Existing Term 
Loans (together with all accrued and unpaid interest, fees, indemnities, 
costs and other payment obligations that are outstanding immediately prior 
to the date hereof) are owing as of the Closing Date, and are payable 
without set-off, counterclaim, deduction, offset or defense. Subject to the 
terms and conditions hereof, each Term Lender with a Term Commitment 
severally agrees to make a new Term Loan to the Borrower on, or to the 
extent requested by the Borrower, within two (2) Business Days after, the 
Closing Date in an amount equal to the amount of the Term Commitment of 
such Lender, such that after giving effect to the Term Loan to be made on 
or about the Closing Date, the aggregate outstanding principal balance of 
the Term Loans (inclusive of the Existing Term Loans) shall be $60,000,000. 
On and after the making of such Term Loans on or about the Closing Date, 
each Existing Term Loan and the Term Loan made on or about the Closing Date 
shall be made or converted (as applicable) into ABR Loans and shall 
constitute the “Term Loans” hereunder. All breakage fees in connection with 
the conversion of the Existing Term Loans to such ABR Loans shall be 
waived. All accrued and unpaid interest in respect of the Existing Term 
Loans shall be repaid on the Closing Date. The Term Loans may from time to 
time be Eurodollar Loans or ABR Loans, as determined by the Borrower and 
notified to the Administrative Agent in accordance with Sections 2.2 and 
2.13, and once repaid in accordance with the provisions hereof may not be 
reborrowed.
 
2.2 Procedure for Term Loan Borrowing. The Borrower shall give the 
Administrative Agent an irrevocable Notice of Borrowing (which must be 
received by the Administrative Agent prior to 10:00 A.M., Pacific time, one 
(1) Business Day prior to the anticipated Closing Date (with originals to 
follow within three (3) Business Days)) requesting that the Term Lenders 
with a Term Commitment make the Term Loans on the Closing Date (or to the 
extent requested by the Borrower, within two (2) Business Days after, the 
Closing Date) and specifying the amount to be borrowed. The Term Loans made 
on or about the Closing Date shall initially be ABR Loans. Upon receipt of 
such Notice of Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify 
each Term Lender with a Term Commitment thereof. Not later than 12:00 P.M. 
Pacific time, on the requested funding date, each Term Lender with a Term 
Commitment shall make available to the Administrative Agent at the Term 
Loan Funding Office an amount in immediately available funds equal to the 
portion of the Term Loan or Term Loans to be made by such Lender on or 
about the Closing Date. The Administrative Agent shall credit the account 
of the Borrower on the books of such office of the Administrative Agent 
with the aggregate of the amounts made available to the Administrative 
Agent by the Term Lenders in immediately available funds or, if so 
specified in the Flow of Funds Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall 
wire transfer all or a portion of such aggregate amounts, in accordance 
with the wire instructions specified in the Flow of Funds Agreement.
 
2.3 Repayment of Term Loans. Beginning on January 1, 2015, the Term Loans 
shall be repaid in consecutive quarterly installments on the first day of 
each fiscal quarter, each of which installments shall be in an amount equal 
to such Lender’s Term Percentage multiplied by the installment amount set 
forth below opposite such installment payment date:
 
Installment Payment Dates 	  	Installment Amount

if applicable, the initial amount of any Additional Term Loans)

(plus, if applicable, the initial amount of any Additional Term Loans)
The first day of each fiscal quarter thereafter 	  	2.50% of initial 
principal amount of the Term Loan (plus, if applicable, the initial amount 
of any Additional Term Loans)
 
To the extent not previously paid, all then outstanding Term Loans shall be 
due and payable on the Term Loan Maturity Date, together with accrued and 
unpaid interest on the principal amount to be paid to but excluding the 
date of payment.
 
2.4 Revolving Commitments.
 
(a) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, each Revolving Lender 
severally agrees to make revolving credit loans (each, a “Revolving Loan” 
and, collectively, the “Revolving Loans”) to the Borrower from time to time 
during the Revolving Commitment Period in an aggregate principal amount 
with respect to all such Revolving Loans at any one time outstanding which, 
when added to the aggregate outstanding amount of any Revolving Loans, any 
Swingline Loans, the aggregate undrawn amount of all outstanding Letters of 
Credit, and the aggregate amount of all L/C Disbursements that have not yet 
been reimbursed or converted into Revolving Loans, incurred on behalf of 
the Borrower and owing to such Lender, does not exceed the amount of such 
Lender’s Revolving Commitment. In addition, the amount of the Total 
Revolving Extensions of Credit outstanding at such time shall not exceed 
the Total Revolving Commitments in effect at such time. During the 
Revolving Commitment Period the Borrower may use the Revolving Commitments 
by borrowing, prepaying the Revolving Loans in whole or in part, and 
reborrowing, all in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof. The 
Revolving Loans may from time to time be Eurodollar Loans or ABR Loans, as 
determined by the Borrower and notified to the Administrative Agent in 
accordance with Sections 2.5 and 2.13. Notwithstanding anything to the 
contrary contained herein, during the existence of a Default or an Event of 
Default, no Revolving Loan may be borrowed as, converted to or continued as 
a Eurodollar Loan.
 
(b) The Borrower shall repay all outstanding Revolving Loans on the 
Revolving Termination Date.
 
(c) As of the date hereof, the outstanding principal amount of the 
Revolving Loan under the Existing Credit Agreement is $35,000,000 (the “
Existing Revolving Loans”). The Existing Revolving Loans (together with all 
accrued and unpaid interest, fees, indemnities, costs and other payment 
obligations that are outstanding immediately prior to the date hereof) are 
owing as of the Closing Date, and are payable without set-off, 
counterclaim, deduction, offset or defense. On the Closing Date, each 
Existing Revolving Loan shall be made or converted (as applicable) into ABR 
Loans and shall constitute Revolving Loans hereunder. All breakage fees in 
connection with the conversion of the Existing Revolving Loans to ABR Loans 
shall be waived. All accrued and unpaid interest and fees in respect 
thereof shall be repaid on the Closing Date. On the Closing Date, each

36


Revolving Lender that is not an Existing Lender agrees to pay to the 
Administrative Agent (which may take the form of such Lender overfunding 
any Revolving Loans requested on the Closing Date or such other procedure 
reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent), for the account of the 
Revolving Lenders, the amount necessary to ensure that the outstanding 
principal amount of the Revolving Loans and participations hereunder in 
Letters of Credit and participations hereunder in Swingline Loans of each 
Revolving Lender shall equal each Revolving Lender’s respective Revolving 
Percentages and L/C Percentages.
 
2.5 Procedure for Revolving Loan Borrowing. The Borrower may borrow up to 
the Available Revolving Commitment under the Revolving Commitments during 
the Revolving Commitment Period on any Business Day; provided that the 
Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent an irrevocable Notice of 
Borrowing (which must be received by the Administrative Agent prior to 
10:00 A.M., Pacific time, (a) three (3) Business Days prior to the 
requested Borrowing Date, in the case of Eurodollar Loans, or (b) one (1) 
Business Day prior to the requested Borrowing Date, in the case of ABR 
Loans (in each case, with originals to follow within three (3) Business 
Days)) (provided that any such Notice of Borrowing of ABR Loans under the 
Revolving Facility to finance payments under Section 3.5(a) may be given 
not later than 10:00 A.M., Pacific time, on the date of the proposed 
borrowing), in each such case specifying (i) the amount and Type of 
Revolving Loans to be borrowed, (ii) the requested Borrowing Date, (iii) in 
the case of Eurodollar Loans, the respective amounts of each such Type of 
Loan and the respective lengths of the initial Interest Period therefor, 
and (iv) instructions for remittance of the proceeds of the applicable 
Loans to be borrowed. Unless otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent 
in its sole discretion, no Revolving Loan may be made as, converted into or 
continued as a Eurodollar Loan having an Interest Period in excess of one 
month prior to the date that is 30 days after the Closing Date, other than 
any Existing Revolving Loans that are Eurodollar Loans on the Closing Date. 
Each borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of a Eurodollar Loan shall 
be in a principal amount of $1,000,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in 
excess thereof (or, if the then aggregate Available Revolving Commitments 
are less than $1,000,000, such lesser amount). Except as provided in 
Sections 3.5(b) and 2.7(b), each borrowing of or conversion to ABR Loans 
shall be in a principal amount of $500,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 
in excess thereof (or, if the then aggregate Available Revolving 
Commitments are less than $1,000,000, such lesser amount). Upon receipt of 
any such Notice of Borrowing from the Borrower, the Administrative Agent 
shall promptly notify each Revolving Lender thereof. Each Revolving Lender 
will make the amount of its pro rata share of each such borrowing available 
to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Borrower at the 
Revolving Loan Funding Office prior to 12:00 P.M., Pacific time, on the 
Borrowing Date requested by the Borrower in funds immediately available to 
the Administrative Agent. Such borrowing will then be made available to the 
Borrower by the Administrative Agent crediting such account as is 
designated in writing to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower with the 
aggregate of the amounts made available to the Administrative Agent by the 
Revolving Lenders and in like funds as received by the Administrative Agent 
or, if so specified in the Flow of Funds Agreement, the Administrative 
Agent shall wire transfer all or a portion of such aggregate amounts, in 
accordance with the wire instructions specified in the Flow of Funds 
Agreement. No Revolving Loan which constitutes a Eurodollar Loan will be 
made on the Closing Date.
 
2.6 Swingline Commitment. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the 
Swingline Lender agrees to make available a portion of the credit 
accommodations otherwise available to the Borrower under the Revolving 
Commitments from time to time during the Revolving Commitment Period by 
making swing line loans (each a “Swingline Loan” and, collectively, the “
Swingline Loans”) to the Borrower; provided that (a) the aggregate 
principal amount of Swingline Loans outstanding at any time shall not 
exceed the Swingline Commitment then in effect, (b) the Borrower shall not 
request, and the Swingline Lender shall not make, any Swingline Loan if, 
after giving effect to the making of such Swingline Loan, the aggregate 
amount of the Available Revolving Commitments would be less than zero,

37


and (c) the Borrower shall not use the proceeds of any Swingline Loan to 
refinance any then outstanding Swingline Loan. During the Revolving 
Commitment Period, the Borrower may use the Swingline Commitment by 
borrowing, repaying and reborrowing, all in accordance with the terms and 
conditions hereof. Swingline Loans shall be ABR Loans only and shall be 
made only in Dollars. To the extent not otherwise required by the terms 
hereof to be repaid prior thereto, the Borrower shall repay to the 
Swingline Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Swingline Loan on 
the Revolving Termination Date.
 
2.7 Procedure for Swingline Borrowing; Refunding of Swingline Loans.
 
(a) Whenever the Borrower desires that the Swingline Lender make Swingline 
Loans the Borrower shall give the Swingline Lender irrevocable telephonic 
or electronic notice (which notice must be received by the Swingline Lender 
not later than 12:00 P.M., Pacific time, on the proposed Borrowing Date) 
confirmed promptly in writing by a Notice of Borrowing, specifying (i) the 
amount to be borrowed, (ii) the requested Borrowing Date (which shall be a 
Business Day during the Revolving Commitment Period), and (iii) 
instructions for the remittance of the proceeds of such Loan. Each 
borrowing under the Swingline Commitment shall be in an amount equal to 
$500,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof. Promptly 
thereafter, on the Borrowing Date specified in a notice in respect of 
Swingline Loans, the Swingline Lender shall make available to the Borrower 
an amount in immediately available funds equal to the amount of the 
Swingline Loan to be made by depositing such amount in the account 
designated in writing to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower. Unless a 
Swingline Loan is sooner refinanced by the advance of a Revolving Loan 
pursuant to Section 2.7(b), such Swingline Loan shall be repaid by the 
Borrower no later than five (5) Business Days after the advance of such 
Swingline Loan.
 
(b) The Swingline Lender, at any time and from time to time in its sole and 
absolute discretion, may, on behalf of the Borrower (which hereby 
irrevocably directs the Swingline Lender to act on its behalf), on one (1) 
Business Day’s telephonic notice given by the Swingline Lender no later 
than 12:00 P.M., Pacific time, and promptly confirmed in writing, request 
each Revolving Lender to make, and each Revolving Lender hereby agrees to 
make, a Revolving Loan, in an amount equal to such Revolving Lender’s 
Revolving Percentage of the aggregate amount of such Swingline Loan (each a 
“Refunded Swingline Loan”) outstanding on the date of such notice, to repay 
the Swingline Lender. Each Revolving Lender shall make the amount of such 
Revolving Loan available to the Administrative Agent at the Revolving Loan 
Funding Office in immediately available funds, not later than 10:00 A.M., 
Pacific time, one (1) Business Day after the date of such notice. The 
proceeds of such Revolving Loan shall immediately be made available by the 
Administrative Agent to the Swingline Lender for application by the 
Swingline Lender to the repayment of the Refunded Swingline Loan. The 
Borrower irrevocably authorizes the Swingline Lender to charge the 
Borrower’s accounts with the Administrative Agent (up to the amount 
available in each such account) immediately to pay the amount of any 
Refunded Swingline Loan to the extent amounts received from the Revolving 
Lenders are not sufficient to repay in full such Refunded Swingline Loan.
 
(c) If prior to the time that the Borrower has repaid the Swingline Loans 
pursuant to Section 2.7(a) or a Revolving Loan has been made pursuant to 
Section 2.7(b), one of the events described in Section 8.1(f) shall have 
occurred or if for any other reason, as determined by the Swingline Lender 
in its sole discretion, Revolving Loans may not be made as contemplated by 
Section 2.7(b), each Revolving Lender shall, on the date such Revolving 
Loan was to have been made pursuant to the notice referred to in Section 
2.7(b) or on the date requested by the Swingline Lender (with at least one 
(1) Business Days’ notice to the Revolving Lenders), purchase for cash an 
undivided participating interest in the then outstanding Swingline Loans by 
paying to the Swingline Lender an amount (the “Swingline Participation 
Amount”) equal to (i) such Revolving Lender’s Revolving

38


Percentage times (ii) the sum of the aggregate principal amount of the 
outstanding Swingline Loans that were to have been repaid with such 
Revolving Loans.
 
(d) Whenever, at any time after the Swingline Lender has received from any 
Revolving Lender such Lender’s Swingline Participation Amount, the 
Swingline Lender receives any payment on account of the Swingline Loans, 
the Swingline Lender will distribute to such Lender its Swingline 
Participation Amount (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest 
payments, to reflect the period of time during which such Lender’s 
participating interest was outstanding and funded and, in the case of 
principal and interest payments, to reflect such Lender’s pro rata portion 
of such payment if such payment is not sufficient to pay the principal of 
and interest on all Swingline Loans then due); provided that in the event 
that such payment received by the Swingline Lender is required to be 
returned, such Revolving Lender will return to the Swingline Lender any 
portion thereof previously distributed to it by the Swingline Lender.
 
(e) Each Revolving Lender’s obligation to make the Loans referred to in 
Section 2.7(b) and to purchase participating interests pursuant to Section 
2.7(c) shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any 
circumstance, including (i) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense 
or other right that such Revolving Lender or the Borrower may have against 
the Swingline Lender, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason 
whatsoever, (ii) the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default or the 
failure to satisfy any of the other conditions specified in Section 5, 
(iii) any adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise) of the 
Borrower, (iv) any breach of this Agreement or any other Loan Document by 
the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other Revolving Lender, or (v) 
any other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not 
similar to any of the foregoing.
 
(f) The Swingline Lender may resign at any time by giving 30 days’ prior 
notice to the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Borrower. After the 
resignation of the Swingline Lender hereunder, the retiring Swingline 
Lender shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the 
rights and obligations of the Swingline Lender under this Agreement and the 
other Loan Documents with respect to Swingline Loans made by it prior to 
such resignation, but shall not be required to make any additional 
Swingline Loans.
 
2.8 Incremental Facility.
 
(a) At any time from the Closing Date until the Term Loan Maturity Date, 
the Borrower may request (but subject to the conditions set forth below) 
(x) to have new Term Loans made available (the “Additional Term Loans”), in 
an aggregate principal amount for all Additional Term Loans not to exceed 
$40,000,000 minus the amount of any Revolver Increases (any such Additional 
Term Loan, the “Term Loan Increase”) or (y) the Revolving Commitment be 
increased by an amount not to exceed the Available Revolving Increase 
Amount (each such increase of the Revolving Commitment, a “Revolver 
Increase” and together with the Term Loan Increase, each, an “Increase”). 
No Lender shall be obligated to participate in any Increase, and each 
Lender’s determination to participate in any such Increase shall be in such 
Lender’s sole and absolute discretion. The Administrative Agent shall 
invite each Lender to provide an Additional Term Loan or Revolver Increase 
(it being understood that no Lender shall be obligated to provide an 
Increase) in connection with any proposed Increase and to the extent, ten 
(10) Business Days after receipt of invitation, sufficient Lenders do not 
agree to provide an Increase in connection with such proposed Increase on 
terms acceptable to the Borrower, then the Administrative Agent may invite 
any prospective lender that satisfies the criteria of being an “Eligible 
Assignee” and is reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower (it being agreed 
that any prospective lender that is (x) a Lender or Affiliate of a Lender 
or (y) an Approved Fund shall be reasonably satisfactory) to become a 
Lender in connection with the proposed Increase.

39


Any Increase shall be in the amount of at least $5,000,000 (or such lower 
amount that represents all remaining availability pursuant to this Section 
2.24) and integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess thereof (or such lower 
amount that represents all remaining availability pursuant to this Section 
2.24). Additionally, for the avoidance of doubt, it is understood and 
agreed that in no event shall the aggregate amount of the Increases exceed 
$40,000,000 during the term of the Agreement.
 
(b) Each of the following shall be conditions precedent to the 
effectiveness of any Increase:
 
(i) (A) any Additional Term Loans shall, for purposes of principal 
repayment and interest, be treated substantially the same as the Term Loans 
funded on or about the Closing Date, and shall be on the same terms 
(including the pricing, and maturity date), as applicable, as, and pursuant 
to documentation applicable to, the original Term Facility and (B) any 
Revolver Increase shall be on the same terms (including the pricing, and 
maturity date), as applicable, as, and pursuant to documentation applicable 
to, the original Revolving Facility;
 
(ii) the Borrower shall have delivered an irrevocable written request for 
such Increase at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the requested 
funding date of such Increase;
 
(iii) the Administrative Agent shall have obtained the commitment of one or 
more Lenders (or other prospective Lenders that satisfy the criteria of 
being an “Eligible Assignee”; provided that no such Lender shall be a Loan 
Party or any of a Loan Party’s Affiliates or Subsidiaries) reasonably 
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower (unless such 
prospective Lender is (x) a Lender or Affiliate of a Lender or (y) an 
Approved Fund) to provide the applicable Increase and any prospective 
Lender(s), the Loan Parties and the Administrative Agent have signed a 
joinder agreement to this Agreement (an “Increase Joinder”), in form and 
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, pursuant to 
which such prospective Lender(s), the Loan Parties, and the Administrative 
Agent are party (any Increase Joinder may, with the consent of the 
Administrative Agent, the Borrower and the Lenders or prospective Lender(s) 
agreeing to the proposed Increase, effect such amendments to this Agreement 
and the other Loan Documents as may be necessary or appropriate to 
effectuate the provisions of this Section 2.8 (including, if applicable, 
any amendment necessary to ensure and demonstrate that the Liens and 
security interests granted by the Loan Documents are perfected under the 
UCC to secure the Obligations in respect of the Additional Term Loans of 
Revolver Increase, as applicable)). Notwithstanding anything to the 
contrary in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document, an Increase 
Joinder reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, and the 
amendments to this Agreement effected thereby, shall not require the 
consent of any Lender other than the Lender(s) agreeing to fund such 
Increase;
 
(iv) the Borrower shall have executed any Notes requested by any Lender in 
connection with the making of the Increase;
 
(v) each of the conditions precedent set forth in Section 5.2 shall be 
satisfied;
 
(vi) the Borrower shall have delivered to the Administrative Agent an 
updated pro forma Compliance Certificate (after giving effect to the 
Increase) for Borrower and its Subsidiaries evidencing compliance on a pro 
forma basis with then applicable financial covenants set forth in Section 
7.1 hereof as of the end of the most recently ended fiscal quarter together 
with all reasonably detailed calculations demonstrating such compliance;

40


(vii) in connection with such Increase, the Borrower shall pay to 
Administrative Agent all fees required to be paid pursuant to the terms of 
the Fee Letter;
 
(viii) upon the effectiveness of any Increase, unless otherwise 
specifically provided herein, as applicable, (i) (A) all references in this 
Agreement and any other Loan Document to the Term Loans shall be deemed, 
unless the context otherwise requires, to include each Additional Term 
Loans advanced pursuant to this Section 2.8 and (B) all references in this 
Agreement and any other Loan Document to the Term Commitments shall be 
deemed, unless the context otherwise requires, to include the commitment to 
advance an amount equal to the Additional Term Loans advanced pursuant to 
this Section 2.8, and/or (ii) (A) all references in this Agreement and any 
other Loan Document to the Revolving Loans shall be deemed, unless the 
context otherwise requires, to include such Revolver Increase advanced 
pursuant to this Section 2.8 and (ii) all references in this Agreement and 
any other Loan Document to the Revolving Commitment shall be deemed, unless 
the context otherwise requires, to include the commitment to advance an 
amount equal to such Revolver Increase pursuant to this Section 2.8; and
 
(ix) the Revolving Loans and Revolving Commitments established pursuant to 
this Section 2.8 shall constitute Revolving Loans and Revolving Commitments 
under, and shall be entitled to all the benefits afforded by, this 
Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and shall, without limiting the 
foregoing, benefit equally and ratably from any guarantees and the security 
interests created by the Loan Documents.
 
The Additional Term Loans and Term Commitments established pursuant to this 
Section 2.8 shall constitute Term Loans and Term Commitments under, and 
shall rank pari passu in right of payment in respect of the Collateral and 
with the Obligations in respect of the Term Loans. The Borrower shall take 
any actions reasonably required by Administrative Agent to ensure and 
demonstrate that the Liens and security interests granted by the Loan 
Documents continue to be perfected under the Code or otherwise after giving 
effect to the establishment of any Increase.
 
2.9 Fees.
 
(a) Upfront Fee. On or prior to the Closing Date, the Borrower agrees to 
pay to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of itself and the other 
Lenders, an upfront fee in the amount specified in the Fee Letter.
 
(b) Commitment Fee. As additional compensation for the Total Revolving 
Commitments, the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the 
account of the Lenders, a fee for the Borrower’s non-use of available funds 
under the Revolving Facility (the “Commitment Fee”), payable quarterly in 
arrears on the first day of each calendar quarter occurring prior to the 
Revolving Termination Date, and on the Revolving Termination Date, in an 
amount equal to the Commitment Fee Rate multiplied by the average unused 
portion of the Total Revolving Commitments, as reasonably determined by the 
Administrative Agent. The unused portion of the Total Revolving 
Commitments, for purposes of this calculation, shall equal the difference 
between (i) the Total Revolving Commitments (as reduced from time to time), 
and (ii) the sum of (A) the average for the period of the daily closing 
balance of the Revolving Loans outstanding, (B) the aggregate undrawn 
amount of all Letters of Credit outstanding at such time, and (C) the 
aggregate amount of all L/C Disbursements that have not yet been reimbursed 
or converted into Revolving Loans at such time. For the avoidance of doubt, 
the outstanding amount of any Swingline Loans shall not be counted towards 
or considered usage of the Total Revolving Commitments for purposes of 
determining the Commitment Fee.

41


(c) Agency and Arrangement Fees. The Borrower agrees to pay to the 
Administrative Agent the fees in the amounts and on the dates as set forth 
in the Fee Letter and to perform any other obligations contained therein.
 
(d) [Reserved].
 
(e) Fees Nonrefundable. All fees payable under this Section 2.9 shall be 
fully earned on the date paid and nonrefundable.
 
(f) Increase in Fees. At any time that an Event of Default exists, upon the 
request of the Required Lenders, the amount of any of the foregoing fees 
due under subsection (b) shall be increased by adding 2.00% per annum 
thereto; provided that such fees shall automatically increase without any 
Required Lender consent upon the occurrence of any Event of Default arising 
under Section 8.1(a).
 
2.10 Termination or Reduction of Total Revolving Commitments; Total L/C 
Commitments.
 
(a) Termination or Reduction of Total Revolving Commitments. The Borrower 
shall have the right, upon not less than three (3) Business Days’ written 
notice delivered to the Administrative Agent, to terminate the Total 
Revolving Commitments or, from time to time, to reduce the amount of the 
Total Revolving Commitments; provided that no such termination or reduction 
shall be permitted if, after giving effect thereto and to any prepayments 
of the Revolving Loans and Swingline Loans to be made on the effective date 
thereof the amount of the Total Revolving Extensions of Credit then 
outstanding would exceed the Total Revolving Commitments then in effect. 
Any such reduction shall be in an amount equal to $1,000,000, or a whole 
multiple in excess thereof (or, if the then Total Revolving Commitments are 
less than $1,000,000, such lesser amount), and shall reduce permanently the 
Total Revolving Commitments then in effect; provided that, if in connection 
with any such reduction or termination of the Total Revolving Commitments a 
Eurodollar Loan is prepaid on any day other than the last day of the 
Interest Period applicable thereto, the Borrower shall also pay any amounts 
owing pursuant to Section 2.21. Any reduction of the Total Revolving 
Commitments shall be applied to the Revolving Commitments of each Lender 
according to its respective Revolving Percentage. All fees accrued until 
the effective date of any termination of the Total Revolving Commitments 
shall be paid on the effective date of such termination.
 
(b) Termination or Reduction of Total L/C Commitments. The Borrower shall 
have the right, upon not less than three (3) Business Days’ written notice 
delivered to the Administrative Agent, to terminate the Total L/C 
Commitments available to the Borrower or, from time to time, to reduce the 
amount of the Total L/C Commitments available to the Borrower; provided 
that, in any such case, no such termination or reduction of the Total L/C 
Commitments shall be permitted if, after giving effect thereto, the Total 
L/C Commitments shall be reduced to an amount that would result in the 
aggregate L/C Exposure exceeding the Total L/C Commitments (as so reduced). 
Any such reduction shall be in an amount equal to $1,000,000, or a whole 
multiple in excess thereof (or, if the then Total L/C Commitments are less 
than $1,000,000, such lesser amount), and shall reduce permanently the 
Total L/C Commitments then in effect. Any reduction of the Total L/C 
Commitments shall be applied to the L/C Commitments of each Lender 
according to its respective L/C Percentage. All fees accrued until the 
effective date of any termination of the Total L/C Commitments shall be 
paid on the effective date of such termination.

42


2.11 Optional Loan Prepayments.
 
The Borrower may at any time and from time to time prepay the Loans, in 
whole or in part, without premium or penalty, upon irrevocable notice 
delivered to the Administrative Agent no later than 10:00 A.M., Pacific 
time, three (3) Business Days prior thereto, in the case of Eurodollar 
Loans, and no later than 10:00 A.M., Pacific time, one (1) Business Day 
prior thereto, in the case of ABR Loans, which notice shall specify the 
date and amount of the proposed prepayment; provided that if a Eurodollar 
Loan is prepaid on any day other than the last day of the Interest Period 
applicable thereto, the Borrower shall also pay any amounts owing pursuant 
to Section 2.21; provided further that if such notice of prepayment 
indicates that such prepayment is to be funded with the proceeds of a 
refinancing, such notice of prepayment may be revoked if the financing is 
not consummated. Upon receipt of any such notice the Administrative Agent 
shall promptly notify each relevant Lender thereof. If any such notice is 
given, the amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the 
date specified therein, together with (except in the case of Revolving 
Loans that are ABR Loans and Swingline Loans) accrued interest to such date 
on the amount prepaid. Partial prepayments of Term Loans and Revolving 
Loans shall be in an aggregate principal amount of $1,000,000 or a whole 
multiple thereof. Partial prepayments of Swingline Loans shall be in an 
aggregate principal amount of $100,000 or a whole multiple thereof.
 
2.12 Mandatory Prepayments. Without duplication:
 
(a) If any Capital Stock shall be issued by the Borrower or any of its 
Subsidiaries (excluding Capital Stock issued to a Loan Party), an amount 
equal to 50% of the Net Cash Proceeds thereof shall be applied on the date 
of such issuance toward the prepayment of the Term Loans and other amounts 
as set forth in Section 2.12(e). Notwithstanding the foregoing, any 
proceeds from the any public follow-on offering of the Borrower’s Capital 
Stock or any proceeds from the exercise of stock options or warrants shall 
not be required to be applied to prepay the Obligations pursuant to this 
Section 2.12(a).
 
(b) If any Indebtedness shall be incurred by any Group Member (excluding 
any Indebtedness incurred in accordance with Section 7.2), an amount equal 
to 100% of the Net Cash Proceeds thereof shall be applied on the date of 
such incurrence toward the prepayment of the Term Loans and other amounts 
as set forth in Section 2.12(e).
 
(c) If on any date any Group Member shall receive Net Cash Proceeds from 
any Asset Sale or Recovery Event then, unless a Reinvestment Notice shall 
be delivered in respect thereof, such Net Cash Proceeds shall be applied on 
such date toward the prepayment of the Loans and other amounts as set forth 
in Section 2.12(e); provided that notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the 
aggregate Net Cash Proceeds of Asset Sales and Recovery Events that may be 
excluded from the foregoing requirement pursuant to a Reinvestment Notice 
shall not exceed $500,000 in any fiscal year of the Borrower and (ii) on 
each Reinvestment Prepayment Date, an amount equal to the Reinvestment 
Prepayment Amount with respect to the relevant Reinvestment Event shall be 
applied toward the prepayment of the Loans and other amounts as set forth 
in Section 2.12(e).
 
(d) If, for any fiscal year of the Borrower (commencing with the Borrower’s 
fiscal year ending December 31, 2015), there shall be Excess Cash Flow, the 
Borrower shall, on the relevant Excess Cash Flow Application Date, apply 
50% of such Excess Cash Flow (minus voluntary principal repayments of the 
Loans under the Loan Documents (excluding voluntary repayment of Revolving 
Loans or Swingline Loans, except to the extent there is an equivalent 
permanent reduction in the commitments related thereto), except to the 
extent such repayments are not made with internally generated funds for 
such fiscal year) toward the prepayment of the Term Loans and other amounts 
as set forth in Section 2.12(e); provided that such percentage shall be 
reduced to (i) 25% if the

43


Consolidated Leverage Ratio as of the last day of such fiscal year is less 
than 2.50 to 1.00 but equal to or greater than 1.00 to 1.00 and (ii) 0% if 
the Consolidated Leverage Ratio as of the last day of such fiscal year is 
less than 1.00 to 1.00. Each such prepayment shall be made on a date (each 
an “Excess Cash Flow Application Date”) occurring no later than the 
earliest of five Business Days following (i) the date on which the 
financial statements of the Borrower referred to in Section 6.1(a), for the 
fiscal year with respect to which such prepayment is made, are required to 
be delivered to the Lenders, (ii) the date such financial statements are 
actually delivered. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent 
applicable, any proceeds from any public follow-on offering of EDH’s 
Capital Stock or any proceeds from the exercise of stock options or 
warrants shall not be considered in the calculation of Excess Cash Flow or 
any component thereof for purposes of this Section 2.12(d).
 
(e) Amounts to be applied in connection with prepayments made pursuant to 
this Section 2.12 shall be applied to the prepayment of installments due in 
respect of the Term Loans in reverse order of maturity and in accordance 
with Sections 2.3 and 2.18(b) (provided that any Term Lender may decline 
any such prepayment (the aggregate amount of all such prepayments declined 
in connection with any particular prepayment, collectively, the “Declined 
Amount”), in which case the Declined Amount shall be distributed first, to 
the prepayment, on a pro rata basis, of the Term Loans held by Term Lenders 
that have elected to accept such Declined Amounts; second, to the extent of 
any residual, if no Term Loans remain outstanding, to the prepayment of the 
Revolving Loans in accordance with Section 2.15(c) (with no corresponding 
permanent reduction in the Revolving Commitments); and third, to the extent 
of any residual, if no Term Loans or Revolving Loans remain outstanding, to 
the replacement of outstanding Letters of Credit and/or the deposit of an 
amount in cash (in an amount not to exceed 105% of the then existing L/C 
Exposure) in a Cash Collateral account established with the Administrative 
Agent for the benefit of the Issuing Lender and the L/C Lenders on terms 
and conditions satisfactory to the Issuing Lender. Each prepayment of the 
Loans under this Section 2.12 (except in the case of Revolving Loans that 
are ABR Loans and Swingline Loans, in the event the Revolving Commitments 
have not been terminated) shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the 
date of such prepayment on the amount prepaid. The Borrower shall deliver 
to the Administrative Agent and each Term Lender notice of each prepayment 
of Term Loans in whole or in part pursuant to this Section 2.12 not less 
than five (5) Business Days prior to the date such prepayment shall be made 
(each, a “Mandatory Prepayment Date”). Such notice shall set forth (i) the 
Mandatory Prepayment Date, (ii) the aggregate amount of such prepayment and 
(iii) the options of each Term Lender to (x) decline or accept its share of 
such prepayment and (y) to accept Declined Amounts. Any Term Lender that 
wishes to exercise its option to decline such prepayment or to accept 
Declined Amounts shall notify the Administrative Agent by facsimile not 
later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Mandatory Prepayment Date.
 
(f) The Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent, at the time of 
each prepayment required under this Section 2.12, (i) a certificate signed 
by a Responsible Officer setting forth in reasonable detail the calculation 
of the amount of such prepayment or reduction and (ii) to the extent 
practicable, at least ten days prior written notice of such prepayment or 
reduction (and the Administrative Agent shall promptly provide the same to 
each Lender). Each notice of prepayment shall specify the prepayment or 
reduction date, the Type of each Loan being prepaid and the principal 
amount of each Loan (or portion thereof) to be prepaid.
 
(g) No prepayment fee shall be payable in respect of any mandatory 
prepayments made pursuant to this Section 2.12.
 
(h) Amounts to be applied pursuant to this Section 2.12 to the prepayment 
of Term Loans and Revolving Loans shall be applied, as applicable, first to 
reduce outstanding ABR Loans. Any amounts remaining after each such 
application shall be applied to prepay Eurodollar Loans.

44


Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the amount of any prepayment of Loans 
required under this Section 2.12 shall be in excess of the amount of the 
ABR Loans at the time outstanding (an “Excess Amount”), only the portion of 
the amount of such prepayment as is equal to the amount of such outstanding 
ABR Loans shall be immediately prepaid and, at the election of Borrower, 
the Excess Amount shall be either (A) deposited in an escrow account on 
terms reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and applied to 
the prepayment of Eurodollar Loans on the last day of the then 
next-expiring Interest Period for Eurodollar Loans; provided that (i) 
interest in respect of such Excess Amount shall continue to accrue thereon 
at the rate provided hereunder for the Loans which such Excess Amount is 
intended to repay until such Excess Amount shall have been used in full to 
repay such Loans and (ii) at any time while an Event of Default has 
occurred and is continuing, the Administrative Agent may, and upon written 
direction from the Required Lenders shall, apply any or all proceeds then 
on deposit to the payment of such Loans in an amount equal to such Excess 
Amount or (B) prepaid immediately, together with any breakage costs owing 
to the Lenders pursuant to Section 2.21.
 
2.13 Conversion and Continuation Options.
 
(a) The Borrower may elect from time to time to convert Eurodollar Loans to 
ABR Loans by giving the Administrative Agent prior irrevocable notice in a 
Notice of Conversion/Continuation of such election no later than 10:00 
A.M., Pacific time, on the Business Day preceding the proposed conversion 
date; provided that any such conversion of Eurodollar Loans may only be 
made on the last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto. Subject to 
Section 2.17, the Borrower may elect from time to time to convert ABR Loans 
to Eurodollar Loans by giving the Administrative Agent prior irrevocable 
notice in a Notice of Conversion/Continuation of such election no later 
than 10:00 A.M., Pacific time, on the third Business Day preceding the 
proposed conversion date (which notice shall specify the length of the 
initial Interest Period therefor); provided that no ABR Loan may be 
converted into a Eurodollar Loan when any Event of Default has occurred and 
is continuing. Upon receipt of any such notice, the Administrative Agent 
shall promptly notify each relevant Lender thereof.
 
(b) Subject to Section 2.17, any Eurodollar Loan may be continued as such 
upon the expiration of the then current Interest Period with respect 
thereto by the Borrower giving irrevocable notice in a Notice of 
Conversion/Continuation to the Administrative Agent by no later than 10:00 
A.M., Pacific time, on the date occurring three Business Days preceding the 
proposed continuation date and otherwise in accordance with the applicable 
provisions of the term “Interest Period” set forth in Section 1.1, of the 
length of the next Interest Period to be applicable to such Loans; 
provided that no Eurodollar Loan may be continued as such when any Event of 
Default has occurred and is continuing; provided further that (i) if the 
Borrower shall fail to give any required notice as described above in this 
paragraph, such Loans shall automatically be continued as Eurodollar Loans 
with a one month Interest Period on the last day of such then expiring 
Interest Period, and (ii) if such continuation is not permitted pursuant to 
the preceding proviso, such Loans shall automatically be converted to ABR 
Loans on the last day of such then expiring Interest Period. Upon receipt 
of any such notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each 
relevant Lender thereof.
 
2.14 Limitations on Eurodollar Tranches. Notwithstanding anything to the 
contrary in this Agreement, all borrowings, conversions and continuations 
of Eurodollar Loans and all selections of Interest Periods shall be in such 
amounts and be made pursuant to such elections so that, (a) after giving 
effect thereto, the aggregate principal amount of the Eurodollar Loans 
comprising each Eurodollar Tranche shall be equal to $1,000,000 or a whole 
multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof, and (b) no more than seven (7) 
Eurodollar Tranches shall be outstanding at any one time.

45


2.15 Interest Rates and Payment Dates.
 
(a) Each Eurodollar Loan shall bear interest for each day during each 
Interest Period with respect thereto at a rate per annum equal to (i) the 
Eurodollar Rate determined for such day plus (ii) the Applicable Margin.
 
(b) Each ABR Loan (including any Swingline Loan) shall bear interest at a 
rate per annum equal to (i) the ABR plus (ii) the Applicable Margin.
 
(c) During the continuance of an Event of Default, at the request of the 
Required Lenders, all outstanding Loans shall bear interest at a rate per 
annum equal to the rate that would otherwise be applicable thereto pursuant 
to the foregoing provisions of this Section plus 2.00% (the “Default Rate
”); provided that the Default Rate shall apply to all outstanding Loans 
automatically and without any Required Lender consent therefor upon the 
occurrence of any Event of Default arising under Section 8.1(a).
 
(d) Interest on the outstanding principal amount of each Loan shall be 
payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date; provided that interest 
accruing pursuant to Section 2.15(c) shall be payable from time to time on 
demand. All accrued and unpaid interest under the Existing Credit Agreement 
on the Closing Date shall be paid on the Closing Date for the benefit of 
the Existing Lenders thereunder.
 
2.16 Computation of Interest and Fees.
 
(a) Interest and fees payable pursuant hereto shall be calculated on the 
basis of a 360-day year for the actual days elapsed, except that, with 
respect to ABR Loans the rate of interest on which is calculated on the 
basis of the Prime Rate, the interest thereon shall be calculated on the 
basis of a 365- (or 366-, as the case may be) day year for the actual days 
elapsed. The Administrative Agent shall as soon as practicable notify the 
Borrower and the relevant Lenders of each determination of a Eurodollar 
Rate. Any change in the interest rate on a Loan resulting from a change in 
the ABR or the Eurocurrency Reserve Requirements shall become effective as 
of the opening of business on the day on which such change becomes 
effective. The Administrative Agent shall as soon as practicable notify the 
Borrower and the relevant Lenders of the effective date and the amount of 
each such change in interest rate.
 
(b) Each determination of an interest rate by the Administrative Agent 
pursuant to any provision of this Agreement shall be conclusive and binding 
on the Borrower and the Lenders in the absence of manifest error. The 
Administrative Agent shall, at the request of the Borrower, deliver to the 
Borrower a statement showing the quotations used by the Administrative 
Agent in determining any interest rate pursuant to Section 2.16(a).
 
2.17 Inability to Determine Interest Rate. If prior to the first day of any 
Interest Period, the Administrative Agent shall have determined (which 
determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Borrower) in 
connection with any request for a Eurodollar Loan or a conversion to or a 
continuation thereof that, by reason of circumstances affecting the 
relevant market, (a) Dollar deposits are not being offered to banks in the 
London interbank market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of 
such requested Loan or conversion or continuation, as applicable, (b) 
adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Eurodollar 
Rate for such Interest Period, or (c) the Eurodollar Rate determined or to 
be determined for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly 
reflect the cost to such Lenders (as conclusively certified by such 
Lenders) of making or maintaining their affected Loans during such Interest 
Period, then, in any such case (a), (b) or (c), the Administrative Agent 
shall promptly notify the

46


Borrower and the relevant Lenders thereof as soon as practicable 
thereafter. Any such determination shall specify the basis for such 
determination and shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive 
and binding for all purposes. Thereafter, (x) any Eurodollar Loans under 
the relevant Facility requested to be made on the first day of such 
Interest Period shall be made as ABR Loans, (y) any Loans under the 
relevant Facility that were to have been converted on the first day of such 
Interest Period to Eurodollar Loans shall be continued as ABR Loans and (z) 
any outstanding Eurodollar Loans under the relevant Facility shall be 
converted, on the last day of the then-current Interest Period, to ABR 
Loans. Until such notice has been withdrawn by the Administrative Agent, no 
further Eurodollar Loans under the relevant Facility shall be made or 
continued as such, nor shall the Borrower have the right to convert Loans 
under the relevant Facility to Eurodollar Loans.
 
2.18 Pro Rata Treatment and Payments.
 
(a) Each borrowing by the Borrower from the Lenders hereunder, each payment 
by the Borrower on account of any commitment fee and any reduction of the 
Commitments shall be made pro rata according to the respective Term 
Percentages, L/C Percentages or Revolving Percentages, as the case may be, 
of the relevant Lenders; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, each 
borrowing of Additional Term Loans shall be made pro rata according to the 
respective commitments of the Lenders providing such Additional Term Loans.
 
(b) Except as otherwise provided herein, each payment (including each 
prepayment) by the Borrower on account of principal of and interest on the 
Term Loans shall be made pro rata according to the respective outstanding 
principal amounts of the Term Loans then held by the Term Lenders. The 
amount of each principal prepayment of the Term Loans (whether optional or 
mandatory) shall be applied to reduce the then remaining installments of 
the Term Loans pro rata based upon the respective then remaining principal 
amounts thereof. Except as otherwise may be agreed by the Borrower and the 
Required Lenders, any prepayment of Loans shall be applied to the then 
outstanding Term Loans on a pro rata basis regardless of type. Amounts 
prepaid on account of the Term Loans may not be reborrowed.
 
(c) Each payment (including each prepayment) by the Borrower on account of 
principal of and interest on the Revolving Loans shall be made pro rata 
according to the respective outstanding principal amounts of the Revolving 
Loans then held by the Revolving Lenders.
 
(d) All payments (including prepayments) to be made by the Borrower 
hereunder, whether on account of principal, interest, fees or otherwise, 
shall be made without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, 
recoupment or setoff and shall be made prior to 10:00 A.M., Pacific time, 
on the due date thereof to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the 
Lenders, at the applicable Funding Office, in Dollars and in immediately 
available funds. The Administrative Agent shall distribute such payments to 
the Lenders promptly upon receipt in like funds as received. Any payment 
received by the Administrative Agent after 10:00 A.M. shall be deemed 
received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or 
fee shall continue to accrue. If any payment hereunder (other than payments 
on the Eurodollar Loans) becomes due and payable on a day other than a 
Business Day, such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding 
Business Day. If any payment on a Eurodollar Loan becomes due and payable 
on a day other than a Business Day, the maturity thereof shall be extended 
to the next succeeding Business Day unless the result of such extension 
would be to extend such payment into another calendar month, in which event 
such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day. In 
the case of any extension of any payment of principal pursuant to the 
preceding two sentences, interest thereon shall be payable at the then 
applicable rate during such extension.

47


(e) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by 
any Lender prior to the date of any borrowing that such Lender will not 
make the amount that would constitute its share of such borrowing available 
to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that such 
Lender is making such amount available to the Administrative Agent on such 
date in accordance with Section 2, and the Administrative Agent may, in 
reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a 
corresponding amount. If such amount is not in fact made available to the 
Administrative Agent by the required time on the Borrowing Date therefor, 
such Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative 
Agent, on demand, such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each 
day from and including the date on which such amount is made available to 
the Borrower but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, 
at (i) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, a rate equal to 
the greater of (A) the Federal Funds Effective Rate and (B) a rate 
determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry 
rules on interbank compensation, and (ii) in the case of a payment to be 
made by the Borrower, the rate per annum applicable to ABR Loans under the 
relevant Facility. If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest 
to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the 
Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of 
such interest paid by the Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its 
share of the applicable borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the 
amount so paid shall constitute such Lender’s Loan included in such 
borrowing. Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any 
claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make 
such payment to the Administrative Agent.
 
(f) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the 
Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the 
Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the Issuing Lender 
hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative 
Agent may assume that the Borrower is making such payment on such date in 
accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute 
to the Lenders or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, the amount due. 
In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each 
of the Lenders or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, severally agrees 
to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so 
distributed to such Lender or Issuing Lender, with interest thereon, for 
each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to 
but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the 
greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the 
Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank 
compensation. Nothing herein shall be deemed to limit the rights of 
Administrative Agent or any Lender against any Loan Party.
 
(g) If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for any 
Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of 
this Section 2, and such funds are not made available to the Borrower by 
the Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable extension 
of credit set forth in Section 5.1 or Section 5.2 are not satisfied or 
waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall 
return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such 
Lender, without interest.
 
(h) The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to (i) make Term Loans, (ii) 
make Revolving Loans, (iii) to fund its participations in L/C Disbursements 
in accordance with its respective L/C Percentage, (iv) to fund its 
respective Swingline Participation Amount of any Swingline Loan, and (v) to 
make payments pursuant to Section 9.7, as applicable, are several and not 
joint. The failure of any Lender to make any such Loan, to fund any such 
participation or to make any such payment under Section 9.7 on any date 
required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding 
obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for 
the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan, to purchase its 
participation or to make its payment under Section 9.7.

48


(i) Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the 
funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a 
representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds 
for any Loan in any particular place or manner.
 
(j) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the 
Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, interest and 
fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, toward 
payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties 
entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then 
due to such parties, and (ii) second, toward payment of principal then due 
hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with 
the amounts of principal then due to such parties.
 
(k) If any Lender shall obtain any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, 
through the exercise of any right of set-off, or otherwise) on account of 
the principal of or interest on any Loan made by it, its participation in 
the L/C Exposure or other obligations hereunder, as applicable (other than 
pursuant to a provision hereof providing for non-pro rata treatment), in 
excess of its Term Percentage, Revolving Percentage or L/C Percentage, as 
applicable, of such payment on account of the Loans or participations 
obtained by all of the Lenders, such Lender shall forthwith advise the 
Administrative Agent of the receipt of such payment, and within five (5) 
Business Days of such receipt purchase (for cash at face value) from the 
other Term Lenders, Revolving Lenders or L/C Lenders, as applicable 
(through the Administrative Agent), without recourse, such participations 
in the Term Loans or Revolving Loans made by them and/or participations in 
the L/C Exposure held by them, as applicable, or make such other 
adjustments as shall be equitable, as shall be necessary to cause such 
purchasing Lender to share the excess payment ratably with each of the 
other Lenders in accordance with their respective Term Percentages, 
Revolving Percentages or L/C Percentages, as applicable; provided, however
, that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered 
by or on behalf of the Borrower from such purchasing Lender, the purchase 
shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such 
recovery, but without interest. The Borrower agrees that any Lender so 
purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to this Section 
2.18(k) may exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of 
set-off) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were 
the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation. No 
documentation other than notices and the like referred to in this Section 
2.18(k) shall be required to implement the terms of this Section 2.18(k). 
The Administrative Agent shall keep records (which shall be conclusive and 
binding in the absence of manifest error) of participations purchased 
pursuant to this Section 2.18(k) and shall in each case notify the Term 
Lenders, the Revolving Lenders or the L/C Lenders, as applicable, following 
any such purchase. The provisions of this Section 2.18(k) shall not be 
construed to apply to (i) any payment made by or on behalf of the Borrower 
pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement 
(including the application of funds arising from the existence of a 
Defaulting Lender), (ii) the application of Cash Collateral provided for in 
Section 3.10, or (iii) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration 
for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or 
sub-participations in any L/C Exposure to any assignee or participant, 
other than an assignment to the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof (as to 
which the provisions of this Section shall apply). The Borrower consents on 
behalf of itself and each other Loan Party to the foregoing and agrees, to 
the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender 
acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may 
exercise against each Loan Party rights of setoff and counterclaim with 
respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct 
creditor of each Loan Party in the amount of such participation.
 
(l) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the 
Administrative Agent may, in its discretion at any time or from time to 
time, without the Borrower’s request and even if the conditions set forth 
in Section 5.2 would not be satisfied, make a Revolving Loan in an amount 
equal to the portion of the Obligations constituting overdue interest and 
fees and Swingline Loans from

49


time to time due and payable to itself, any Revolving Lender, the Swingline 
Lender or the Issuing Lender, and apply the proceeds of any such Revolving 
Loan to those Obligations; provided that after giving effect to any such 
Revolving Loan, the aggregate outstanding Revolving Loans will not exceed 
the Total Revolving Commitments then in effect.
 
2.19 Illegality; Requirements of Law.
 
(a) Illegality. If any Lender determines that any Requirement of Law has 
made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it 
is unlawful, for such Lender to make, maintain or fund Eurodollar Loans, or 
to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate, or 
any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the 
authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, 
Dollars in the London interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such 
Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, any obligation of 
such Lender to make or continue Eurodollar Loans or to convert ABR Loans to 
Eurodollar Loans shall be suspended until such Lender notifies the 
Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to 
such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, the 
Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the 
Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all Eurodollar 
Loans of such Lender to ABR Loans, either on the last day of the Interest 
Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such 
Eurodollar Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not 
lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Loans. Upon any such 
prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on 
the amount so prepaid or converted.
 
(b) Requirements of Law. If the adoption of or any change in any 
Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or application thereof or the 
compliance by any Lender with any request or directive (whether or not 
having the force of law) from any central bank or other Governmental 
Authority made subsequent to the date hereof:
 
(i) shall subject any Recipient to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified 
Taxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of 
Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes) on its Loans, loan 
principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its 
deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto;
 
(ii) shall impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, 
compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, 
deposits with or for the account of or credit extended or participated in 
by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement reflected in the Eurodollar 
Rate); or
 
(iii) impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other 
condition, cost or expense (other than Taxes) affecting this Agreement or 
Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;
 
and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such 
Lender or such other Recipient of making, converting to, continuing or 
maintaining Loans determined with reference to the Eurodollar Rate or of 
maintaining its obligation to make such Loans, or to increase the cost to 
such Lender or such other Recipient of issuing or participating in Letters 
of Credit, or to reduce any amount receivable or received by such Lender or 
other Recipient hereunder in respect thereof (whether in respect of 
principal, interest or any other amount), then, in any such case, upon the 
request of such Lender or other Recipient, the Borrower shall promptly pay 
such Lender or other Recipient, as the case may be, any additional amounts 
necessary to compensate such Lender or other Recipient, as the case may be, 
for such increased cost or reduced amount receivable. If any Lender becomes 
entitled to claim any additional amounts pursuant to this paragraph, it 
shall promptly notify the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative 
Agent) of the

50


event by reason of which it has become so entitled.
 
(c) If any Lender determines that any change in any Requirement of Law 
affecting such Lender or any lending office of such Lender or such Lender’s 
holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements, has 
or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s 
capital or on the capital of such Lender’s holding company, if any, as a 
consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans 
made by, or participations in Letters of Credit or Swingline Loans held by, 
such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by the Issuing Lender, to a 
level below that which such Lender or such Lender’s holding company could 
have achieved but for such change in such Requirement of Law (taking into 
consideration such Lender’s policies and the policies of such Lender’s 
holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time 
the Borrower will pay to such Lender or the Issuing Lender, as the case may 
be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the 
Issuing Lender or such Lender’s or Issuing Lender’s holding company for any 
such reduction suffered.
 
(d) For purposes of this Agreement, (i) the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform 
and Consumer Protection Act and all requests, rules, guidelines, or 
directives in connection therewith are deemed to have gone into effect and 
been adopted after the date of this Agreement, and (ii) all requests, 
rules, guidelines or directives promulgated by the Bank for International 
Settlements, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (or any successor 
or similar authority) or the United States regulatory authorities, in each 
case pursuant to Basel III, shall in each case be deemed to be a change in 
any Requirement of Law, regardless of the date enacted, adopted or issued.
 
(e) A certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to 
paragraphs (b), (c), or (d) of this Section submitted by any Lender to the 
Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) shall be conclusive in 
the absence of manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the 
amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt 
thereof. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation 
pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s 
right to demand such compensation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary 
in this Section 2.19, the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a 
Lender pursuant to this Section 2.19 for any amounts incurred more than 
nine months prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of 
such Lender’s intention to claim compensation therefor; provided that if 
the circumstances giving rise to such claim have a retroactive effect, then 
such nine-month period shall be extended to include the period of such 
retroactive effect. The obligations of the Borrower arising pursuant to 
this Section 2.19 shall survive the Discharge of Obligations and the 
resignation of the Administrative Agent.
 
2.20 Taxes.
 
For purposes of this Section 2.20, the term ‘Lender” includes the Issuing 
Lender and the term “applicable law” includes FATCA.
 
(a) Payments Free of Taxes. Any and all payments by or on account of any 
obligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document shall be made without 
deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable 
law and the Borrower shall, and shall cause each other Loan Party, to 
comply with the requirements set forth in this Section 2.20. If any 
applicable law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable 
Withholding Agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from 
any such payment by a Withholding Agent, then the applicable Withholding 
Agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall 
timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant 
Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law and, if such Tax 
is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party 
shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding 
has been made

51


(including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums 
payable under this Section 2.20) the applicable Recipient receives an 
amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or 
withholding been made.
 
(b) Payment of Other Taxes. The Borrower shall, and shall cause each other 
Loan Party to, timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in 
accordance with applicable law, or at the option of the Administrative 
Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes applicable to 
such Loan Party.
 
(c) Evidence of Payments. As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes 
by any Loan Party to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this Section 2.20
, the Borrower shall, or shall cause such other Loan Party to, deliver to 
the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt 
issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of 
the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment 
reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
 
(d) Indemnification by Loan Parties. The Borrower shall, and shall cause 
each other Loan Party to, jointly and severally indemnify each Recipient, 
within 10 days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any 
Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or 
attributable to amounts payable under this Section 2.20) payable or paid by 
such Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to 
such Recipient and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with 
respect thereto (including any recording and filing fees with respect 
thereto or resulting therefrom and any liabilities with respect to, or 
resulting from, any delay in paying such Indemnified Taxes), whether or not 
such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the 
relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such 
payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to 
the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf 
or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error; 
provided, that the Loan Parties shall not be required to indemnify a 
Recipient pursuant to this Section 2.20 to the extent that such Recipient 
fails to notify the Loan Parties of its intent to make a claim for 
indemnification under this section 2.20 within 270 days after a claim is 
asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. If any Loan Party fails to 
pay any Taxes when due to the appropriate taxing authority or fails to 
remit to the Administrative Agent the required receipts or other required 
documentary evidence, such Loan Party shall indemnify the Administrative 
Agent and the Lenders for any incremental taxes, interest or penalties that 
may become payable by the Administrative Agent or any Lender as a result of 
any such failure.
 
(e) Indemnification by Lenders. Each Lender shall severally indemnify the 
Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for (i) any 
Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that 
any Loan Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for 
such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Loan 
Parties to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender’s failure to 
comply with the provisions of Section 10.6 relating to the maintenance of a 
Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such 
Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent 
in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising 
therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly 
or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A 
certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any 
Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest 
error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off 
and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any 
Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to the 
Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative 
Agent under this paragraph (e). Any amounts set off by the Administrative 
Agent pursuant to the preceding sentence shall, to the extent

52


such amounts relate to any Loan Document be treated as having been paid in 
accordance with, and for purposes of, such Loan Document.
 
(f) Status of Lenders.
 
(i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of 
withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall 
deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times 
reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such 
properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the 
Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be 
made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, 
any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative 
Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law 
or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will 
enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not 
such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting 
requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two 
sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation 
(other than such documentation set forth in Sections 2.20(f)(ii)(A), 
(ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if the Lender is not 
legally entitled to complete, execute or deliver such documentation or, in 
the Lender’s reasonable judgment, such completion, execution or submission 
would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or 
would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.
 
(ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that 
the Borrower is a U.S. Person,
 
(A) any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the 
Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a 
Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the 
reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed 
originals of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. 
Federal backup withholding Tax;
 
(B) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do 
so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of 
copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on 
which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from 
time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the 
Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:
 
(1) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax 
treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments 
of interest under any Loan Document, executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN 
establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. Federal withholding 
Tax pursuant to the “interest” article of such tax treaty and (y) with 
respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form 
W-8BEN establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. Federal 
withholding Tax pursuant to the “business profits” or “other income” 
article of such tax treaty;
 
(2) executed originals of IRS Form W-8ECI;
 
(3) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption 
for portfolio interest under Section 871(h) or Section 881(c) of the Code, 
(x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit F-1 to the effect 
that such Foreign Lender is not a “bank” within the meaning of Section 
881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a “10 percent shareholder” of the Borrower within 
the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a “controlled foreign 
corporation” described in Section

53


881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a “U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate”) and (y) 
executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN; or
 
(4) to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed 
originals of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form 
W-8BEN, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of 
Exhibit F-2 or Exhibit F-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification 
documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the 
Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners 
of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such 
Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially 
in the form of Exhibit F-4 on behalf of each such direct or indirect 
partner;
 
(C) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do 
so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of 
copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on 
which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from 
time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the 
Administrative Agent), executed originals of any other form prescribed by 
applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in 
U.S. Federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such 
supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to 
permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the 
withholding or deduction required to be made; and
 
(D) if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject 
to U.S. Federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to 
fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA 
(including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as 
applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the 
Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such 
time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative 
Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as 
prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional 
documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative 
Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to 
comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender 
has complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the 
amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of 
this clause (D), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after 
the date of this Agreement.
 
(iii) Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously 
delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it 
shall promptly update such form or certification or promptly notify the 
Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to 
do so. Each Foreign Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower at any time 
it determines that it is no longer in a position to provide any previously 
delivered certificate to the Borrower (or any other form of certification 
adopted by the U.S. taxing authorities for such purpose). Notwithstanding 
any other provision of this paragraph, a Foreign Lender shall not be 
required to deliver any form pursuant to this paragraph that such Foreign 
Lender is not legally able to deliver.
 
(iv) To the extent legally permissible, the Administrative Agent, in the 
event that the Administrative Agent is a U.S. Person, shall deliver an IRS 
Form W-9 to the Borrower and if the Administrative Agent is not a U.S. 
Person, the applicable IRS Form W-8 certifying its exemption from U.S. 
withholding Taxes with respect to amounts payable hereunder, on or prior to 
the date the Administrative Agent becomes a party to this Agreement.
 
(g) Treatment of Certain Refunds. If any party determines, in its sole 
discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any 
Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section 2.20 
(including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this

54


Section 2.20), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to 
such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this 
Section 2.20 with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of 
all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such indemnified party and 
without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental 
Authority with respect to such refund). Such indemnifying party, upon the 
request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party 
the amount paid over pursuant to this paragraph (g) (plus any penalties, 
interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) 
in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund 
to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in 
this paragraph (g), in no event will the indemnified party be required to 
pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this paragraph (g) the 
payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net 
after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax 
subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been 
deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or 
additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This 
paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make 
available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes 
that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.
 
(h) Survival. Each party’s obligations under this Section 2.20 shall 
survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent, any 
assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, and the Discharge 
of Obligations.
 
2.21 Indemnity. The Borrower agrees to indemnify each Lender for, and to 
hold each Lender harmless from, any loss or expense that such Lender may 
sustain or incur as a consequence of (a) a default by the Borrower in 
making a borrowing of, conversion into or continuation of Eurodollar Loans 
after the Borrower has given a notice requesting the same in accordance 
with the provisions of this Agreement, (b) a default by the Borrower in 
making any prepayment of or conversion from Eurodollar Loans after the 
Borrower has given a notice thereof in accordance with the provisions of 
this Agreement, or (c) for any reason, the making of a prepayment of 
Eurodollar Loans on a day that is not the last day of an Interest Period 
with respect thereto. Such losses and expenses shall be equal to the 
excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest that would have accrued on 
the amount so prepaid, or not so borrowed, reduced, converted or continued, 
for the period from the date of such prepayment or of such failure to 
borrow, reduce, convert or continue to the last day of such Interest Period 
(or, in the case of a failure to borrow, reduce, convert or continue, the 
Interest Period that would have commenced on the date of such failure) in 
each case at the applicable rate of interest or other return for such Loans 
provided for herein (excluding, however, the Applicable Margin included 
therein, if any), over (ii) the amount of interest (as reasonably 
determined by such Lender) that would have accrued to such Lender on such 
amount by placing such amount on deposit for a comparable period with 
leading banks in the interbank eurodollar market. A certificate as to any 
amounts payable pursuant to this Section submitted to the Borrower by any 
Lender shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. This covenant 
shall survive the Discharge of Obligations.
 
2.22 Change of Lending Office. Each Lender agrees that, upon the occurrence 
of any event giving rise to the operation of Section 2.19(b), Section 
2.19(c), Section 2.20(a) or Section 2.20(d) with respect to such Lender, it 
will, if requested by the Borrower, use reasonable efforts (subject to 
overall policy considerations of such Lender) to designate a different 
lending office for funding or booking its Loans affected by such event or 
to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, 
branches or affiliates, in each case, with the object of avoiding the 
consequences of such event; provided that such designation is made on terms 
that, in the sole judgment of such Lender, cause such Lender and its 
lending office(s) to suffer no economic, legal, or regulatory disadvantage; 
provided further that nothing in this Section shall affect or postpone any 
of the obligations of the Borrower or the rights of any Lender pursuant to 
Section 2.19(b), Section 2.19(c), Section 2.20(a) or Section 2.20(d). The 
Borrower hereby

55


agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in 
connection with any such designation or assignment made at the request of 
the Borrower.
 
2.23 Substitution of Lenders. Upon the receipt by the Borrower of any of 
the following (or in the case of clause (a) below, if the Borrower is 
required to pay any such amount), with respect to any Lender (any such 
Lender described in clauses (a) through (c) below being referred to as an “
Affected Lender” hereunder):
 
(a) a request from a Lender for payment of Indemnified Taxes or additional 
amounts under Section 2.20 or of increased costs pursuant to Section 2.19 
(and, in any such case, such Lender has declined or is unable to designate 
a different lending office in accordance with Section 2.22 or is a 
Non-Consenting Lender);
 
(b) a notice from the Administrative Agent under Section 10.1(b) that one 
or more Minority Lenders are unwilling to agree to an amendment or other 
modification approved by the Required Lenders and the Administrative Agent; 
or
 
(c) notice from the Administrative Agent that a Lender is a Defaulting 
Lender;
 
then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to the 
Administrative Agent and such Affected Lender: (i) request that one or more 
of the other Lenders acquire and assume all or part of such Affected 
Lender’s Loans and Commitments; or (ii) designate a replacement lending 
institution (which shall be an Eligible Assignee) to acquire and assume all 
or a ratable part of such Affected Lender’s Loans and Commitments (the 
replacing Lender or lender in (i) or (ii) being a “Replacement Lender”); 
provided, however, that the Borrower shall be liable for the payment upon 
demand of all costs and other amounts arising under Section 2.21 (subject 
to Section 2.25) that result from the acquisition of any Affected Lender’s 
Loan and/or Commitments (or any portion thereof) by a Lender or Replacement 
Lender, as the case may be, on a date other than the last day of the 
applicable Interest Period with respect to any Eurodollar Loans then 
outstanding; and provided further, however, that if the Borrower elects to 
exercise such right with respect to any Affected Lender under clause (a) or 
(b) of this Section 2.23, then the Borrower shall be obligated to replace 
all Affected Lenders under such clauses. The Affected Lender replaced 
pursuant to this Section 2.23 shall be required to assign and delegate, 
without recourse, all of its interests, rights and obligations under this 
Agreement and the related Loan Documents to one or more Replacement Lenders 
that so agree to acquire and assume all or a ratable part of such Affected 
Lender’s Loans and Commitments upon payment to such Affected Lender of an 
amount (in the aggregate for all Replacement Lenders) equal to 100% of the 
outstanding principal of the Affected Lender’s Loans, accrued interest 
thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and 
under the other Loan Documents from such Replacement Lenders (to the extent 
of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the 
Borrower (in the case of all other amounts, including amounts under 
Section 2.21 hereof). Any such designation of a Replacement Lender shall be 
effected in accordance with, and subject to the terms and conditions of, 
the assignment provisions contained in Section 10.6 (with the assignment 
fee to be paid by the Borrower in such instance), and, if such Replacement 
Lender is not already a Lender hereunder or an Affiliate of a Lender or an 
Approved Fund, shall be subject to the prior written consent of the 
Administrative Agent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any assignment pursuant to 
this Section 2.23, (a) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a 
claim for compensation under Section 2.19 or payments required to be made 
pursuant to Section 2.20, such assignment shall result in a reduction in 
such compensation or payments thereafter; (b) such assignment shall not 
conflict with applicable law and (c) in the case of any assignment 
resulting from a Lender being a Minority Lender referred to in clause (b) 
of this Section 2.23, the applicable assignee shall have consented to the 
applicable amendment, waiver or consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an 
Affected Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or

56


delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Affected 
Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require 
such assignment and delegation cease to apply.
 
2.24 Defaulting Lenders.
 
(a) Adjustments. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this 
Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time 
as such Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by 
applicable law:
 
(i) Waivers and Amendments. Such Defaulting Lender’s right to approve or 
disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement 
shall be restricted as set forth in Section 10.1 and in the definitions of 
Majority Revolving Lenders, Majority Term Lenders and Required Lenders.
 
(ii) Defaulting Lender Waterfall. Any payment of principal, interest, fees 
or other amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the account of 
such Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, 
pursuant to Section 8 or otherwise, and including any amounts made 
available to the Administrative Agent by such Defaulting Lender pursuant to 
Section 10.7), shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined 
by the Administrative Agent as follows: first, to the payment of any 
amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent 
hereunder; second, to the payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts owing 
by such Defaulting Lender to the Issuing Lender or to the Swingline Lender 
hereunder; third, to be held as Cash Collateral for the funding obligations 
of such Defaulting Lender of any participation in any Letter of Credit; 
fourth, as the Borrower may request (so long as no Default or Event of 
Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which such 
Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by 
this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent; fifth, if so 
determined by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to be held in a 
deposit account and released pro rata in order to (x) satisfy such 
Defaulting Lender’s potential future funding obligations with respect to 
Loans under this Agreement, and (y) be held as Cash Collateral for the 
future funding obligations of such Defaulting Lender of any participation 
in any future Letter of Credit; sixth, to the payment of any amounts owing 
to any L/C Lender, the Issuing Lender or the Swingline Lender as a result 
of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any L/C 
Lender, the Issuing Lender or the Swingline Lender against such Defaulting 
Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations 
under this Agreement; seventh, so long as no Default or Event of Default 
has occurred and is continuing, to the payment of any amounts owing to the 
Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction 
obtained by the Borrower against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such 
Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and 
eighth, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of 
competent jurisdiction; provided that if (A) such payment is a payment of 
the principal amount of any Loans or L/C Advances in respect of which such 
Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share and (B) such 
Loans or L/C Advances were made at a time when the conditions set forth in 
Section 5.2 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely 
to pay the Loans of, and L/C Advances owed to, all non-Defaulting Lenders 
on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of, 
or L/C Advances owed to, such Defaulting Lender until such time as all 
Loans and funded and unfunded participations in L/C Advances and Swingline 
Loans are held by the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the Commitments 
under the applicable Facility without giving effect to Section 2.24(a)(iv)
. Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a 
Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a 
Defaulting Lender or to post Cash Collateral pursuant to this Section 
2.24(a)(ii) shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting 
Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.
 
(iii) Certain Fees.

57


(A) No Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive any fee pursuant to 
Section 2.9(b) for any period during which such Lender is a Defaulting 
Lender (and the Borrower shall not be required to pay any such fee that 
otherwise would have been required to have been paid to such Defaulting 
Lender).
 
(B) Each Defaulting Lender shall be limited in its right to receive Letter 
of Credit Fees as provided in Section 3.3(d).
 
(C) With respect to any Letter of Credit Fee not required to be paid to any 
Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (A) or (B) above, the Borrower shall 
(x) pay to each Non-Defaulting Lender that portion of any such Letter of 
Credit Fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender with respect to such 
Defaulting Lender’s participation in Letters of Credit or Swingline Loans 
that has been reallocated to such Non-Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause 
(iv) below, (y) pay to the Issuing Lender and to the Swingline Lender, as 
applicable, the amount of any such fee or Letter of Credit Fee, as 
applicable, otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender to the extent 
allocable to the Issuing Lender’s or the Swingline Lender’s Fronting 
Exposure to such Defaulting Lender, and (z) not be required to pay the 
remaining amount of any such fee or Letter of Credit Fee, as applicable.
 
(iv) Reallocation of Pro Rata Share to Reduce Fronting Exposure. During any 
period in which there is a Defaulting Lender, for purposes of computing the 
amount of the obligation of each non-Defaulting Lender to acquire, 
refinance or fund participations in Letters of Credit pursuant to Section 
3.4 or in Swingline Loans pursuant to Section 2.7(c), the L/C Percentage of 
each non-Defaulting Lender of any such Letter of Credit and the Revolving 
Percentage of each non-Defaulting Lender of any such Swingline Loan, as the 
case may be, shall be computed without giving effect to the Revolving 
Commitment of such Defaulting Lender; provided that, (A) each such 
reallocation shall be given effect only if, at the date the applicable 
Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, no Event of Default has occurred and is 
continuing; (B) the aggregate obligations of each non-Defaulting Lender to 
acquire, refinance or fund participations in Letters of Credit and 
Swingline Loans shall not exceed the positive difference, if any, of (1) 
the Revolving Commitment of that non-Defaulting Lender minus (2) the 
aggregate outstanding amount of the Revolving Loans of that Lender plus the 
aggregate amount of that Lender’s L/C Percentage of then outstanding 
Letters of Credit, plus the aggregate amount of that Lender’s Revolving 
Percentage of any Swingline Loans and (C) the conditions set forth in 
Section 5.2 are satisfied at the time of such reallocation (and, unless the 
Borrower shall have otherwise notified the Administrative Agent at such 
time, the Borrower shall be deemed to have represented and warranted that 
such conditions are satisfied at such time). No reallocation hereunder 
shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder 
against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a 
Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a non-Defaulting Lender as a 
result of such non-Defaulting Lender’s increased exposure following such 
reallocation.
 
(v) Cash Collateral, Repayment of Swingline Loans. If the reallocation 
described in clause (iv) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, 
the Borrower shall, without prejudice to any right or remedy available to 
it hereunder or under law and subject to Section 2.25, (x) first, prepay 
Swingline Loans in an amount equal to the Swingline Lender’s Fronting 
Exposure, and (y) second, Cash Collateralize the Issuing Lender’s Fronting 
Exposure in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 3.10.
 
(b) Defaulting Lender Cure. If the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the 
Swingline Lender and the Issuing Lender agree in writing in their sole 
discretion that a Defaulting Lender should no longer be deemed to be a 
Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties 
hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and 
subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements 
with respect to any Cash Collateral), such

58


Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par that portion of 
outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the 
Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Loans and 
funded and unfunded participations in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans 
to be held on a pro rata basis by the Lenders in accordance with their 
respective Revolving Percentages, L/C Percentages and Term Percentages, as 
applicable (without giving effect to Section 2.24(a)(iv)), whereupon such 
Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments 
will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by 
or on behalf of the Borrower while such Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and 
provided, further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by 
the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender 
will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder 
arising from such Lender having been a Defaulting Lender.
 
(c) New Swingline Loans/Letters of Credit. So long as any Lender is a 
Defaulting Lender, (i) the Swingline Lender shall not be required to fund 
any Swingline Loans unless it is satisfied that it will have no Fronting 
Exposure after giving effect to such Swingline Loan and (ii) the Issuing 
Lender shall not be required to issue, extend, renew or increase any Letter 
of Credit unless it is satisfied that it will have no Fronting Exposure in 
respect of Letters of Credit after giving effect thereto.
 
(d) Termination of Defaulting Lender. The Borrower may terminate the unused 
amount of the Revolving Commitment of any Revolving Lender that is a 
Defaulting Lender upon not less than ten (10) Business Days’ prior notice 
to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly notify the Lenders 
thereof), and in such event the provisions of Section 2.24(a)(ii) will 
apply to all amounts thereafter paid by the Borrower for the account of 
such Defaulting Lender under this Agreement (whether on account of 
principal, interest, fees, indemnity or other amounts); provided that (i) 
no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, and (ii) such 
termination shall not be deemed to be a waiver or release of any claim the 
Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender, the Swingline Bank 
or any other Lender may have against such Defaulting Lender.
 
2.25 Joint and Several Liability of the Borrowers.
 
(a) Each Borrower is accepting joint and several liability hereunder and 
under the other Loan Documents in consideration of the financial 
accommodations to be provided by the Lenders under this Agreement, for the 
mutual benefit, directly and indirectly, of each Borrower and in 
consideration of the undertakings of the other the Borrowers to accept 
joint and several liability for the Obligations.
 
(b) Each Borrower, jointly and severally, hereby irrevocably and 
unconditionally accepts, not merely as a surety but also as a co-debtor, 
joint and several liability with the other the Borrowers, with respect to 
the payment and performance of all of the Obligations (including any 
Obligations arising under this Section 2.25), it being the intention of the 
parties hereto that all the Obligations shall be the joint and several 
obligations of each Borrower without preferences or distinction among them.
 
(c) If and to the extent that any Borrower shall fail to make any payment 
with respect to any of the Obligations as and when due or to perform any of 
the Obligations in accordance with the terms thereof, then in each such 
event the other Borrowers will make such payment with respect to, or 
perform, such Obligations.
 
(d) The Obligations of each Borrower under the provisions of this Section 
2.25 constitute the absolute and unconditional, full recourse Obligations 
of each Borrower enforceable

59


against each Borrower to the full extent of its properties and assets, 
irrespective of the validity, regularity or enforceability of this 
Agreement or any other circumstances whatsoever.
 
(e) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, each Borrower 
hereby waives notice of acceptance of its joint and several liability, 
notice of any Loans made or Letters of Credit issued under or pursuant to 
this Agreement, notice of the occurrence of any Default, Event of Default, 
or of any demand for any payment under this Agreement, notice of any action 
at any time taken or omitted by the Administrative Agent or Lenders under 
or in respect of any of the Obligations, any requirement of diligence or to 
mitigate damages and, generally, to the extent permitted by applicable law, 
all demands, notices and other formalities of every kind in connection with 
this Agreement (except as otherwise provided in this Agreement). Each 
Borrower hereby assents to, and waives notice of, any extension or 
postponement of the time for the payment of any of the Obligations, the 
acceptance of any payment of any of the Obligations, the acceptance of any 
partial payment thereon, any waiver, consent or other action or 
acquiescence by the Administrative Agent or Lenders at any time or times in 
respect of any default by any Borrower in the performance or satisfaction 
of any term, covenant, condition or provision of this Agreement, any and 
all other indulgences whatsoever by the Administrative Agent or Lenders in 
respect of any of the Obligations, and the taking, addition, substitution 
or release, in whole or in part, at any time or times, of any security for 
any of the Obligations or the addition, substitution or release, in whole 
or in part, of any Borrower. Without limiting the generality of the 
foregoing, each Borrower assents to any other action or delay in acting or 
failure to act on the part of the Administrative Agent or Lender with 
respect to the failure by any Borrower to comply with any of its respective 
Obligations, including, without limitation, any failure strictly or 
diligently to assert any right or to pursue any remedy or to comply fully 
with applicable laws or regulations thereunder, which might, but for the 
provisions of this Section 2.25 afford grounds for terminating, discharging 
or relieving any Borrower, in whole or in part, from any of its Obligations 
under this Section 2.25, it being the intention of each Borrower that, so 
long as any of the Obligations hereunder remain unsatisfied, the 
Obligations of each Borrower under this Section 2.25 shall not be 
discharged except by performance and then only to the extent of such 
performance. The Obligations of each Borrower under this Section 2.25 
shall not be diminished or rendered unenforceable by any winding up, 
reorganization, arrangement, liquidation, reconstruction or similar 
proceeding with respect to any Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any 
Lender.
 
(f) Each Borrower represents and warrants to the Administrative Agent and 
Lenders that such Borrower is currently informed of the financial condition 
of the Borrowers and of all other circumstances which a diligent inquiry 
would reveal and which bear upon the risk of nonpayment of the Obligations. 
Each Borrower further represents and warrants to the Administrative Agent 
and Lenders that such Borrower has read and understands the terms and 
conditions of the Loan Documents. Each Borrower hereby covenants that such 
Borrower will continue to keep informed of the Borrowers’ financial 
condition, the financial condition of other guarantors, if any, and of all 
other circumstances which bear upon the risk of nonpayment or 
nonperformance of the Obligations.
 
(g) Each Borrower waives all rights and defenses arising out of an election 
of remedies by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, even though that 
election of remedies, such as a nonjudicial foreclosure with respect to 
security for a guaranteed obligation, has destroyed the Administrative 
Agent’s or such Lender’s rights of subrogation and reimbursement against 
such Borrower by the operation of Section 580(d) of the California Code of 
Civil Procedure or otherwise:
 
(h) Each Borrower waives all rights and defenses that such Borrower may 
have because the Obligations are secured by real property at any time. This 
means, among other things:

60


(i) The Administrative Agent and Lenders may collect from such Borrower 
without first foreclosing on any real or personal property Collateral 
pledged by the Borrowers.
 
(ii) If the Administrative Agent or any Lender forecloses on any Collateral 
consisting of real property pledged by the Borrowers:
 
(A) The amount of the Obligations may be reduced only by the price for 
which that collateral is sold at the foreclosure sale, even if the 
collateral is worth more than the sale price.
 
(B) The Administrative Agent and Lenders may collect from such Borrower 
even if the Administrative Agent or Lenders, by foreclosing on real 
property, has destroyed any right such Borrower may have to collect from 
the other Borrowers.
 
This is an unconditional and irrevocable waiver of any rights and defenses 
such Borrower may have because the Obligations are secured by real 
property. These rights and defenses include, but are not limited to, any 
rights or defenses based upon Section 580a, 580b, 580d or 726 of the 
California Code of Civil Procedure.
 
(i) The provisions of this Section 2.25 are made for the benefit of the 
Administrative Agent, Lenders and their respective successors and assigns, 
and may be enforced by it or them from time to time against any or all the 
Borrowers as often as occasion therefor may arise and without requirement 
on the part of the Administrative Agent, any Lender, any successor or any 
assign first to marshal any of its or their claims or to exercise any of 
its or their rights against any Borrower or to exhaust any remedies 
available to it or them against any Borrower or to resort to any other 
source or means of obtaining payment of any of the Obligations hereunder or 
to elect any other remedy. The provisions of this Section 2.25 shall remain 
in effect until all of the Obligations shall have been paid in full or 
otherwise fully satisfied. If at any time, any payment, or any part 
thereof, made in respect of any of the Obligations, is rescinded or must 
otherwise be restored or returned by the Administrative Agent or any Lender 
upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of any Borrower, or 
otherwise, the provisions of this Section 2.25 will forthwith be reinstated 
in effect, as though such payment had not been made.
 
(j) Each Borrower hereby agrees that it will not enforce any of its rights 
of contribution or subrogation against any other Borrower with respect to 
any liability incurred by it hereunder or under any of the other Loan 
Documents, any payments made by it to the Administrative Agent or Lenders 
with respect to any of the Obligations or any collateral security therefor 
until such time as all of the Obligations have been paid in full in cash. 
Any claim which any Borrower may have against any other Borrower with 
respect to any payments to the Administrative Agent or Lender hereunder or 
under any other Loan Documents are hereby expressly made subordinate and 
junior in right of payment, without limitation as to any increases in the 
Obligations arising hereunder or thereunder, to the prior payment in full 
in cash of the Obligations and, in the event of any insolvency, bankruptcy, 
receivership, liquidation, reorganization or other similar proceeding under 
the laws of any jurisdiction relating to any Borrower, its debts or its 
assets, whether voluntary or involuntary, all such Obligations shall be 
paid in full in cash before any payment or distribution of any character, 
whether in cash, securities or other property, shall be made to any other 
Borrower therefor. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in 
this Section 2.25, no Borrower shall exercise any rights of subrogation, 
contribution, indemnity, reimbursement or other similar rights against, and 
shall not proceed or seek recourse against or with respect to any property 
or asset of, any other Borrower (the “Foreclosed Borrower”), including 
after payment in full of the Obligations, if all or any portion of the

61


Obligations have been satisfied in connection with an exercise of remedies 
in respect of the Capital Stock of such Foreclosed Borrower whether 
pursuant to the Security Documents or otherwise.
 
(k) Each Borrower hereby agrees that, after the occurrence and during the 
continuance of any Default or Event of Default, the payment of any amounts 
due with respect to the indebtedness owing by any Borrower to any other 
Borrower is hereby subordinated to the prior payment in full in cash of the 
Obligations. Each Borrower hereby agrees that after the occurrence and 
during the continuance of any Default or Event of Default, such Borrower 
will not demand, sue for or otherwise attempt to collect any indebtedness 
of any other Borrower owing to such Borrower until the Obligations shall 
have been paid in full in cash. If, notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, 
such Borrower shall collect, enforce or receive any amounts in respect of 
such indebtedness, such amounts shall be collected, enforced and received 
by such Borrower as trustee for the Administrative Agent, and such Borrower 
shall deliver any such amounts to the Administrative Agent for application 
to the Obligations in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
 
(l) Subject to the foregoing, to the extent that any Borrower shall, under 
this Agreement as a joint and several obligor, repay any of the Obligations 
made to another Borrower hereunder or other Obligations incurred directly 
and primarily by any other Borrower (an “Accommodation Payment”), then the 
Borrower making such Accommodation Payment shall be entitled to 
contribution and indemnification from, and be reimbursed by, each other 
Borrower in an amount, for each of such other Borrower, equal to a fraction 
of such Accommodation Payment, the numerator of which fraction is such 
other Borrower’s Allocable Amount and the denominator of which is the sum 
of the Allocable Amounts of all of the Borrowers. As of any date of 
determination, the “Allocable Amount” of each Borrower shall be equal to 
the maximum amount of liability for Accommodation Payments which could be 
asserted against such Borrower hereunder without (a) rendering such 
Borrower “insolvent” within the meaning of Section 101(31) of the 
Bankruptcy Code, Section 2 of the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act (“UFTA”) 
or Section 2 of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act (“UFCA”), (b) leaving 
such Borrower with unreasonably small capital or assets, within the meaning 
of Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code, Section 4 of the UFTA, or Section 5 
of the UFCA, or (c) leaving such Borrower unable to pay its debts as they 
become due within the meaning of Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code or 
Section 4 of the UFTA, or Section 5 of the UFCA.
 
2.26 Notes. If so requested by any Lender by written notice to the Borrower 
(with a copy to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall execute and 
deliver to such Lender (and/or, if applicable and if so specified in such 
notice, to any Person who is an assignee of such Lender pursuant to 
Section 10.6) (promptly after the Borrower’s receipt of such notice) a Note 
or Notes to evidence such Lender’s Loans.
 
2.27 EDH as Administrative Borrower. Each Borrower hereby irrevocably 
appoints EDH as the borrowing agent and attorney-in-fact for all Persons 
composing the Borrower (the “Administrative Borrower”) which appointment 
shall remain in full force and effect unless and until the Administrative 
Agent shall have received prior written notice signed by each Borrower that 
such appointment has been revoked and that another Borrower has been 
appointed Administrative Borrower. Each Borrower hereby irrevocably 
appoints and authorizes the Administrative Borrower (a) to provide the 
Administrative Agent with all notices and to receive all notices on behalf 
of each other Borrower with respect to Loans and Letters of Credit obtained 
for the benefit of any Borrower and all other notices and instructions 
under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and (b) to take such 
action as the Administrative Borrower deems appropriate on its behalf to 
obtain Loans and Letters of Credit and to exercise such other powers as are 
reasonably incidental thereto to carry out the purposes of this Agreement 
and the other Loan Documents.

SECTION 3
LETTERS OF CREDIT
 
3.1 L/C Commitment.
 
(a) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Issuing Lender agrees 
to issue standby letters of credit (“Letters of Credit”) for the account of 
the Borrower on any Business Day during the Letter of Credit Availability 
Period in such form as may reasonably be approved from time to time by the 
Issuing Lender; provided that the Issuing Lender shall have no obligation 
to issue any Letter of Credit if, after giving effect to such issuance, the 
L/C Exposure would exceed either the Total L/C Commitments or the Available 
Revolving Commitment at such time. Each Letter of Credit shall (i) be 
denominated in Dollars and (ii) expire no later than the earlier of (x) the 
first anniversary of its date of issuance and (y) the Letter of Credit 
Maturity Date, provided that any Letter of Credit with a one-year term may 
provide for the renewal thereof for additional one-year periods (which 
shall in no event extend beyond the date referred to in clause (y) above). 
For the avoidance of doubt, no commercial letters of credit shall be issued 
by the Issuing Lender to any Person under this Agreement.
 
(b) The Issuing Lender shall not at any time be obligated to issue any 
Letter of Credit if:
 
(i) such issuance would conflict with, or cause the Issuing Lender or any 
L/C Lender to exceed any limits imposed by, any applicable Requirement of 
Law;
 
(ii) any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority or 
arbitrator shall by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain the Issuing 
Lender from issuing, amending or reinstating such Letter of Credit, or any 
law, rule or regulation applicable to the Issuing Lender or any request, 
guideline or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any 
Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over the Issuing Lender shall 
prohibit, or request that the Issuing Lender refrain from, the issuance, 
amendment, renewal or reinstatement of letters of credit generally or such 
Letter of Credit in particular or shall impose upon the Issuing Lender with 
respect to such Letter of Credit any restriction, reserve or capital 
requirement (for which the Issuing Lender is not otherwise compensated) not 
in effect on the Closing Date, or shall impose upon the Issuing Lender any 
unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which was not applicable on the Closing 
Date and which the Issuing Lender in good faith deems material to it;
 
(iii) the Issuing Lender has received written notice from any Lender, the 
Administrative Agent or the Borrower, at least one (1) Business Day prior 
to the requested date of issuance, amendment, renewal or reinstatement of 
such Letter of Credit, that one or more of the applicable conditions 
contained in Section 5.2 shall not then be satisfied (which notice shall 
contain a description of any such condition asserted not to be satisfied);
 
(iv) any requested Letter of Credit is not in form and substance acceptable 
to the Issuing Lender, or the issuance, amendment or renewal of a Letter of 
Credit shall violate any applicable laws or regulations or any applicable 
policies of the Issuing Lender;
 
(v) such Letter of Credit contains any provisions providing for automatic 
reinstatement of the stated amount after any drawing thereunder;
 
(vi) except as otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent and the Issuing 
Lender, such Letter of Credit is in an initial face amount less than 
$100,000; or

63


(vii) any Lender is at that time a Defaulting Lender, unless the Issuing 
Lender has entered into arrangements, including the delivery of Cash 
Collateral pursuant to Section 3.10, satisfactory to the Issuing Lender (in 
its sole discretion) with the Borrower or such Defaulting Lender to 
eliminate the Issuing Lender’s actual or potential Fronting Exposure (after 
giving effect to Section 2.24(a)(iv)) with respect to the Defaulting Lender 
arising from either the Letter of Credit then proposed to be issued or such 
Letter of Credit and all other L/C Exposure as to which the Issuing Lender 
has actual or potential Fronting Exposure, as it may elect in its sole 
discretion.
 
3.2 Procedure for Issuance of Letters of Credit. The Borrower may from time 
to time request that the Issuing Lender issue a Letter of Credit for the 
account of the Borrower by delivering to the Issuing Lender at its address 
for notices specified herein an Application therefor, completed to the 
satisfaction of the Issuing Lender, and such other certificates, documents 
and other papers and information as the Issuing Lender may request. Upon 
receipt of any Application, the Issuing Lender will process such 
Application and the certificates, documents and other papers and 
information delivered to it in connection therewith in accordance with its 
customary procedures and shall promptly issue the Letter of Credit 
requested thereby (but in no event shall the Issuing Lender be required to 
issue any Letter of Credit earlier than three (3) Business Days after its 
receipt of the Application therefor and all such other certificates, 
documents and other papers and information relating thereto) by issuing the 
original of such Letter of Credit to the beneficiary thereof or as 
otherwise may be agreed to by the Issuing Lender and the Borrower. The 
Issuing Lender shall furnish a copy of such Letter of Credit to the 
Borrower promptly following the issuance thereof. The Issuing Lender shall 
promptly furnish to the Administrative Agent, which shall in turn promptly 
furnish to the Lenders, notice of the issuance of each Letter of Credit 
(including the amount thereof).
 
3.3 Fees and Other Charges.
 
(a) The Borrower agrees to pay, with respect to each Existing Letter of 
Credit and each outstanding Letter of Credit issued for the account of (or 
at the request of) the Borrower, (i) a fronting fee of 0.125% per annum on 
the daily amount available to be drawn under each such Letter of Credit to 
the Issuing Lender for its own account (a “Letter of Credit Fronting Fee
”), (ii) a letter of credit fee equal to the Applicable Margin for 
Revolving Loans that are Eurodollar Loans multiplied by the daily amount 
available to be drawn under each such Letter of Credit on the drawable 
amount of such Letter of Credit to the Administrative Agent for the ratable 
account of the L/C Lenders (determined in accordance with their respective 
L/C Percentages) (a “Letter of Credit Fee”), and (iii) the Issuing Lender’s 
standard and reasonable fees with respect to the issuance, amendment, 
renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit issued for the account of (or 
at the request of) the Borrower or processing of drawings thereunder (the 
fees in this clause (iii), collectively, the “Issuing Lender Fees”). The 
Issuing Lender Fees shall be paid when required by the Issuing Lender, and 
the Letter of Credit Fronting Fee and the Letter of Credit Fee shall be 
payable quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of March, June, 
September and December of each year and on the Letter of Credit Maturity 
Date (each, an “L/C Fee Payment Date”) after the issuance date of such 
Letter of Credit. All Letter of Credit Fronting Fees and Letter of Credit 
Fees shall be computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in 
a year of 360 days.
 
(b) In addition to the foregoing fees, the Borrower shall pay or reimburse 
the Issuing Lender for such normal and customary costs and expenses as are 
incurred or charged by the Issuing Lender in issuing, negotiating, 
effecting payment under, amending or otherwise administering any Letter of 
Credit.
 
(c) The Borrower shall furnish to the Issuing Lender and the Administrative 
Agent such other documents and information pertaining to any requested 
Letter of Credit issuance,

64


amendment or renewal, including any L/C-Related Documents, as the Issuing 
Lender or the Administrative Agent may require. This Agreement shall 
control in the event of any conflict with any L/C-Related Document (other 
than any Letter of Credit).
 
(d) Any Letter of Credit Fees otherwise payable for the account of a 
Defaulting Lender with respect to any Letter of Credit as to which such 
Defaulting Lender has not provided Cash Collateral satisfactory to the 
Issuing Lender pursuant to Section 3.10 shall be payable, to the maximum 
extent permitted by applicable law, to the other L/C Lenders in accordance 
with the upward adjustments in their respective L/C Percentages allocable 
to such Letter of Credit pursuant to Section 2.24(a)(iv), with the balance 
of such Letter of Credit Fees, if any, payable to the Issuing Lender for 
its own account.
 
(e) All fees payable pursuant to this Section 3.3 shall be fully-earned on 
the date paid and shall not be refundable for any reason.
 
3.4 L/C Participations; Existing Letters of Credit.
 
(a) L/C Participations. The Issuing Lender irrevocably agrees to grant and 
hereby grants to each L/C Lender, and, to induce the Issuing Lender to 
issue Letters of Credit, each L/C Lender irrevocably agrees to accept and 
purchase and hereby accepts and purchases from the Issuing Lender, on the 
terms and conditions set forth below, for such L/C Lender’s own account and 
risk an undivided interest equal to such L/C Lender’s L/C Percentage in the 
Issuing Lender’s obligations and rights under and in respect of each Letter 
of Credit and the amount of each draft paid by the Issuing Lender 
thereunder. Each L/C Lender agrees with the Issuing Lender that, if a draft 
is paid under any Letter of Credit for which the Issuing Lender is not 
reimbursed in full by the Borrower pursuant to Section 3.5(a), such L/C 
Lender shall pay to the Issuing Lender upon demand at the Issuing Lender’s 
address for notices specified herein an amount equal to such L/C Lender’s 
L/C Percentage of the amount of such draft, or any part thereof, that is 
not so reimbursed. Each L/C Lender’s obligation to pay such amount shall be 
absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, 
including (i) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right 
that such L/C Lender may have against the Issuing Lender, the Borrower or 
any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (ii) the occurrence of a 
Default or an Event of Default or the failure to satisfy any of the other 
conditions specified in Section 5.2, (iii) any adverse change in the 
condition (financial or otherwise) of the Borrower, (iv) any breach of this 
Agreement or any other Loan Document by the Borrower, any other Loan Party 
or any other L/C Lender, or (v) any other circumstance, happening or event 
whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing.
 
(b) Existing Letters of Credit. On and after the Closing Date, each 
Existing Letter of Credit shall be deemed for all purposes, including for 
purposes of the fees to be collected pursuant to Sections 3.3(a) and (b), 
reimbursement of costs and expenses to the extent provided herein and for 
purposes of being secured by the Collateral, a Letter of Credit outstanding 
under this Agreement and entitled to the benefits of this Agreement and the 
other Loan Documents, and shall be governed by the applications and 
agreements pertaining thereto and by this Agreement (which shall control in 
the event of a conflict).
 
3.5 Reimbursement.
 
(a) If the Issuing Lender shall make any L/C Disbursement in respect of a 
Letter of Credit, the Issuing Lender shall notify the Borrower and the 
Administrative Agent thereof and the Borrower shall pay or cause to be paid 
to the Issuing Lender an amount equal to the entire amount of such L/C 
Disbursement not later than (i) the immediately following Business Day if 
the Issuing Lender issues such notice before 10:00 a.m. Pacific time on the 
date of such L/C Disbursement, or (ii) on the

65


second following Business Day if the Issuing Lender issues such notice at 
or after 10:00 a.m. Pacific time on the date of such L/C Disbursement. Each 
such payment shall be made to the Issuing Lender at its address for notices 
referred to herein in Dollars and in immediately available funds.
 
(b) If the Issuing Lender shall not have received from the Borrower the 
payment that it is required to make pursuant to Section 3.5(a) with respect 
to a Letter of Credit within the time specified in such Section, the 
Issuing Lender will promptly notify the Administrative Agent of the L/C 
Disbursement and the Administrative Agent will promptly notify each L/C 
Lender of such L/C Disbursement and its L/C Percentage thereof, and each 
L/C Lender shall pay to the Issuing Lender upon demand at the Issuing 
Lender’s address for notices specified herein an amount equal to such L/C 
Lender’s L/C Percentage of such L/C Disbursement (and the Administrative 
Agent may apply Cash Collateral provided for this purpose) and upon such 
payment pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Lender for any 
L/C Disbursement, the Borrower shall be required to reimburse the L/C 
Lenders for such payments (including interest accrued thereon from the date 
of such payment until the date of such reimbursement at the rate applicable 
to Revolving Loans that are ABR Loans plus 2% per annum) on demand; 
provided that if at the time of and after giving effect to such payment by 
the L/C Lenders, the conditions to borrowings and Revolving Loan 
Conversions set forth in Section 5.2 are satisfied, the Borrower may, by 
written notice to the Administrative Agent certifying that such conditions 
are satisfied and that all interest owing under this paragraph has been 
paid, request that such payments by the L/C Lenders be converted into 
Revolving Loans (a “Revolving Loan Conversion”), in which case, if such 
conditions are in fact satisfied, the L/C Lenders shall be deemed to have 
extended, and the Borrower shall be deemed to have accepted, a Revolving 
Loan in the aggregate principal amount of such payment without further 
action on the part of any party, and the Total L/C Commitments shall be 
permanently reduced by such amount; any amount so paid pursuant to this 
paragraph shall, on and after the payment date thereof, be deemed to be 
Revolving Loans for all purposes hereunder; provided that the Issuing 
Lender, at its option, may effectuate a Revolving Loan Conversion 
regardless of whether the conditions to borrowings and Revolving Loan 
Conversions set forth in Section 5.2 are satisfied.
 
3.6 Obligations Absolute. The Borrower’s obligations under this Section 3 
shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances and 
irrespective of any setoff, counterclaim or defense to payment that the 
Borrower may have or have had against the Issuing Lender, any Lender, any 
beneficiary of a Letter of Credit or any other Person. The Borrower also 
agrees with the Issuing Lender and each Lender that the Issuing Lender and 
each Lender shall not be responsible for, and the Borrower’s obligations 
hereunder shall not be affected by, among other things, the validity or 
genuineness of documents or of any endorsements thereon, even though such 
documents shall in fact prove to be invalid, fraudulent or forged, or any 
dispute between or among the Borrower and any beneficiary of any Letter of 
Credit or any other party to which such Letter of Credit may be transferred 
or any claims whatsoever of the Borrower against any beneficiary of such 
Letter of Credit or any such transferee. The Issuing Lender and each Lender 
shall not be liable for any error, omission, interruption or delay in 
transmission, dispatch or delivery of any message or advice, however 
transmitted, in connection with any Letter of Credit, except for errors or 
omissions found by a final and nonappealable decision of a court of 
competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross negligence or 
willful misconduct of the Issuing Lender or any Lender. The Borrower agrees 
that any action taken or omitted by the Issuing Lender or any Lender under 
or in connection with any Letter of Credit or the related drafts or 
documents, if done in the absence of gross negligence or willful 
misconduct, shall be binding on the Borrower and shall not result in any 
liability of the Issuing Lender and Lender to the Borrower.
 
In addition to amounts payable as elsewhere provided in the Agreement, the 
Borrower hereby agrees to pay and to protect, indemnify, and save Issuing 
Lender and each Lender harmless from and against any and all claims, 
demands, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, charges and expenses

66


(including reasonable attorneys’ fees and allocated costs of internal 
counsel) that the Issuing Lender or any Lender may incur or be subject to 
as a consequence, direct or indirect, of (A) the issuance of any Letter of 
Credit, or (B) the failure of Issuing Lender or of any L/C Lender to honor 
a demand for payment under any Letter of Credit thereof as a result of any 
act or omission, whether rightful or wrongful, of any present or future de 
jure or de facto government or Governmental Authority, in each case other 
than to the extent solely as a result of the gross negligence or willful 
misconduct of Issuing Lender or such L/C Lender (as finally determined by a 
court of competent jurisdiction).
 
3.7 Letter of Credit Payments. If any draft shall be presented for payment 
under any Letter of Credit, the Issuing Lender shall promptly notify the 
Borrower and the Administrative Agent of the date and amount thereof. The 
responsibility of the Issuing Lender to the Borrower in connection with any 
draft presented for payment under any Letter of Credit shall, in addition 
to any payment obligation expressly provided for in such Letter of Credit, 
be limited to determining that the documents (including each draft) 
delivered under such Letter of Credit in connection with such presentment 
are substantially in conformity with such Letter of Credit.
 
3.8 Applications. To the extent that any provision of any Application 
related to any Letter of Credit is inconsistent with the provisions of this 
Section 3, the provisions of this Section 3 shall apply.
 
3.9 Interim Interest. If the Issuing Lender shall make any L/C Disbursement 
in respect of a Letter of Credit, then, unless either the Borrower shall 
have reimbursed such L/C Disbursement in full within the time period 
specified in Section 3.5(a) or the L/C Lenders shall have reimbursed such 
L/C Disbursement in full on such date as provided in Section 3.5(b), in 
each case the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest for the account of 
the Issuing Lender, for each day from and including the date of such L/C 
Disbursement to but excluding the date of payment by the Borrower, at the 
rate per annum that would apply to such amount if such amount were a 
Revolving Loan that is an ABR Loan; provided that the provisions of 
Section 2.15(c) shall be applicable to any such amounts not paid when due.
 
3.10 Cash Collateral.
 
(a) Certain Credit Support Events. Upon the request of the Administrative 
Agent or the Issuing Lender (i) if the Issuing Lender has honored any full 
or partial drawing request under any Letter of Credit and such drawing has 
resulted in an L/C Advance by all the L/C Lenders that is not reimbursed by 
the Borrower or converted into a Revolving Loan pursuant to Section 3.5(b)
, or (ii) if, as of the Letter of Credit Maturity Date, any L/C Exposure 
for any reason remains outstanding, the Borrower shall, in each case, 
immediately Cash Collateralize the then effective L/C Exposure in an amount 
equal to 105% of such L/C Exposure.
 
At any time that there shall exist a Defaulting Lender, within one (1) 
Business Day following the request of the Administrative Agent or the 
Issuing Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower 
shall deliver to the Administrative Agent Cash Collateral in an amount 
sufficient to cover 105% of the Fronting Exposure relating to the Letters 
of Credit (after giving effect to Section 2.24(a)(iv) and any Cash 
Collateral provided by such Defaulting Lender).
 
(b) Grant of Security Interest. All Cash Collateral (other than credit 
support not constituting funds subject to deposit) shall be maintained in 
blocked, non-interest bearing deposit accounts with the Administrative 
Agent. The Borrower, and to the extent provided by any Lender or Defaulting 
Lender, such Lender or Defaulting Lender, hereby grants to (and subjects to 
the control of) the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the 
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender and the L/C Lenders, and agrees to 
maintain, a first priority security interest and Lien in all such Cash 
Collateral and in all proceeds thereof, as security for the Obligations to 
which such Cash Collateral may be applied

67


pursuant to Section 3.10(c). If at any time the Administrative Agent 
determines that Cash Collateral is subject to any right or claim of any 
Person other than the Administrative Agent or any Issuing Lender as herein 
provided, or that the total amount of such Cash Collateral is less than 
105% of the applicable L/C Exposure, Fronting Exposure and other 
Obligations secured thereby, the Borrower or the relevant Lender or 
Defaulting Lender, as applicable, will, promptly upon demand by the 
Administrative Agent, pay or provide to the Administrative Agent additional 
Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to eliminate such deficiency (after 
giving effect to any Cash Collateral provided by such Defaulting Lender).
 
(c) Application. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this 
Agreement, Cash Collateral provided under any of this Section 3.10, 
Section 2.24 or otherwise in respect of Letters of Credit shall be held and 
applied to the satisfaction of the specific L/C Exposure, obligations to 
fund participations therein (including, as to Cash Collateral provided by a 
Defaulting Lender, any interest accrued on such obligation) and other 
obligations for which the Cash Collateral was so provided, prior to any 
other application of such property as may otherwise be provided for herein.
 
(d) Termination of Requirement. Cash Collateral (or the appropriate portion 
thereof) provided to reduce Fronting Exposure in respect of Letters of 
Credit or other Obligations shall no longer be required to be held as Cash 
Collateral pursuant to this Section 3.10 following (i) the elimination of 
the applicable Fronting Exposure and other Obligations giving rise thereto 
(including by the termination of the Defaulting Lender status of the 
applicable Lender), or (ii) a determination by the Administrative Agent and 
the Issuing Lender that there exists excess Cash Collateral; provided, 
however, (A) that Cash Collateral furnished by or on behalf of a Loan Party 
shall not be released during the continuance of an Event of Default, and 
(B) that, subject to Section 2.24, the Person providing such Cash 
Collateral and the Issuing Lender may agree that such Cash Collateral shall 
not be released but instead shall be held to support future anticipated 
Fronting Exposure or other obligations, and provided further, that to the 
extent that such Cash Collateral was provided by the Borrower or any other 
Loan Party, such Cash Collateral shall remain subject to any security 
interest and Lien granted pursuant to the Loan Documents.
 
3.11 [Reserved].
 
3.12 Resignation of the Issuing Lender. The Issuing Lender may resign at 
any time by giving at least 30 days’ prior written notice to the 
Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Borrower. Subject to the next 
succeeding paragraph, upon the acceptance of any appointment as the Issuing 
Lender hereunder by a Lender that shall agree to serve as successor Issuing 
Lender, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the 
interests, rights and obligations of the retiring Issuing Lender and the 
retiring Issuing Lender shall be discharged from its obligations to issue 
additional Letters of Credit hereunder without affecting its rights and 
obligations with respect to Letters of Credit previously issued by it. At 
the time such resignation shall become effective, the Borrower shall pay 
all accrued and unpaid fees pursuant to Section 3.3. The acceptance of any 
appointment as the Issuing Lender hereunder by a successor Lender shall be 
evidenced by an agreement entered into by such successor, in a form 
satisfactory to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, and, from and 
after the effective date of such agreement, (i) such successor Lender shall 
have all the rights and obligations of the previous Issuing Lender under 
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents (other than with respect to the 
rights of the retiring Issuing Lender with respect to Letters of Credit 
issued by such retiring Issuing Lender) and (ii) references herein and in 
the other Loan Documents to the term “Issuing Lender” shall be deemed to 
refer to such successor or to any previous Issuing Lender, or to such 
successor and all previous Issuing Lenders, as the context shall require. 
After the resignation of the Issuing Lender hereunder, the retiring Issuing 
Lender shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the 
rights and obligations of an

68


Issuing Lender under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents with 
respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such resignation, but 
shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit or to extend, 
renew or increase any existing Letter of Credit.
 
3.13 Applicability of ISP. Unless otherwise expressly agreed by the Issuing 
Lender and the Borrower when a Letter of Credit is issued (including 
pursuant to any such agreement applicable to any Existing Letter of Credit) 
and subject to applicable laws, the Letters of Credit shall be governed by 
and subject to the rules of the ISP.
 
SECTION 4
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
 
To induce the Administrative Agent and the Lenders to enter into this 
Agreement, to make the initial Loans on or about the Closing Date and to 
make Loans and to issue the Letters of Credit thereafter, the Borrower 
hereby represents and warrants to the Administrative Agent and each Lender, 
as to itself, each of its respective Subsidiaries and each other Loan 
Party, as applicable, that:
 
4.1 Financial Condition.
 
(a) The Pro Forma Financial Statements have been prepared giving effect (as 
if such events had occurred on such date) to (i) the consummation of the DD 
Acquisition, (ii) the Loans to be made on or about the Closing Date and the 
use of proceeds thereof, and (iii) the payment of fees and expenses in 
connection with the foregoing. The Pro Forma Financial Statements have been 
prepared based on the best information available to the Borrower as of the 
date of delivery thereof, and present fairly in all material respects on a 
pro forma basis the estimated financial position of EDH and its 
consolidated Subsidiaries as of June 30, 2014 assuming that the events 
specified in the preceding sentence had actually occurred at such date.
 
(b) The audited consolidated balance sheets of EDH and its Subsidiaries as 
of December 31, 2011, December 31, 2012, and December 31, 2013, and the 
related consolidated statements of income and of cash flows for the fiscal 
years ended on such dates, reported on by and accompanied by an unqualified 
report from Ernst & Young, present fairly in all material respects the 
consolidated financial condition of EDH and its Subsidiaries as at such 
date, and the consolidated results of its operations and its consolidated 
cash flows for the respective fiscal years then ended. The audited 
consolidated balance sheets of DD and its Subsidiaries as of December 31, 
2013, and the related consolidated statements of income and of cash flows 
for the fiscal years ended on such dates, reported on by and accompanied by 
an unqualified report from KPMG LLP, present fairly the consolidated 
financial condition of DD and its Subsidiaries as at such date, and the 
consolidated results of its operations and its consolidated cash flows for 
the fiscal year then ended, except to the extent that any misstatement or 
inaccuracy in such financial statements materially misrepresents the 
financial condition of DD and such misrepresentation is materially adverse 
to the Lenders. All such financial statements, including the related 
schedules and notes thereto, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP 
applied consistently throughout the periods involved (except as approved by 
the aforementioned firm of accountants and disclosed therein). The 
unaudited consolidated balance sheets of EDH and its Subsidiaries as at 
March 31, 2014, and June 30, 2014, and the related unaudited consolidated 
statements of income and cash flows for the three-month periods ended on 
such dates, present fairly in all material respects the consolidated 
financial condition of EDH and its Subsidiaries as at such dates, and the 
consolidated results of its operations and its consolidated cash flows for 
the three-month periods then ended (subject to normal year-end audit 
adjustments). The unaudited consolidated balance sheet of DD and its 
Subsidiaries as at June 30, 2014 and the related unaudited consolidated 
statement of income and cash flows for the six-month period ended on such 
date, present fairly in all respects the

69


consolidated financial condition of DD and its Subsidiaries as at such 
date, and the consolidated results of its operations and its consolidated 
cash flows for the six-month period then ended (subject to normal year-end 
audit adjustments), except to the extent that any misstatement or 
inaccuracy in such financial statements materially misrepresents the 
financial condition of DD and such misrepresentation is materially adverse 
to the Lenders. No Group Member has, as of the Closing Date, any material 
Guarantee Obligations, contingent liabilities and liabilities for taxes, or 
any long-term leases or unusual forward or long-term commitments, including 
any interest rate or foreign currency swap or exchange transaction or other 
obligation in respect of derivatives, that are not reflected in the most 
recent financial statements referred to in this paragraph. During the 
period from January 1, 2014 to and including the date hereof, other than 
the DD Acquisition, there has been no Disposition by any Group Member of 
any material part of its business or property.
 
4.2 No Change. Since December 31, 2013, there has been no development or 
event that has had or could reasonably be expected to have a Material 
Adverse Effect.
 
4.3 Existence; Compliance with Law. Each Group Member (a) is duly 
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the 
jurisdiction of its organization, (b) has the power and authority, and the 
legal right, to own and operate its property, to lease the property it 
operates as lessee and to conduct the business in which it is currently 
engaged, (c) is duly qualified as a foreign corporation or other 
organization and in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction where 
the failure to be so qualified could reasonably be expected to have a 
Material Adverse Effect and (d) is in material compliance with all 
Requirements of Law except in such instances in which (i) such Requirement 
of Law is being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings 
diligently conducted and the prosecution of such contest would not 
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, or (ii) the 
failure to comply therewith, either individually or in the aggregate, would 
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
 
4.4 Power, Authorization; Enforceable Obligations. Each Loan Party has the 
power and authority, and the legal right, to make, deliver and perform the 
Loan Documents to which it is a party and, in the case of the Borrower, to 
obtain extensions of credit hereunder. Each Loan Party has taken all 
necessary organizational action to authorize the execution, delivery and 
performance of the Loan Documents to which it is a party and, in the case 
of the Borrower, to authorize the extensions of credit on the terms and 
conditions of this Agreement. No Governmental Approval or consent or 
authorization of, filing with, notice to or other act by or in respect of, 
any other Person is required in connection with the DD Acquisition, the 
extensions of credit hereunder or with the execution, delivery, 
performance, validity or enforceability of this Agreement or any of the 
Loan Documents, except (i) Governmental Approvals, consents, 
authorizations, filings and notices described in Schedule 4.4, which 
Governmental Approvals, consents, authorizations, filings and notices have 
been obtained or made and are in full force and effect, (ii) the filings 
referred to in Section 4.19 and (iii) Governmental Approvals described in 
Schedule 4.4. Each Loan Document has been duly executed and delivered on 
behalf of each Loan Party party thereto. This Agreement constitutes, and 
each other Loan Document upon execution will constitute, a legal, valid and 
binding obligation of each Loan Party party thereto, enforceable against 
each such Loan Party in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability 
may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, 
moratorium or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights 
generally and by general equitable principles (whether enforcement is 
sought by proceedings in equity or at law).
 
4.5 No Legal Bar. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement 
and the other Loan Documents, the issuance of Letters of Credit, the 
borrowings hereunder and the use of the proceeds thereof will not violate 
any material Requirement of Law (except as set forth in Schedule 4.5 but 
including any Operating Document of any Group Member) or any material 
Contractual Obligation of any Group Member and will not result in, or 
require, the creation or imposition of any Lien on any of their

70


respective properties or revenues pursuant to any material Requirement of 
Law or any such material Contractual Obligation (other than the Liens 
created by the Security Documents). No Requirement of Law or Contractual 
Obligation applicable to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries could 
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The absence of 
obtaining the Governmental Approvals described in Schedule 4.4 and the 
violations of Requirements of Law referenced in Schedule 4.5 shall not have 
an adverse effect on any rights of the Lenders or the Administrative Agent 
pursuant to the Loan Documents or an adverse effect on the Group Members 
with regard to their continuing operations as expected to result from the 
DD Acquisition.
 
4.6 Litigation. No litigation, investigation or proceeding of or before any 
arbitrator or Governmental Authority is pending or, to the knowledge of the 
Borrower, threatened by or against any Group Member or against any of their 
respective properties or revenues (a) with respect to any of the Loan 
Documents or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, or (b) 
that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
 
4.7 No Default. No Group Member is in default under or with respect to any 
of its Contractual Obligations in any respect that could reasonably be 
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. No Default or Event of Default 
has occurred and is continuing, nor shall either result from the making of 
a requested credit extension.
 
4.8 Ownership of Property; Liens; Investments. Each Group Member has title 
in fee simple to, or a valid leasehold interest in, all of its real 
property, and good title to, or a valid leasehold interest in, all of its 
other property, and none of such property is subject to any Lien except as 
permitted by Section 7.3. No Loan Party owns any Investment except as 
permitted by Section 7.8. Section 10 of the Collateral Information 
Certificate sets forth a complete and accurate list of all real property 
owned by each Loan Party as of the Closing Date, if any. Section 11 of the 
Collateral Information Certificate sets forth a complete and accurate list 
of all leases of real property under which any Loan Party is the lessee as 
of the Closing Date.
 
4.9 Intellectual Property. Each Group Member owns, or is licensed to use, 
all Intellectual Property necessary for the conduct of its business as 
currently conducted. No claim has been asserted and is pending by any 
Person challenging or questioning any Group Member’s use of any 
Intellectual Property or the validity or effectiveness of any such Group 
Member’s Intellectual Property, nor does the Borrower know of any valid 
basis for any such claim, unless such claim could not reasonably be 
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. To the knowledge of the Loan 
Parties, the use of Intellectual Property by each Group Member, and the 
conduct of such Group Member’s business, as currently conducted, does not 
infringe on or otherwise violate the rights of any Person, unless such 
infringement could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse 
Effect, and there are no claims pending or, to the knowledge of the 
Borrower, threatened to such effect.
 
4.10 Taxes. Each Group Member has filed or caused to be filed all Federal, 
all income and all other material state and other tax returns that are 
required to be filed and has paid all material taxes shown to be due and 
payable on said returns or on any assessments made against it or any of its 
property and all other material taxes, fees or other charges imposed on it 
or any of its property by any Governmental Authority (other than any the 
amount or validity of which are currently being contested in good faith by 
appropriate proceedings and with respect to which reserves in conformity 
with GAAP have been provided on the books of the relevant Group Member); no 
tax Lien has been filed (other than Liens permitted by Section 7.3(a)); 
and, to the knowledge of the Borrower, no material claim is being asserted, 
with respect to any such tax, fee or other charge.

71


4.11 Federal Regulations. No part of the proceeds of any Loans, and no 
other extensions of credit hereunder, will be used (a) for “buying” or 
“carrying” any “margin stock” within the respective meanings of each of the 
quoted terms under Regulation U as now and from time to time hereafter in 
effect for any purpose that violates the provisions of the Regulations of 
the Board or (b) for any purpose that violates the provisions of the 
Regulations of the Board. If requested by any Lender or the Administrative

Regulation U.

liability on the books of the relevant Group Member.

Affiliates knows of any facts or circumstances that could reasonably be 
expected to cause the funding target attainment percentage to fall below 
60% as of the most recent valuation date;

of outstanding benefit liabilities (as defined in Section 4001(a)(18) of 
ERISA), individually or in the aggregate for all Pension Plans (excluding 
for purposes of such computation any Pension Plans with respect to which 
assets exceed benefit liabilities), does not exceed $100,000;
 
(f) the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of 
the transactions contemplated hereunder will not involve any transaction

(b) no Group Member has received or is aware of any notice of violation,

Document or any other document, certificate or statement furnished by or on 
behalf of any Loan Party to the Administrative Agent or the Lenders, or any 
of them, for use in connection with the transactions contemplated by this 
Agreement or the other Loan Documents, contained as of the date such 
statement, information, document or certificate was so furnished, any 
untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact 
necessary to make the statements contained herein or therein not misleading 
in any material respect. The projections and pro forma financial 
information contained in the materials referenced above are based upon good 
faith estimates and assumptions believed by the Borrower to be reasonable 
at the time made, it being recognized by the Lenders that such financial 
information as it relates to future events is not to be viewed as fact and 
that actual results during the period or periods covered by such financial 
information may differ from the projected results set forth therein by a 
material amount. As of the date hereof, (i) the representations and 
warranties contained in the DD Acquisition Documentation, in the case of 
EDH, are, and in the case of any other Person, are to the knowledge of EDH, 
true and correct in all material respects (except to the extent qualified 
by materiality in the text thereof in which case they shall be true and 
correct in all respects), and (ii) all conditions to the consummation of 
the DD Acquisition set forth in the DD Acquisition Documentation have been 
satisfied, except, in the case of this clause (ii), as would not be adverse 
to any Group Member or the interests of the Administrative Agent or the 
Lenders, except as agreed by the Administrative Agent. There is no fact 
known to any Loan Party that could reasonably be expected to have a 
Material Adverse Effect that has not been expressly disclosed herein, in 
the other Loan Documents or in any other documents, certificates and 
statements furnished to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders for use in 
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and by the other Loan

enforceable Lien on the Mortgaged Properties described therein and proceeds 
thereof, and when the Mortgages are filed in the offices for the applicable 
jurisdictions in which the Mortgaged Properties are located, each such 
Mortgage shall constitute a fully perfected Lien on, and security interest 
in, all right, title and interest of the Loan Parties in the Mortgaged

such risks (but including in any event public liability, product liability 
and business interruption) as are usually insured against in the same 
general area by companies engaged in the same or a similar business.

(iii) any court order enjoins, restrains or prevents a Loan Party from 
conducting all or any material part of its business; or
 
(j) the guarantee contained in Section 2 of the Guarantee and Collateral 
Agreement shall cease, for any reason, to be in full force and effect or 
any Loan Party shall so assert; or
 
(k) a Change of Control shall occur; or
 
(l) any of the Governmental Approvals shall have been (i) revoked, 
rescinded, suspended, modified in an adverse manner or not renewed in the 
ordinary course for a full term or (ii) subject to any decision by a 
Governmental Authority that designates a hearing with respect to any 
applications for renewal of any of the Governmental Approvals or that could 
result in the Governmental Authority taking any of the actions described in 
clause (i) above, and such decision or such revocation, rescission, 
suspension, modification or nonrenewal (A) has, or could reasonably be 
expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect, or (B) materially adversely 
affects the legal qualifications of any Group Member to hold any material 
Governmental Approval in any applicable jurisdiction and such revocation, 
rescission, suspension, modification or nonrenewal could reasonably be 
expected to materially adversely affect the status of or legal 
qualifications of any Group Member to hold any material Governmental 
Approval in any other jurisdiction; or
 
(m) Any Loan Document not otherwise referenced in Section 8.1(i) or (j), at 
any time after its execution and delivery and for any reason other than as 
expressly permitted hereunder or thereunder or the Discharge of 
Obligations, ceases to be in full force and effect; or any Loan Party or 
any other Person contests in any manner the validity or enforceability of 
any Loan Document; or any Loan Party denies that it has any or any further 
liability or obligation under any Loan Document to which it is a party, or 
purports to revoke, terminate or rescind any such Loan Document.
 
8.2 Remedies upon Event of Default. If any Event of Default occurs and is 
continuing, the Administrative Agent shall, at the request of, or may, with 
the consent of, the Required Lenders, take any or all of the following 
actions:

104


(a) if such event is an Event of Default specified in clause (i) or (ii) of 
paragraph (f) of Section 8.1 with respect to the Borrower, the Commitments 
shall immediately terminate automatically and the Loans (with accrued 
interest thereon) and all other amounts owing under this Agreement and the 
other Loan Documents shall automatically immediately become due and 
payable, and
 
(b) if such event is any other Event of Default, any of the following 
actions may be taken: (i) with the consent of the Required Lenders, the 
Administrative Agent may, or upon the request of the Required Lenders, the 
Administrative Agent shall, by notice to the Borrower declare the Revolving 
Commitments, the Term Commitments, the Swingline Commitments and the L/C 
Commitments to be terminated forthwith, whereupon the Revolving 
Commitments, the Term Commitments, the Swingline Commitments and the L/C 
Commitments shall immediately terminate; (ii) with the consent of the 
Required Lenders, the Administrative Agent may, or upon the request of the 
Required Lenders, the Administrative Agent shall, by notice to the 
Borrower, declare the Loans (with accrued interest thereon) and all other 
amounts owing under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to be due 
and payable forthwith, whereupon the same shall immediately become due and 
payable; (iii) any Bank Services Provider may terminate any foreign 
exchange service agreements or other Bank Services Agreement then 
outstanding; and (iv) exercise on behalf of itself, the Lenders and the 
Issuing Lender all rights and remedies available to it, the Lenders and the 
Issuing Lender under the Loan Documents. With respect to all Letters of 
Credit with respect to which presentment for honor shall not have occurred 
at the time of an acceleration pursuant to this paragraph, the Borrower 
shall Cash Collateralize an amount equal to 105% of the aggregate then 
undrawn and unexpired amount of such Letters of Credit. Amounts so Cash 
Collateralized shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to the payment 
of drafts drawn under such Letters of Credit, and the unused portion 
thereof after all such Letters of Credit shall have expired or been fully 
drawn upon, if any, shall be applied to repay other Obligations of the 
Borrower hereunder and under the other Loan Documents in accordance with 
Section 8.3. In addition, (x) the Borrower shall also Cash Collateralize 
the full amount of any Swingline Loans then outstanding, and (y) to the 
extent elected by the applicable Bank Services Provider, the Borrower shall 
also Cash Collateralize the amount of any Obligations in respect of Bank 
Services then outstanding. After all such Letters of Credit and Bank 
Services Agreements shall have been terminated, expired or fully drawn 
upon, as applicable, and all amounts drawn under any such Letters of Credit 
shall have been reimbursed in full and all other Obligations of the 
Borrower and the other Loan Parties (including any such Obligations arising 
in connection with Bank Services) shall have been paid in full, the 
balance, if any, of the funds having been so Cash Collateralized shall be 
returned to the Borrower (or such other Person as may be lawfully entitled 
thereto). Except as expressly provided above in this Section, presentment, 
demand, protest and all other notices of any kind are hereby expressly 
waived by the Borrower.
 
8.3 Application of Funds. After the exercise of remedies provided for in 
Section 8.2, any amounts received by the Administrative Agent on account of 
the Obligations shall be applied by the Administrative Agent in the 
following order:
 
First, to the payment of that portion of the Obligations constituting fees, 
indemnities, expenses and other amounts (other than principal and interest 
but including any Collateral-Related Expenses, fees, charges and 
disbursements of counsel to the Administrative Agent and amounts payable 
under Sections 2.19, 2.20 and 2.21) payable to the Administrative Agent in 
its capacity as such (including interest thereon);
 
Second, to payment of that portion of the Obligations constituting fees, 
indemnities and other amounts (other than principal, interest and Letter of 
Credit Fees) payable to the Lenders, the Issuing Lender (including any 
Letter of Credit Fronting Fees, Issuing Lender Fees and the reasonable 
fees,

105


charges and disbursements of counsel to the respective Lenders and the 
Issuing Lender and amounts payable under Sections 2.19, 2.20 and 2.21), in 
each case, ratably among them in proportion to the respective amounts 
described in this clause Second payable to them;
 
Third, to payment of that portion of the Obligations constituting accrued 
and unpaid Letter of Credit Fees and interest on the Loans and L/C 
Disbursements which have not yet been converted into Revolving Loans, in 
each case, ratably among the Lenders and the Issuing Lender, in each case, 
ratably among them in proportion to the respective amounts described in 
this clause Third payable to them;
 
Fourth, to payment of that portion of the Obligations constituting unpaid 
principal of the Loans and L/C Disbursements which have not yet been 
converted into Revolving Loans, in each case, ratably among them in 
proportion to the respective amounts described in this clause Fourth held 
by them;
 
Fifth, to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender, 
to Cash Collateralize that portion of the L/C Exposure comprised of the 
aggregate undrawn amount of Letters of Credit pursuant to Section 3.10;
 
Sixth, if so elected by the applicable Bank Services Provider and/or 
Qualified Counterparty, to the Administrative Agent for the account of each 
Bank Services Provider and Qualified Counterparty, to repay or Cash 
Collateralize then-outstanding Obligations arising in connection with Bank 
Services and Specified Swap Agreements;
 
Seventh, to the payment of all other Obligations of the Loan Parties that 
are then due and payable to the Administrative Agent and the other Secured 
Parties on such date, in each case, ratably among them in proportion to the 
respective aggregate amounts of all such Obligations owing to the 
Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties on such date; and
 
Last, the balance, if any, after all of the Obligations have been 
indefeasibly paid in full (excluding, for this purpose, any Obligations 
which have been Cash Collateralized in accordance with the terms hereof), 
to the Borrower or as otherwise required by Law.
 
Subject to Sections 2.24(a), 3.4, 3.5 and 3.10, amounts used to Cash 
Collateralize the aggregate undrawn amount of Letters of Credit pursuant to 
clause Fifth above shall be applied to satisfy drawings under such Letters 
of Credit as they occur. If any amount remains on deposit as Cash 
Collateral for Letters of Credit after all Letters of Credit have either 
been fully drawn or expired, such remaining amount shall be applied to the 
other Obligations, if any, in the order set forth above.
 
SECTION 9
THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT
 
9.1 Appointment and Authority.
 
(a) Each of the Lenders hereby irrevocably appoints SVB to act on its 
behalf as the Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan 
Documents and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on 
its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the 
Administrative Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together with such 
actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.
 
(b) The provisions of Section 9 are solely for the benefit of the 
Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Issuing Lender, and neither the 
Borrower nor any other Loan Party shall

106


have rights as a third party beneficiary of any of such provisions. 
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, 
the Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities to 
any Lender or any other Person, except those expressly set forth herein, or 
any fiduciary relationship with any Lender, and no implied covenants, 
functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be 
read into this Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise exist 
against the Administrative Agent. It is understood and agreed that the use 
of the term “agent” herein or in any other Loan Documents (or any other 
similar term) with reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to 
connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising 
under agency doctrine of any applicable law. Instead such term is used as a 
matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an 
administrative relationship between contracting parties.
 
(c) The Administrative Agent shall also act as the collateral agent under 
the Loan Documents, and the Issuing Lender and each of the other Lenders 
(in their respective capacities as a Lender and, as applicable, Qualified 
Counterparty or provider of Bank Services) hereby irrevocably (i) authorize 
the Administrative Agent to enter into all other Loan Documents, as 
applicable, including the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement, any 
subordination agreements and any other Security Documents, and (ii) appoint 
and authorize the Administrative Agent to act as the agent of the Secured 
Parties for purposes of acquiring, holding and enforcing any and all Liens 
on Collateral granted by any of the Loan Parties to secure any of the 
Obligations, together with such powers and discretion as are reasonably 
incidental thereto. The Administrative Agent, as collateral agent and any 
co-agents, sub-agents and attorneys-in-fact appointed by the Administrative 
Agent pursuant to Section 9.2 for purposes of holding or enforcing any Lien 
on the Collateral (or any portion thereof) granted under the Security 
Documents, or for exercising any rights and remedies thereunder at the 
direction of the Administrative Agent), shall be entitled to the benefits 
of all provisions of this Section 9 and Section 10 (including Section 9.7, 
as though such co-agents, sub-agents and attorneys-in-fact were the 
collateral agent under the Loan Documents) as if set forth in full herein 
with respect thereto. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the 
Administrative Agent is further authorized on behalf of all the Lenders, 
without the necessity of any notice to or further consent from the Lenders, 
from time to time to take any action, or permit any co-agents, sub-agents 
and attorneys-in-fact appointed by the Administrative Agent to take any 
action, with respect to any Collateral or the Loan Documents which may be 
necessary to perfect and maintain perfected the Liens upon any Collateral 
granted pursuant to any Loan Document.
 
9.2 Delegation of Duties. The Administrative Agent may perform any and all 
of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any 
other Loan Document by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by 
the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent 
may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by 
or through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of 
this Section shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties 
of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to 
their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the 
Facilities provided for herein as well as activities as the Administrative 
Agent. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence 
or misconduct of any sub-agents except to the extent that a court of 
competent jurisdiction determines in a final and nonappealable judgment 
that the Administrative Agent acted with gross negligence or willful 
misconduct in the selection of such sub agents.
 
9.3 Exculpatory Provisions. The Administrative Agent shall have no duties 
or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other 
Loan Documents, and its duties hereunder and thereunder shall be 
administrative in nature. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, 
the Administrative Agent shall not:
 
(a) be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of 
whether any Default or any Event of Default has occurred and is continuing;

107


(b) have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any 
discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly 
contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Administrative 
Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required 
Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be 
expressly provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents), as 
applicable; provided that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to 
take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may 
expose the Administrative Agent to liability or that is contrary to any 
Loan Document or applicable law, including for the avoidance of doubt any 
action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any Debtor 
Relief Law or that may effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of 
property of a Defaulting Lender in violation of any Debtor Relief Law; and
 
(c) except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, 
have any duty to disclose, and the Administrative Agent shall not be liable 
for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or 
any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by any Person 
serving as the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any 
capacity.
 
The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not 
taken by it (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders 
(or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, 
or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith shall be 
necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Sections 8.2 and 10.1), 
or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct as 
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable 
judgment.
 
The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to 
ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation 
made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, 
(ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered 
hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the 
performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other 
terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any 
Default or Event of Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, 
effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or 
any other agreement, instrument or document or (v) the satisfaction of any 
condition set forth in Section 5.1, Section 5.2 or elsewhere herein, other 
than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the 
Administrative Agent.
 
9.4 Reliance by Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be 
entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, 
any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document 
or other writing (including any electronic message, internet or intranet 
website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to 
have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person. The 
Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or 
by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and 
shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining 
compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan, or the 
issuance, extension, renewal or increase of a Letter of Credit, that by its 
terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender, the Administrative 
Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender unless 
the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from 
such Lender prior to the making of such Loan or the issuance of such Letter 
of Credit. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may 
be counsel for any of the Loan Parties), independent accountants and other 
experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not 
taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants 
or experts. The Administrative Agent may deem and treat the payee of any 
Note as the owner thereof for all purposes unless a written notice of 
assignment, negotiation or transfer thereof shall have been filed with the 
Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in 
failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement or any other 
Loan Document unless it shall first receive such advice or

108


concurrence of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of 
Lenders as shall be provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents) as 
it deems appropriate or it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction 
by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense that may be 
incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. 
The Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, 
or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement and the other Loan 
Documents in accordance with a request of the Required Lenders (or such 
other number or percentage of Lenders as shall be provided for herein or in 
the other Loan Documents), and such request and any action taken or failure 
to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon the Lenders and all future 
holders of the Loans.
 
9.5 Notice of Default. The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have 
knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default 
unless the Administrative Agent has received notice in writing from a 
Lender or the Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing such Default 
or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a “notice of default.” 
In the event that the Administrative Agent receives such a notice, the 
Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Lenders. The 
Administrative Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or 
Event of Default as shall be reasonably directed by the Required Lenders 
(or, if so specified by this Agreement, all Lenders); provided that unless 
and until the Administrative Agent shall have received such directions, the 
Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action 
or refrain from taking such action with respect to such Default or Event of 
Default as it shall deem advisable in the best interests of the Lenders.
 
9.6 Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent and Other Lenders. Each Lender 
expressly acknowledges that neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its 
officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys in fact or affiliates has 
made any representations or warranties to it and that no act by the 
Administrative Agent hereafter taken, including any review of the affairs 
of a Group Member or any affiliate of a Group Member, shall be deemed to 
constitute any representation or warranty by the Administrative Agent to 
any Lender. Each Lender represents to the Administrative Agent that it has, 
independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any 
other Lender or any of their Related Parties, and based on such documents 
and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and 
investigation into the business, operations, property, financial and other 
condition and creditworthiness of the Group Members and their affiliates 
and made its own credit analysis and decision to make its Loans hereunder 
and enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also agrees that it will, 
independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any 
other Lender or any of their Related Parties, and based on such documents 
and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make 
its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking 
action under or based upon this Agreement, the other Loan Documents or any 
related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder, and to 
make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the 
business, operations, property, financial and other condition and 
creditworthiness of the Group Members and their affiliates. Except for 
notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to 
the Lenders by the Administrative Agent hereunder, the Administrative Agent 
shall have no duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit 
or other information concerning the business, operations, property, 
condition (financial or otherwise), prospects or creditworthiness of any 
Group Member or any Affiliate of a Group Member that may come into the 
possession of the Administrative Agent or any of its officers, directors, 
employees, agents, attorneys in fact or affiliates.
 
9.7 Indemnification. Each of the Lenders agrees to indemnify each of the 
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender and the Swingline Lender and each 
of its Related Parties in its capacity as such (to the extent not 
reimbursed by the Borrower or any other Loan Party pursuant to any Loan 
Document and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower or any other 
Loan Party to do so) according to its Aggregate Exposure Percentage in 
effect on the date on which indemnification is sought under this Section 
9.7 (or, if indemnification is sought after the date upon which the 
Commitments shall have terminated and the Loans shall have been paid in 
full, in accordance with its Aggregate Exposure

109


Percentage immediately prior to such date), from and against any and all 
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, 
suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever that may at 
any time (whether before or after the payment of the Loans) be imposed on, 
incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent or such other 
Person in any way relating to or arising out of, the Commitments, this 
Agreement, any of the other Loan Documents or any documents contemplated by 
or referred to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or 
thereby or any action taken or omitted by the Administrative Agent or such 
other Person under or in connection with any of the foregoing and any other 
amounts not reimbursed by the Borrower or such other Loan Party; provided 
that no Lender shall be liable for the payment of any portion of such 
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, 
suits, costs, expenses or disbursements that are found by a final and 
nonappealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to have 
resulted primarily from the Administrative Agent’s or such other Person’s 
gross negligence or willful misconduct, and that with respect to such 
unpaid amounts owed to the Issuing Lender or the Swingline Lender solely in 
its capacity as such, only the Revolving Lenders shall be required to pay 
such unpaid amounts, such payment to be made severally among them based on 
such Revolving Lenders’ Revolving Percentage (determined as of the time 
that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought). 
The agreements in this Section shall survive the payment of the Loans and 
all other amounts payable hereunder.
 
9.8 Agent in Its Individual Capacity. The Person serving as the 
Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its 
capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as 
though it were not the Administrative Agent and the term “Lender” or 
“Lenders” shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context 
otherwise requires, include the Person serving as the Administrative Agent 
hereunder in its individual capacity. Such Person and its Affiliates may 
accept deposits from, lend money to, own securities of, act as the 
financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally 
engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other 
Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not the Administrative Agent 
hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders.
 
9.9 Successor Administrative Agent.
 
(a) The Administrative Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation 
to the Lenders and the Borrower. Upon receipt of any such notice of 
resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation 
with the Borrower, to appoint a successor. If no such successor shall have 
been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such 
appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives 
notice of its resignation (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the 
Required Lenders) (the “Resignation Effective Date”), then the retiring 
Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to), on behalf of the 
Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent meeting the 
qualifications set forth above. Whether or not a successor has been 
appointed, such resignation shall become effective in accordance with such 
notice on the Resignation Effective Date.
 
(b) If the Person serving as Administrative Agent is a Defaulting Lender 
pursuant to clause (d) of the definition thereof, the Required Lenders may, 
to the extent permitted by applicable law, by notice in writing to the 
Borrower and such Person remove such Person as Administrative Agent and, in 
consultation with the Borrower, appoint a successor. If no such successor 
shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have 
accepted such appointment within 30 days (or such earlier day as shall be 
agreed by the Required Lenders) (the “Removal Effective Date”), then such 
removal shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice 
on the Removal Effective Date.

110


(c) With effect from the Resignation Effective Date or the Removal 
Effective Date (as applicable) (i) the retiring or removed Administrative 
Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and 
under the other Loan Documents (except that in the case of any collateral 
security held by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Secured Parties 
under any of the Loan Documents, the retiring or removed Administrative 
Agent shall continue to hold such collateral security until such time as a 
successor Administrative Agent is appointed and such collateral security is 
assigned to such successor Administrative Agent) and (ii) except for any 
indemnity payments owed to the retiring or removed Administrative Agent, 
all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to 
or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each 
Lender directly, until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a 
successor Administrative Agent as provided for above in this Section. Upon 
the acceptance of a successor’s appointment as Administrative Agent 
hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of 
the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring or removed 
Administrative Agent (other than any rights to indemnity payments owed to 
the retiring or removed Administrative Agent), and the retiring or removed 
Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and 
obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents (if not already 
discharged therefrom as provided above in this Section). The fees payable 
by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as 
those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the 
Borrower and such successor. After the retiring or removed Administrative 
Agent’s resignation or removal hereunder and under the other Loan 
Documents, the provisions of Section 9 and Section 10.5 shall continue in 
effect for the benefit of such retiring or removed Administrative Agent, 
its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any 
actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring or 
removed Administrative Agent was acting as the Administrative Agent.
 
9.10 Collateral and Guaranty Matters. The Lenders irrevocably authorize the 
Administrative Agent, at its option and in its discretion,
 
(a) to release any Lien on any Collateral or other property granted to or 
held by the Administrative Agent under any Loan Document (i) upon the 
Discharge of Obligations (other than contingent indemnification 
obligations) and the expiration or termination of all Letters of Credit, 
Bank Services and Specified Swap Agreements (other than Letters of Credit, 
Bank Services and Specified Swap Agreements the Obligations in respect of 
which have been Cash Collateralized in an amount equal to 105% thereof in 
accordance with the terms hereof or as to which other arrangements 
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender, provider of 
Bank Services or any applicable Qualified Counterparty, as applicable, 
shall have been made), (ii) that is sold or otherwise disposed of or to be 
sold or otherwise disposed of as part of or in connection with any sale or 
other disposition permitted hereunder or under any other Loan Document, or 
(iii) subject to Section 10.1, if approved, authorized or ratified in 
writing by the Required Lenders;
 
(b) to subordinate any Lien on any Collateral or other property granted to 
or held by the Administrative Agent under any Loan Document to the holder 
of any Lien on such property that is permitted by Sections 7.3(g) and (i); 
and
 
(c) to release any Guarantor from its obligations under the Guarantee and 
Collateral Agreement if such Person ceases to be a Subsidiary as a result 
of a transaction permitted under the Loan Documents.
 
(d) Upon request by the Administrative Agent at any time, the Required 
Lenders will confirm in writing the Administrative Agent’s authority to 
release or subordinate its interest in particular types or items of 
property, or to release any Guarantor from its obligations under the 
Guaranty pursuant to this Section 9.10.

111


(e) The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have a duty to 
ascertain or inquire into any representation or warranty regarding the 
existence, value or collectability of the Collateral, the existence, 
priority or perfection of the Administrative Agent’s Lien thereon, or any 
certificate prepared by any Loan Party in connection therewith, nor shall 
the Administrative Agent be responsible or liable to the Lenders for any 
failure to monitor or maintain any portion of the Collateral.
 
(f) No Secured Party shall have any right individually to realize upon any 
of the Collateral or to enforce any Guarantee of the Secured Obligations, 
it being understood and agreed that all powers, rights and remedies under 
the Loan Documents may be exercised solely by the Administrative Agent on 
behalf of the Secured Parties in accordance with the terms thereof; 
provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall a Secured 
Party be restricted hereunder from filing a proof of claim in an Insolvency 
Proceeding. In the event of a foreclosure by the Administrative Agent on 
any of the Collateral pursuant to a public or private sale or other 
disposition, the Administrative Agent or any Secured Party may be the 
purchaser or licensor of any or all of such Collateral at any such sale or 
other disposition, and the Administrative Agent, as agent for and 
representative of the Secured Party (but not any Lender or Lenders in its 
or their respective individual capacities unless the Required Lenders shall 
otherwise agree in writing) shall be entitled, for the purpose of bidding 
and making settlement or payment of the purchase price for all or any 
portion of the Collateral sold at any such public sale, to use and apply 
any of the Secured Obligations as a credit on account of the purchase price 
for any collateral payable by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the 
Secured Parties at such sale or other disposition. Each Secured Party, 
whether or not a party hereto, will be deemed, by its acceptance of the 
benefits of the Collateral and of the Guarantees of the Secured Obligations 
provided under the Loan Documents, to have agreed to the foregoing 
provisions. In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation thereof, 
no Swap Agreement the obligations under which constitute Secured 
Obligations will create (or be deemed to create) in favor of any Secured 
Party that is a party thereto any rights in connection with the management 
or release of any Collateral or of the obligations of any Loan Party under 
any Loan Document except as expressly provided in the Guarantee and 
Collateral Agreement. By accepting the benefits of the Collateral, each 
Secured Party that is a party to any such Hedging Agreement shall be deemed 
to have appointed the Administrative Agent to serve as administrative agent 
and collateral agent under the Loan Documents and agreed to be bound by the 
Loan Documents as a Secured Party thereunder, subject to the limitations 
set forth in this paragraph.
 
9.11 Administrative Agent May File Proofs of Claim. In case of the pendency 
of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or any other judicial 
proceeding relative to any Loan Party, the Administrative Agent 
(irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan or Obligation in respect 
of any Letter of Credit shall then be due and payable as herein expressed 
or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the 
Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on the Borrower) shall be 
entitled and empowered (but not obligated), by intervention in such 
proceeding or otherwise:
 
(a) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and 
interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans, Obligations in respect 
of any Letter of Credit and all other Obligations that are owing and unpaid 
and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable to have 
the claims of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent (including any claim 
for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of 
the Lenders and the Administrative Agent and their respective agents and 
counsel and all other amounts due the Lenders and the Administrative Agent 
under Sections 2.9 and 10.5) allowed in such judicial proceeding; and
 
(b) to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or 
deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;

112


and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or 
other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized 
by each Lender to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in 
the event that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such 
payments directly to the Lenders, to pay to the Administrative Agent any 
amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and 
advances of the Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any 
other amounts due the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.9 and 10.5.
 
Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative 
Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender 
any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition 
affecting the Obligations or the rights of any Lender to authorize the 
Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender in any 
such proceeding.
 
9.12 No Other Duties, Etc.
 
Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, none of the “Bookrunners”, 
“Arrangers”, “Syndication Agent” or “Documentation Agents” listed on the 
cover page hereof shall have any powers, duties or responsibilities under 
this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, except in its capacity, 
as applicable, as the Administrative Agent, a Lender, the Issuing Lender or 
the Swingline Lender hereunder.
 
9.13 Reports and Financial Statements.
 
Each Bank Services Provider agrees to furnish to the Administrative Agent 
at such frequency as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request with a 
summary of all Obligations in respect of Bank Services due or to become due 
to such Bank Services Provider. In connection with any distributions to be 
made hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to assume that 
no amounts are due to any Bank Services Provider unless the Administrative 
Agent has received written notice thereof from such Bank Services Provider 
and if such notice is received, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled 
to assume that the only amounts due to such Bank Services Provider on 
account of Bank Services is the amount set forth in such notice.

Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities 
and related reasonable expenses (including the fees, charges and 
disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee), incurred by any 
Indemnitee or asserted against any Indemnitee by any Person (including the 
Borrower or any other Loan Party) other than such Indemnitee and its

the execution or delivery of this Agreement, any other Loan

to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, 
damages, liabilities or related expenses (x) are determined by a court of 
competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted 
from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee or (y) 
result from a claim brought by the Borrower or any other Loan Party against 
an Indemnitee for breach in bad faith of such Indemnitee’s obligations 
hereunder or under any other Loan Document, if the Borrower or such Loan 
Party has obtained a final and nonappealable judgment in its favor on such 
claim as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction. This Section 
10.5(b) shall not apply with respect to Taxes other than any Taxes that 
represent losses, claims, damages, etc. arising from any non-Tax claim.
 
(c) Reimbursement by Lenders. To the extent that the Borrower or any other 
Loan Party pursuant to any other Loan Document for any reason fails 
indefeasibly to pay any amount required under paragraph (a) or (b) of this 
Section to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent (or any sub-agent 
thereof), the Issuing Lender, the Swingline Lender or any Related Party of 
any of the foregoing, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the 
Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent), the Issuing Lender, the 
Swingline Lender or such Related Party, as the case may be, such Lender’s 
pro rata share (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed 
expense or indemnity payment is sought based on each Lender’s share of the 
Total Credit Exposure at such time) of such unpaid amount (including any 
such unpaid amount in respect of a claim asserted by such Lender); 
provided that with respect to such unpaid amounts owed to the Issuing 
Lender or the Swingline Lender solely in its capacity as such, only the 
Revolving Lenders shall be required to pay such unpaid amounts, such 
payment to be made severally among them based on such Revolving Lenders’ 
Revolving Percentage (determined as of the time that the applicable 
unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) and provided further, 
that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability 
or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against 
the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent), the Issuing Lender or the 
Swingline Lender in its capacity as such, or against any Related Party of 
any of the foregoing acting for the Administrative Agent (or any such 
sub-agent), the Issuing Lender or the Swingline Lender in connection with 
such capacity. The obligations of the Lenders under this paragraph (c) are 
subject to the provisions of Sections 2.1, 2.4 and 2.20(e).
 
(d) Waiver of Consequential Damages, Etc. To the fullest extent permitted 
by applicable law, the Borrower shall not assert, and hereby waives, any 
claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, 
indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual 
damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this 
Agreement, any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument 
contemplated hereby, the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, any 
Loan or Letter of Credit, or the use of the proceeds thereof. No Indemnitee 
referred to in paragraph (b) above shall be liable for any damages arising 
from the use by unintended recipients of any information or other materials 
distributed by it through telecommunications, electronic or other 
information transmission systems in connection with this Agreement or the 
other Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby 
other than for direct or actual damages resulting from

118


the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee as determined 
by a final and nonappealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.
 
(e) Payments. All amounts due under this Section shall be payable promptly 
after demand therefor.
 
(f) Survival. Each party’s obligations under this Section shall survive the 
resignation of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender and the 
Swingline Lender, the replacement of any Lender, the termination of the 
Loan Documents, the termination of the Commitments and the Discharge of 
Obligations.
 
10.6 Successors and Assigns; Participations and Assignments.

hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, 
Participants to the extent provided in paragraph (d) of this Section and, 
to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of 
the Administrative Agent and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, 
remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.
 
(b) Assignments by Lenders. Any Lender may at any time assign to one or 
more Eligible Assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations

any Facility) any such assignment shall be subject to the following 
conditions:
 
(i) Minimum Amounts.

Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the 
Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to 
the Administrative Agent or, if “Trade Date” is specified in the Assignment

the case of any assignment in respect of the Revolving Facility, or 
$2,000,000, in the case of any assignment in respect of the Term Loan 
Facility, unless each of the Administrative Agent and, so

119


long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the 
Borrower otherwise consents (each such consent not to be unreasonably 
withheld or delayed).
 
(ii) Proportionate Amounts. Each partial assignment shall be made as an 
assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender’s rights and 
obligations under this Agreement with respect to the Loans and/or the 
Commitments assigned, except that this clause (ii) shall not prohibit any 
Lender from assigning all or a portion of its rights and obligations among 
separate Facilities on a non-pro rata basis.

to have consented to any such assignment unless it shall object thereto by 
written notice to the Administrative Agent within five Business Days after

(B) the consent of the Administrative Agent (such consent not to be 
unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required for assignments in 
respect of (i) the Revolving Facility or any unfunded Commitments with 
respect to the Term Loan Facility if such assignment is to a Person that is 
not a Lender with a Commitment in respect of such Facility, an Affiliate of 
such Lender or an Approved Fund with respect to such Lender, or (ii) any 
Term Loans to a Person who is not a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an 
Approved Fund; and
 
(C) the consent of the Issuing Lender and the Swingline Lender shall be 
required for any assignment in respect of the Revolving Facility.
 
(iv) Assignment and Assumption. The parties to each assignment shall 
execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and 
Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500; 
provided that the Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion, elect 
to waive such processing and recordation fee in the case of any assignment
. The assignee, if it is not a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative 
Agent any such administrative questionnaire as the Administrative Agent may 
request.
 
(v) No Assignment to Certain Persons. No such assignment shall be made to 
(A) a Loan Party or any of a Loan Party’s Affiliates or Subsidiaries or (B)

Persons described in this clause (B).

a natural Person.
 
(vii) Certain Additional Payments. In connection with any assignment of 
rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such 
assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other 
conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall 
make such additional payments to the Administrative Agent in an aggregate 
amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be 
outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or 
subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including funding, with 
the consent of

120


the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, the applicable pro rata share of 
Loans previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting Lender, to each 
of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), 
to (x) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such 
Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender, the 
Swingline Lender and each other Lender hereunder (and interest accrued 
thereon), and (y) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full pro rata share 
of all Loans and participations in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans in 
accordance with its Revolving Percentage. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in 
the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting 
Lender hereunder shall become effective under applicable law without 
compliance with the provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of such 
interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this 
Agreement until such compliance occurs.
 
Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent 
pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section, from and after the effective 
date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the assignee thereunder 
shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest 
assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations 
of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder 
shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and 
Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in 
the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning 
Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall 
cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be entitled to the 
benefits of Sections 2.19, 2.20, 2.21 and 10.5 with respect to facts and 
circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment; 
provided, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the 
affected parties, no assignment by a Defaulting Lender will constitute a 
waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that 
Lender’s having been a Defaulting Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a 
Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply 
with this paragraph shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a 
sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in 
accordance with paragraph (d) of this Section.
 
(c) Register. The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as 
an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices in 
California a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a 
register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and 
the Commitments of, and principal amounts (and stated interest) of the 
Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time 
(the “Register”). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent 
manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders 
shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to 
the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement. 
The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower and any 
Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior 
notice.
 
(d) Participations. Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or 
notice to, the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to 
any Person (other than (x) a natural Person, (y) any Loan Party or any of 
any Loan Party’s Affiliates or Subsidiaries or (z) any Person that appears 
on the list of competitors of the Borrower as agreed upon by the Borrower 
and the Administrative Agent, and as modified from time to time with the 
consent of the Administrative Agent) (each, a “Participant”) in all or a 
portion of such Lender’s rights and/or obligations under this Agreement 
(including all or a portion of its Commitments and/or the Loans owing to 
it); provided that (i) such Lender’s obligations under this Agreement shall 
remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the 
other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, and (iii) the 
Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender and the other 
Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in 
connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement. 
For the avoidance of doubt, each Lender shall be responsible for the 
indemnities under Sections 2.20(e) and 9.7 with respect to any payments 
made by such Lender to its Participant(s).

121


Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a 
participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to 
enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver 
of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or 
instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of 
the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver which 
affects such Participant and for which the consent of such Lender is 
required (as described in Section 10.1). The Borrower agrees that each 
Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.19, 2.20 and 
2.21 (subject to the requirements and limitations therein, including the 
requirements under Section 2.20(f) (it being understood that the 
documentation required under Section 2.20(f) shall be delivered to such 
Participant)) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired 
its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section; 
provided that such Participant (A) agrees to be subject to the provisions 
of Section 2.23 as if it were an assignee under paragraph (b) of this 
Section; and (B) shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under 
Sections 2.19 or 2.20, with respect to any participation, than its 
participating Lender would have been entitled to receive, except to the 
extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a change 
in any Requirement of Law that occurs after the Participant acquired the 
applicable participation. Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at 
the Borrower’s request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate 
with the Borrower to effectuate the provisions of Section 2.23 with respect 
to any Participant. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also 
shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.7 as though it were a 
Lender; provided that such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 
2.18(k) as though it were a Lender. Each Lender that sells a participation 
shall, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, maintain 
a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and 
the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant’s interest 
in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the “
Participant Register”); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation 
to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the 
identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant’s 
interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other 
obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent 
that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, 
letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 
5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the 
Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such 
Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant 
Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this 
Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of 
doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) 
shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.
 
(e) Certain Pledges. Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security 
interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure 
obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure 
obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or 
assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder 
or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party 
hereto.
 
(f) Notes. The Borrower, upon receipt by the Borrower of written notice 
from the relevant Lender, agrees to issue Notes to any Lender requiring 
Notes to facilitate transactions of the type described in Section 10.6.
 
(g) Representations and Warranties of Lenders. Each Lender, upon execution 
and delivery hereof or upon succeeding to an interest in the Commitments or 
Loans, as the case may be, represents and warrants as of the Closing Date 
or as of the effective date of the applicable Assignment and Assumption 
that (i) it is an Eligible Assignee; (ii) it has experience and expertise 
in the making of or investing in commitments, loans or investments such as 
the Commitments and Loans; and (iii) it will make or invest in its 
Commitments and Loans for its own account in the ordinary course of its 
business and without a view to distribution of such Commitments and Loans 
within the meaning of the Securities

122


Act or the Exchange Act, or other federal securities laws (it being 
understood that, subject to the provisions of this Section 10.6, the 
disposition of such Commitments and Loans or any interests therein shall at 
all times remain within its exclusive control).
 
10.7 Adjustments; Set-off.
 
(a) Except to the extent that this Agreement expressly provides for 
payments to be allocated to a particular Lender or to the Lenders under a 
particular Facility, if any Lender (a “Benefitted Lender”) shall, at any 
time after the Loans and other amounts payable hereunder shall immediately 
become due and payable pursuant to Section 8.2, receive any payment of all 
or part of the Obligations owing to it, or receive any collateral in 
respect thereof (whether voluntarily or involuntarily, by set-off, pursuant 
to events or proceedings of the nature referred to in Section 8.1(f), or 
otherwise), in a greater proportion than any such payment to or collateral 
received by any other Lender, if any, in respect of the Obligations owing 
to such other Lender, such Benefitted Lender shall purchase for cash from 
the other Lenders a participating interest in such portion of the 
Obligations owing to each such other Lender, or shall provide such other 
Lenders with the benefits of any such collateral, as shall be necessary to 
cause such Benefitted Lender to share the excess payment or benefits of 
such collateral ratably with each of the Lenders; provided that if all or 
any portion of such excess payment or benefits is thereafter recovered from 
such Benefitted Lender, such purchase shall be rescinded, and the purchase 
price and benefits returned, to the extent of such recovery, but without 
interest.
 
(b) Upon (i) the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of 
Default and (ii) obtaining the prior written consent of the Administrative 
Agent, each Lender and each of its Affiliates is hereby authorized at any 
time and from time to time, without prior notice to the Borrower or any 
other Loan Party, any such notice being expressly waived by the Borrower 
and each Loan Party, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, to 
set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, 
provisional or final), in any currency, at any time held or owing, and any 
other credits, indebtedness, claims or obligations, in any currency, in 
each case whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, matured or 
unmatured, at any time held or owing by such Lender, its Affiliates or any 
branch or agency thereof to or for the credit or the account of the 
Borrower or any other Loan Party, as the case may be, against any and all 
of the obligations of the Borrower or such other Loan Party now or 
hereafter existing under this Agreement or any other Loan Document to such 
Lender or its Affiliates, irrespective of whether or not such Lender or 
Affiliate shall have made any demand under this Agreement or any other Loan 
Document and although such obligations of the Borrower or such other Loan 
Party may be contingent or unmatured or are owed to a branch, office or 
Affiliate of such Lender different from the branch, office or Affiliate 
holding such deposit or obligated on such indebtedness; provided, that in 
the event that any Defaulting Lender or any of its Affiliates shall 
exercise any such right of setoff, (x) all amounts so set off shall be paid 
over immediately to the Administrative Agent for further application in 
accordance with the provisions of Section 2.23 and, pending such payment, 
shall be segregated by such Defaulting Lender or Affiliate thereof from its 
other funds and deemed held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative 
Agent and the Lenders, and (y) the Defaulting Lender shall provide promptly 
to the Administrative Agent a statement describing in reasonable detail the 
Obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender or Affiliate thereof as to 
which it exercised such right of setoff. Each Lender agrees to notify the 
Borrower and the Administrative Agent promptly after any such setoff and 
application made by such Lender or any of its Affiliates; provided that the 
failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff 
and application. The rights of each Lender and its Affiliates under this 
Section 10.7 are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other 
rights of set-off) which such Lender or its Affiliates may have.
 
10.8 Payments Set Aside. To the extent that any payment or transfer by or 
on behalf of the Borrower is made to the Administrative Agent or any 
Lender, or the Administrative Agent or any Lender

123


exercises its right of setoff, and such payment or transfer or the proceeds 
of such setoff or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to 
be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to 
any settlement entered into by the Administrative Agent or such Lender in 
its discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in 
connection with any Insolvency Proceeding or otherwise, then (a) to the 
extent of such recovery, the obligation or part thereof originally intended 
to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as 
if such payment had not been made or such setoff had not occurred, and (b) 
each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent upon demand 
its applicable share (without duplication) of any amount so recovered from 
or repaid by the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date 
of such demand to the date such payment is made at a rate per annum equal 
to the Federal Funds Effective Rate from time to time in effect. This 
Section 10.8 shall survive the Discharge of Obligations.
 
10.9 Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary 
contained in any Loan Document, the interest paid or agreed to be paid 
under the Loan Documents shall not exceed the maximum rate of non-usurious 
interest permitted by applicable law (the “Maximum Rate”). If the 
Administrative Agent or any Lender shall receive interest in an amount that 
exceeds the Maximum Rate, the excess interest shall be applied to the 
principal of the Loans or, if it exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to 
the Borrower. In determining whether the interest contracted for, charged, 
or received by the Administrative Agent or a Lender exceeds the Maximum 
Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, (a) 
characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or 
premium rather than interest, (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the 
effects thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal 
or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated 
term of the Obligations hereunder.
 
10.10 Counterparts; Electronic Execution of Assignments.
 
(a) This Agreement may be executed by one or more of the parties to this 
Agreement on any number of separate counterparts, and all of said 
counterparts taken together shall be deemed to constitute one and the same 
instrument. Delivery of an executed signature page of this Agreement by 
facsimile or other electronic mail transmission shall be effective as 
delivery of a manually executed counterpart hereof. A set of the copies of 
this Agreement signed by all the parties shall be lodged with the Borrower 
and the Administrative Agent.
 
(b) The words “execution,” “signed,” “signature,” and words of like import 
in any Assignment and Assumption shall be deemed to include electronic 
signatures or the keeping of records in electronic form, each of which 
shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability as a manually 
executed signature or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the 
case may be, to the extent and as provided for in any applicable law, 
including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce 
Act, the New York State Electronic Signatures and Records Act, or any other 
similar state laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act.
 
10.11 Severability. Any provision of this Agreement that is prohibited or 
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be 
ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without 
invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or 
unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render 
unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. Without limiting 
the foregoing provisions of this Section 10.11, if and to the extent that 
the enforceability of any provisions in this Agreement relating to 
Defaulting Lenders shall be limited under or in connection with any 
Insolvency Proceeding, as determined in good faith by the Administrative 
Agent or the Issuing Lender, as applicable, then such provisions shall be 
deemed to be in effect only to the extent not so limited.

124


10.12 Integration. This Agreement and the other Loan Documents represent 
the entire agreement of the Borrower, the other Loan Parties, the 
Administrative Agent and the Lenders with respect to the subject matter 
hereof and thereof, and there are no promises, undertakings, 
representations or warranties by the Administrative Agent or any Lender 
relative to the subject matter hereof not expressly set forth or referred 
to herein or in the other Loan Documents.
 
10.13 GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE 
PARTIES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED AND 
INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. This 
Section 10.13 shall survive the Discharge of Obligations.
 
10.14 Submission to Jurisdiction; Waivers. The Borrower hereby irrevocably 
and unconditionally:
 
(a) submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the State and Federal courts 
in the Southern District of the State of New York; provided that nothing in 
this Agreement shall be deemed to operate to preclude the Administrative 
Agent or any Lender from bringing suit or taking other legal action in any 
other jurisdiction to realize on the Collateral or any other security for 
the Obligations, or to enforce a judgment or other court order in favor of 
Administrative Agent or such Lender. The Borrower expressly submits and 
consents in advance to such jurisdiction in any action or suit commenced in 
any such court, and the Borrower hereby waives any objection that it may 
have based upon lack of personal jurisdiction, improper venue, or forum non 
conveniens and hereby consents to the granting of such legal or equitable 
relief as is deemed appropriate by such court. The Borrower hereby waives 
personal service of the summons, complaints, and other process issued in 
such action or suit and agrees that service of such summons, complaints, 
and other process may be made by registered or certified mail addressed to 
the Borrower at the addresses set forth in Section 10.2 of this Agreement 
and that service so made shall be deemed completed upon the earlier to 
occur of the Borrower’s actual receipt thereof or three (3) days after 
deposit in the U.S. mails, proper postage prepaid;
 
(b) WAIVES, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ITS RIGHT TO A JURY 
TRIAL OF ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR BASED UPON THIS 
AGREEMENT, THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS OR ANY CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTION, 
INCLUDING CONTRACT, TORT, BREACH OF DUTY AND ALL OTHER CLAIMS. THIS WAIVER 
IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT FOR THE PARTIES TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT. EACH 
PARTY HAS REVIEWED THIS WAIVER WITH ITS COUNSEL; and
 
(c) waives, to the maximum extent not prohibited by law, any right it may 
have to claim or recover in any legal action or proceeding referred to in 
this Section any special, exemplary, punitive or consequential damages.
 
This Section 10.14 shall survive the Discharge of Obligations.
 
10.15 Acknowledgements. The Borrower hereby acknowledges that:
 
(a) it has been advised by counsel in the negotiation, execution and 
delivery of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents;
 
(b) none of the Administrative Agent nor any Lender has any fiduciary 
relationship with or duty to the Borrower arising out of or in connection 
with this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, and the 
relationship between the Administrative Agent and Lenders, on one hand,

125


and the Borrower, on the other hand, in connection herewith or therewith is 
solely that of debtor and creditor; and
 
(c) no joint venture is created hereby or by the other Loan Documents or 
otherwise exists by virtue of the transactions contemplated hereby among 
the Lenders or among the Borrower and the Lenders.
 
10.16 Releases of Guarantees and Liens.
 
(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any 
other Loan Document, the Administrative Agent is hereby irrevocably 
authorized by each Lender (without requirement of notice to or consent of 
any Lender except as expressly required by Section 10.1) to take any action 
requested by the Borrower having the effect of releasing any Collateral or 
Guarantee Obligations (1) to the extent necessary to permit consummation of 
any transaction not prohibited by any Loan Document or that has been 
consented to in accordance with Section 10.1 or (2) under the circumstances 
described in Section 10.16(b) below.
 
(b) At such time as the Loans and the other Obligations under the Loan 
Documents including, without limitation, obligations under Specified Swap 
Agreements and Bank Services Agreements (other than inchoate indemnity 
obligations and obligations under or in respect of Specified Swap 
Agreements and Bank Services, to the extent no default or termination event 
shall have occurred thereunder) unless the obligations under such 
agreements have been Cash Collateralized or otherwise secured to the 
satisfaction of the Administrative Agent and any Qualified Counterparty or 
provider of such Bank Services, as applicable, shall have been paid in 
full, the Commitments have been terminated and no Letters of Credit shall 
be outstanding, the Collateral shall be released from the Liens created by 
the Security Documents, and the Security Documents and all obligations 
(other than those expressly stated to survive such termination) of the 
Administrative Agent and each Loan Party under the Security Documents shall 
terminate, all without delivery of any instrument or performance of any act 
by any Person.
 
10.17 Treatment of Certain Information; Confidentiality. Each of the 
Administrative Agent and each Lender agrees to maintain the confidentiality 
of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be 
disclosed (a) to its Affiliates and to its Related Parties (it being 
understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be 
informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to 
keep such Information confidential); (b) to the extent required or 
requested by any regulatory authority purporting to have jurisdiction over 
such Person or its Related Parties (including any self-regulatory 
authority, such as the National Association of Insurance Commissioners); 
(c) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any 
subpoena or similar legal process, upon the request or demand of any 
Governmental Authority, in response to any order of any court or other 
Governmental Authority or as may otherwise be required pursuant to any 
Requirement of Law or if requested or required to do so in connection with 
any litigation or similar proceeding; (d) to any other party hereto; (e) in 
connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or under any other 
Loan Document or any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any 
other Loan Document or the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder; 
(f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as 
those of this Section, to (i) any assignee of or Participant in, or any 
prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights and 
obligations under this Agreement, or (ii) any actual or prospective party 
(or its Related Parties) to any swap, derivative or other transaction under 
which payments are to be made by reference to the Borrower and its 
obligations, this Agreement or payments hereunder; (g) on a confidential 
basis to (i) any rating agency in connection with rating the Borrower or 
its Subsidiaries or the Facilities or (ii) the CUSIP Service Bureau or any 
similar agency in connection with the issuance and monitoring of CUSIP 
numbers with respect to the Facilities; (h) with the consent of the 
Borrower; or (i)

126


to the extent such Information (x) becomes publicly available other than as 
a result of a breach of this Section, or (y) becomes available to the 
Administrative Agent, any Lender or any of their respective Affiliates on a 
non-confidential basis from a source other than the Borrower.
 
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any party to this 
Agreement (and any employee, representative, or other agent of any party to 
this Agreement) may disclose to any and all persons, without limitation of 
any kind, the tax treatment and tax structure of the transactions 
contemplated by this Agreement and all materials of any kind (including 
opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided to it relating to such 
tax treatment and tax structure. However, any such information relating to 
the tax treatment or tax structure is required to be kept confidential to 
the extent necessary to comply with any applicable federal or state 
securities laws.
 
For purposes of this Section, “Information” means all information received 
from the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries relating to the Borrower or 
any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective businesses, other than 
any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent or any 
Lender on a non-confidential basis prior to disclosure by the Borrower or 
any of its Subsidiaries; provided that, in the case of information received 
from the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries after the date hereof, such 
information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential. 
Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as 
provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its 
obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to 
maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would 
accord to its own confidential information.
 
10.18 Automatic Debits. With respect to any principal, interest, fee, or 
any other cost or expense (including attorney costs of the Administrative 
Agent or any Lender payable by the Borrower hereunder) due and payable to 
the Administrative Agent or any Lender under the Loan Documents, the 
Borrower hereby irrevocably authorizes the Administrative Agent to debit 
any deposit account of the Borrower maintained with the Administrative 
Agent in an amount such that the aggregate amount debited from all such 
deposit accounts does not exceed such principal, interest, fee or other 
cost or expense. If there are insufficient funds in such deposit accounts 
to cover the amount then due, such debits will be reversed (in whole or in 
part, in the Administrative Agent’s sole discretion) and such amount not 
debited shall be deemed to be unpaid. No such debit under this Section 
10.18 shall be deemed a set-off.
 
10.19 Judgment Currency. If, for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any 
court, it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder or any other Loan 
Document in one currency into another currency, the rate of exchange used 
shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the 
Administrative Agent could purchase the first currency with such other 
currency on the Business Day preceding that on which final judgment is 
given. The obligation of each Borrower and each other Loan Party in respect 
of any such sum due from it to the Administrative Agent or any Lender 
hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall, notwithstanding any 
judgment in a currency (the “Judgment Currency”) other than that in which 
such sum is denominated in accordance with the applicable provisions of 
this Agreement (the “Agreement Currency”), be discharged only to the extent 
that on the Business Day following receipt by the Administrative Agent or 
such Lender, as the case may be, of any sum adjudged to be so due in the 
Judgment Currency, the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may 
be, may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase the Agreement 
Currency with the Judgment Currency. If the amount of the Agreement 
Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to the 
Administrative Agent or any Lender from any Borrower or any other Loan 
Party in the Agreement Currency, such Borrower and each other Loan Party 
agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to 
indemnify the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, 
against such loss. If the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is 
greater than the sum originally due to the Administrative Agent or any 
Lender in such currency, the Administrative Agent or

127


such Lender, as the case may be, agrees to return the amount of any excess 
to such Borrower or other Loan Party, as applicable (or to any other Person 
who may be entitled thereto under applicable law).
 
10.20 Patriot Act. Each Lender and the Administrative Agent (for itself and 
not on behalf of any other party) hereby notifies the Borrower that, 
pursuant to the requirements of the Patriot Act, it is required to obtain, 
verify and record information that identifies the Borrower, which 
information includes the names and addresses and other information that 
will allow such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, to 
identify the Borrower in accordance with the Patriot Act. The Borrower 
will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, provide, to the extent 
commercially reasonable or required by any Requirement of Law, such 
information and take such actions as are reasonably requested by the 
Administrative Agent or any Lender to assist the Administrative Agent and 
the Lenders in maintaining compliance with the Patriot Act.
 
10.21 Non-Public Information.
 
(a) Each Lender acknowledges that all information, including requests for 
waivers and amendments, furnished by the Borrower or the Administrative 
Agent pursuant to or in connection with, or in the course of administering, 
this Agreement will be lender-level information, which may contain MNPI. 
Each Lender acknowledges that (a) it has developed compliance procedures 
regarding the use of material non-public information and (b) it will handle 
such material non-public information in accordance with Applicable Law.
 
(b) The Borrower and each Lender acknowledge that, in the event that any 
Lender has Public Side Lender Representatives, if information furnished by 
the Borrower pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement is being 
distributed by the Administrative Agent through the Platform, (i) the 
Administrative Agent may post any information that the Borrower has 
indicated as containing MNPI solely on that portion of the Platform as is 
designated for Private Side Lender Representatives and (ii) if the Borrower 
has not indicated whether any information furnished by it pursuant to or in 
connection with this Agreement contains MNPI, the Administrative Agent 
reserves the right to post such information solely on that portion of the 
Platform as is designated for Private Side Lender Representatives. The 
Borrower agrees to clearly designate all information provided to the 
Administrative Agent by or on behalf the Borrower that is suitable to be 
made available to Public Side Lender Representatives, and the 
Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such designation by 
the Borrower without liability or responsibility for the independent

Nothing herein contained shall be construed as a substitution or novation 
of the obligations outstanding under the Existing Credit Agreement, the 
other Original Loan Documents or instruments securing the same, which shall 
remain in full force and effect, except as modified hereby or by 
instruments executed concurrently herewith. Nothing expressed or implied in 
this Agreement shall be construed as a release or other discharge of the

connection therewith. The Borrower hereby (a) confirms and agrees that each 
Original Loan Document to which it is a party that is not being amended and 
restated concurrently herewith is, and shall continue to be, in full force 
and effect and is hereby ratified and confirmed in all respects except that 
on and after the Closing Date, all references in any such Original Loan 
Document to “the Credit Agreement,” “thereto,” “thereof,” “thereunder” or 
words of like import referring to the Existing Credit Agreement shall mean 
the Existing Credit Agreement as amended and restated by this Agreement; 
and (b) confirms and agrees that to the extent that any such Original Loan 
Document purports to assign or pledge to any Secured Party a security 
interest in or lien on, any collateral as security for all or any portion 
of any of the Obligations of the Borrower or any other Loan Party, as the 
case may be, from time to time existing in respect of the Existing Credit 
Agreement or the Original Loan Document, such pledge or assignment or grant 
of the security interest or lien is hereby ratified and confirmed in all 
respects with respect to this Agreement and the Loan Documents.
