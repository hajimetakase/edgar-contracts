With respect to the Equity Consideration to be received by the IDR Sellers, 
each IDR Seller agrees that, during the period beginning on and including 
the Closing Date until the date that is six months from the Closing Date 
(the “Lock-up Period”), such IDR Seller will not, without the prior written 
consent of CST, directly or indirectly:
            (i)
offer, pledge, sell, contract to sell, grant any option or contract to 
purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell, grant any right or

Seller; or
            (ii)

transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences 
of ownership of the Equity Consideration to be received by such IDR Seller;

settled by delivery of all or any portion of the Equity Consideration, 
other securities, in cash or otherwise; provided, however, that commencing 
on the day after the Lock-up Period ends, the IDR Sellers may make sales of 
all or any portion of the Equity Consideration, in compliance with and 
pursuant to the provisions of Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act 
of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”).

      (b)
Subject to Section 1.4(a) above, each IDR Seller further agrees that CST 
may, with respect to all or any portion of the Equity Consideration, cause 
CST’s transfer agent or other registrar to enter stop transfer instructions 
and implement stop transfer procedures with respect to such securities 
during the Lock-up Period.


Article II

the IDR Sellers is party will be duly executed and delivered by such IDR 
Seller and will constitute such IDR Seller’s valid and binding obligation 
enforceable against such IDR Seller in accordance with its terms, except as

offer from any Person or group of Persons other than CST, the IDR Buyer and 
their Affiliates (a “Competing Transaction”) to acquire all or any portion 
of the IDRs, whether by merger, purchase of equity, purchase of assets, 
tender offer or otherwise, or provide any non-public information to any 
third party in connection with a Competing Transaction or enter into any 
agreement, arrangement or understanding requiring any IDR Seller to 
abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the transactions contemplated by 
this Agreement, unless this Agreement has been terminated pursuant to and 
in accordance with Article VI of this Agreement. The IDR Sellers agree to 
immediately notify CST and the IDR Buyer if any member of the IDR Sellers 
Group receives any indications of interest, requests for information or 
offers in respect of a Competing Transaction and will communicate to CST 
and the IDR Buyer in reasonable detail the terms of any such indication, 
request or offer.
      (b)

of equity, purchase of assets, tender offer or otherwise, or provide any 
non-public information to any third party in connection with a IDR 
Competing Transaction or enter into any agreement, arrangement or 
understanding requiring CST or IDR Buyer to abandon, terminate or fail to 
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, unless this 
Agreement has been terminated pursuant to and in accordance with Article VI
 of this Agreement. CST and the IDR Buyer agree to immediately notify the 
IDR Sellers if any member of the IDR Buyer Group receives any indications 
of interest, requests for information or offers in respect of an IDR

12
------------------------------------------------------------------------




            Competing Transaction and will communicate to the IDR Sellers
            in reasonable detail the terms of any such indication, request

Section 4.10    Employee Matters.  


For a period of two years from and after the Closing Date, no IDR Seller 
nor any of its Affiliates shall solicit for employment or hire any 
Transferred Employee; provided, however, that such individuals shall not be 
third party beneficiaries of this Agreement and this shall not be deemed to 
amend any Employee Plan. The restrictions in this Section 4.10 regarding 
the prohibition on solicitations (as opposed to hires) shall not apply to 
any solicitation directed at the general public and the restrictions 
regarding hiring shall not apply to any former employee terminated by CST 
or any Affiliate of CST. For the avoidance of doubt, LGC’s continued 
employment of the Transferred Employees through December 31, 2014 shall not 
be deemed a violation of this Section 4.10.

In the event and for so long as any Party actively is contesting or 
defending against any third-party Legal Proceeding (other than any Legal 
Proceedings in which CST, IDR Buyer or any of their Affiliates and the IDR 
Sellers or any of their Affiliates are adverse parties) in connection with 
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of the other Parties 
will cooperate with such Party and its counsel in the contest or defense, 
make available their personnel and provide such testimony and access to 
their books and records as shall be reasonably requested and necessary in 
connection with the contest or defense, all at the sole cost and expense of 
the contesting or defending Party; provided, however, that nothing in this 
Section 4.11 shall limit in any respect any rights a Party may have with 
respect to discovery or the production of documents or other information in 
connection with any such litigation.


Section 4.12    Closing Date Ancillary Agreements.

      (a)
This Agreement may be terminated and the transactions contemplated by this 
Agreement may be abandoned at any time before the Closing as follows:
            (i)
by the mutual written agreement of the Parties;
            (ii)
by the IDR Sellers, upon joint written notice to CST and the IDR Buyer, if 
there has been a Breach on the part of CST or IDR Buyer, which Breach, 
either individually or in the aggregate, would result in, if occurring or 
continuing on the Closing Date, the failure of the conditions set forth in 
Section 5.3(c) or Section 5.3(d), and such Breach is incapable of being 
cured, or if capable of being cured, has not been cured within thirty (30) 
days following receipt by CST and IDR Buyer of a Notification of such 
Breach from the IDR Sellers.
            (i)
by CST or the IDR Buyer, upon written notice to the IDR Sellers, if there 
has been a Breach on the part of any IDR Seller, which Breach, either 
individually or in the aggregate, would result in, if occurring or 
continuing on the Closing Date, the failure of the conditions set forth in 
Section 5.2(c) or Section 5.2(d), and such Breach is incapable of being 
cured, or if capable of being cured, has not been cured within thirty (30) 
days following receipt by the IDR Sellers of a Notification of such Breach 
from CST or the IDR Buyer; or
            (ii)
by any Party, upon written notice to the other Parties, if the transactions 
contemplated by this Agreement have not been consummated on or before 
November 1, 2014 (the “Outside Date”); provided, however, that (i) IDR 
Sellers may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 
6.1(a)(iv) if such failure to consummate is due to the failure of any IDR 
Seller to perform or observe in all material respects the covenants and 
agreements of this Agreement to be performed or observed by such IDR Seller 
and (ii) CST and IDR Buyer may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to 
this Section 6.1(a)(iv) if such failure to consummate is due to the failure 
of CST or IDR Buyer to perform or observe in all material respects the 
covenants and agreements of this Agreement to be performed or observed by 
CST or IDR Buyer.
      (b)
This Agreement shall automatically terminate and the transactions 
contemplated by this Agreement shall be abandoned if the GP Purchase

Agreement.

15
------------------------------------------------------------------------




Section 6.2    Effect of Termination.  


In the event of termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Article VI, 
all rights and obligations of the Parties under this Agreement shall 
terminate, except the provisions of Section 4.6 (Confidential Information), 
Article VI (Termination), Article VIII (Miscellaneous Provisions) and 
Article IX (Definitions) shall survive such termination; provided, however
, that nothing in this Agreement shall relieve any Party from any liability 
for any intentional or willful and material Breach by such Party and all 
rights and remedies of a non-breaching Party under this Agreement in the 
case of such intentional or willful and material Breach, whether arising at 
law or in equity, shall be preserved.


Section 6.3    Specific Performance.  


The Parties acknowledge that, in view of the uniqueness of the transactions 
contemplated by this Agreement, the Parties will not have an adequate 
remedy at Law for monetary damages and will be irreparably damaged in the 
event that Closing fails to occur, or is rendered incapable of occurring, 
as a result any other Party’s Breach of any term of this Agreement; and, 
therefore, the Parties agree that each Party, as the case may be, shall be 
entitled to specific enforcement of the terms of this Agreement to compel 
the other Parties, as the case may be, to consummate the transactions 
contemplated by this Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions of this 
Agreement.

All covenants and agreements that by their terms apply or are to be 
performed in whole or in part after the Closing shall survive for the 
period provided in such covenants and agreements, if any, or until fully

Section 7.2(b)(i) and Section 8.2(b)(i) of the GP Purchase Agreement, in 
each case, shall not exceed $8,500,000 (the “Cap”); provided, however, that 
the Cap shall not be applicable to (A) Losses with respect to the Seller 
Fundamental Representations or the Buyer Fundamental Representations, as 
applicable, in each case whether made in this Agreement or in the GP 
Purchase Agreement (B) Losses with respect to matters that constitute fraud 
or intentional misrepresentation or (C) Losses with respect to the matters

or against CST, IDR Buyer or GP Buyer under Section 7.2(b)(i) or Section 
8.2(b)(i) of the GP Purchase Agreement shall be required unless and until 
the cumulative aggregate amount of such Losses incurred by the Buyer 
Indemnified Parties or the Seller Indemnified Parties, in each case as a 
group, exceeds $1,000,000 (the “Deductible”), at which point the Topper 
Trust and LGC shall be obligated to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties 
or CST, the IDR Buyer and GP Buyer shall be obligated to indemnify the 
Seller Indemnified Parties, as the case may be, only for the amount of such 
Losses in excess of the Deductible; provided, however, that the Deductible

Fundamental Representations or the Buyer Fundamental Representations, as 
applicable, in each case whether made in this Agreement or in the GP

            (iii)

Indemnified Party, as the case may be (such party seeking indemnification 
pursuant to this Article VII, the “Indemnified Party,” and the other party, 
the “Indemnifying Party”), shall be reduced by any third-party insurance 
benefits or third party recoveries actually received, or tax benefits 
recognizable, by the Indemnified Party with

17
------------------------------------------------------------------------




                  respect to such Loss (net of costs incurred to recover
                  such insurance benefits and third party recoveries,
                  deductibles and retropremiums);

            (iv)
no claim may be asserted nor may any action be commenced against any Party 
for Breach, unless written notice of such claim or action is received by 
the other Party describing in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances 
with respect to the subject matter of such claim or action on or prior to 
the date on which the representation or warranty on which such claim or 
action is based ceases to survive as set forth in Section 7.1; provided, 
however, that, notwithstanding the survival periods set forth in Section 
7.1, as to each claim for indemnification under this Agreement regarding a 
representation or warranty that is validly made before expiration of such 
representation or warranty, such claim and associated right to 
indemnification will not terminate before the final determination and 
satisfaction of such claim; and
            (v)
no Indemnified Party shall be entitled under this Agreement to multiple 
recovery for the same Losses.


Section 7.3    Procedures.  


Any Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party (with reasonable 
detail) promptly after it becomes aware of facts supporting a claim or 
action for which indemnification is provided under this Article VII, and 
shall provide to the Indemnifying Party as soon as practicable thereafter 
all reasonably available information and documentation necessary to support 
and verify any Losses associated with such claim or action. Subject to 
Section 7.2(c)(iv), the failure to so notify or provide information to the 
Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any 
liability that it may have to any Indemnified Party, except to the extent 
that the Indemnifying Party demonstrates that it has been materially 
prejudiced by the Indemnified Party’s failure to give such notice, in which 
case the Indemnifying Party shall be relieved from its obligations under 
this Agreement to the extent of such material prejudice. The Indemnifying 
Party shall participate in and defend, contest or otherwise protect the 
Indemnified Party against any such claim or action by counsel of the 
Indemnifying Party’s choice at the Indemnifying Party’s sole cost and 
expense; provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall not make any 
settlement or compromise without the prior written consent of the 
Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, 
conditioned or delayed) unless the sole relief provided is monetary damages 
that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party, there is no admission or 
statement of fault or culpability on the part of the Indemnified Party and 
there is an unconditional release of the Indemnified Party from all 
liability on any claims that are the subject of such claim or action. The 
Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts upon the 
reasonable request of the Indemnifying Party to cooperate with and assist 
the Indemnifying Party in defending, contesting, or otherwise protecting 
the Indemnified Party against any suit, action, investigation, claim or 
proceeding in connection with which a claim for indemnification is made.

Section 8.5    Entire Agreement.  


This Agreement, together with the Schedules and the Exhibits hereto, the 
other Transaction Documents and the Confidentiality Agreement represent the 
entire agreement and understanding of the Parties with respect to the 
transactions set forth herein and therein, and no representations or 
warranties have been made in connection herewith or therewith other than 
those expressly set forth herein or therein. This Agreement, together with 
the Schedules and the Exhibits hereto, the other Transaction Documents and 
the Confidentiality Agreement supersede all prior negotiations, 
discussions, correspondence, communications, understandings and agreements 
between the Parties relating to the subject matter hereof or thereof and 
all prior drafts of such documents, all of which are merged into this 
Agreement, the other Transaction Documents and the Confidentiality 
Agreement, as applicable. No prior drafts of such documents and no words or 
phrases from any such prior drafts shall be admissible into evidence in any 
action or suit involving such documents.


Section 8.6    Waivers and Amendments.  


The IDR Sellers (on the one hand) or CST and IDR Buyer (on the other hand) 
may, by written notice to the other Party: (a) extend the time for the 
performance of any of the obligations or other actions of such other Party; 
(b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations or warranties of such 
other Party contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered 
pursuant to this Agreement by such other Party; (c) waive compliance with

its own obligations under this Agreement or in any documents delivered 
pursuant to this Agreement by such other Party. The waiver by any Party of 
a Breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be 
construed as a waiver of any subsequent Breach, whether or not similar,

Section 8.7    Severability.

good faith to modify this Agreement to include a provision as similar in

Section 8.8    Titles and Headings.  


The Article and Section headings and any table of contents contained in

the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement or of any term or provision 
hereof.


Section 8.9    Signatures and Counterparts.  


Facsimile or electronic transmission of any signed original document and/or 
retransmission of any signed facsimile or electronic transmission shall be

Parties will confirm facsimile or electronic transmission by signing a 
duplicate original document. This Agreement may be executed in two or more 
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which 
together shall be considered one and the same agreement.


Section 8.10    Post-Closing Enforcement of the Agreement; Damages.  


Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that an award of monetary 
damages would be inadequate for any Breach of this Agreement by any Party 
of any covenant or obligation to be performed after the Closing, and any 
such Breach would cause the non-breaching Parties irreparable harm. Each of 
the Parties acknowledges and agrees that in the event any covenant or 
obligation of the acknowledging Party to be performed after Closing is not 
performed in accordance with the specific terms of this Agreement or is 
otherwise breached, then the other Party shall be entitled to an injunction 
or injunctions to prevent such non-performance or Breach and to 
specifically enforce the covenants and obligations of the acknowledging 
Party to be performed after Closing, in any courts of the State of 
Delaware, and in the federal courts of the United States of America located 
in Delaware, in addition to any other remedy to which the non-breaching 
Party may be entitled for such non-performance or Breach.


Section 8.11    Governing Law. 


This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the 
internal and substantive Laws of the State of Delaware and without regard 
to any conflicts of Laws concepts that would apply the substantive Law of 
some other jurisdiction.


Section 8.12    Disclosure.  


Certain information set forth in the Schedules is included solely for 
informational purposes, is not an admission of liability with respect to 
the matters covered by the information, and may not be required to be 
disclosed pursuant to this Agreement. Disclosure of any item in any section 
of the Schedules shall serve to qualify the correspondingly numbered 
section or subsection in this Agreement and any other section or subsection 
of this Agreement to the extent the applicability of such disclosure to 
such section of subsection is reasonably apparent on its face to the 
non-disclosing party. The specification of any dollar amount in the 
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or the inclusion 
of any specific item in the Schedules is not intended to imply that such 
amounts (or higher or lower amounts) or specific item are or are not 
material, and no party shall use the fact of the setting of such amounts or 
the fact of the inclusion of any such item in the Schedules in any dispute 
or controversy between the Parties as to whether any obligation, item, or 
matter not described in this Agreement or included in a Schedule is or is 
not material for purposes of this Agreement.


Section 8.13    Consent to Jurisdiction.  


To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, the Parties hereby 
irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of 
Delaware and of the federal courts of the United States of America located 
in Delaware over any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement 
or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and each Party 
irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect of such dispute or proceeding 
shall be heard and determined in such courts. The Parties hereby 
irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any 
objection that they may now or hereafter have to the venue of any dispute 
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions 
contemplated by this Agreement brought in such court or any defense of 
inconvenient forum for the maintenance of such dispute. Each Party agrees 
that a judgment in any dispute heard in the venue specified by this section 
may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any 
other manner provided by applicable Law.


Section 8.14    Waiver of Trial by Jury.  


EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT 
PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL 
PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT.
