Section 1.02 Terms Generally. The definitions set forth or referred to in 
Section 1.01 shall apply equally to both the singular and plural forms of 
the terms defined. Whenever the context may require, any pronoun shall 
include the corresponding masculine, feminine and neuter forms. The words 
include, includes and including shall be deemed to be followed by the 
phrase without limitation. All references herein to Articles, Sections, 
Exhibits and Schedules shall be deemed references to Articles and Sections 
of, and Exhibits and Schedules to, this Agreement unless the context shall 
otherwise require. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, any 
reference in this Agreement to any Loan Document shall mean such document 
as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time. 
Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all terms of an accounting

Administrative Agent that the Borrower requests an amendment to any 
provision hereof to eliminate the effect of any change occurring after the

provision (or if the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower that the 
Required Lenders request an amendment to any provision hereof for such

occur. Except for purposes of financial statements delivered by Loan 
Parties hereunder or calculating financial ratios hereunder or except as

than Dollars) for purposes of the Loan Documents shall be such Dollar 
Equivalent amount as determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance

limitation or threshold set forth in Dollars in Article VI or clause (f) or

such determination is being made.

Letter of Credit, an amount, such as a required minimum or multiple amount,

herein:

(a) each Lender agrees to make Term B Loans in Dollars to the Borrower on 
the Closing Date in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed its Term B 
Loan Commitment, and

(b) each Lender agrees to make Revolving Facility Loans of a Class in 
Dollars to the Borrower from time to time during the Availability Period in 
an aggregate principal amount that will not result in (i) such Lenders 
Revolving Facility Credit Exposure of such Class exceeding such Lenders 
Revolving Facility Commitment of such Class or (ii) the Revolving Facility 
Credit Exposure of such Class exceeding the total Revolving Facility 
Commitments of such Class. Within the foregoing limits and subject to the 
terms and conditions set forth herein, the Borrower may borrow, prepay and 
reborrow Revolving Facility Loans, and

(c) each Lender having an Incremental Term Loan Commitment agrees, subject 
to the terms and conditions set forth in the applicable Incremental 
Assumption Agreement, to make Incremental Term Loans to the Borrower in an

Borrowing consisting of Loans under the same Facility and of the same Type 
made by the Lenders ratably in accordance with their respective Commitments 
under the applicable Facility (or, in the case of Swingline Loans, in 
accordance with their respective Swingline Commitments); provided, however
, that Revolving Facility Loans of any Class shall be made by the Revolving 
Facility Lenders of such Class ratably in accordance with their respective 
Revolving Facility Percentages on the date such Loans are made hereunder. 
The failure of any Lender to make any Loan required to be made by it shall 
not relieve any other Lender of its obligations hereunder; provided, that 
the Commitments of the Lenders are several and no Lender shall be 
responsible for any other Lenders failure to make Loans as required.

(b) Subject to Section 2.14, each Borrowing (other than a Swingline 
Borrowing) shall be comprised entirely of ABR Loans or Eurocurrency Loans 
as the Borrower may request in accordance herewith. Each Swingline 
Borrowing shall be an ABR Borrowing. Each Lender at its option may make any 
ABR Loan or Eurocurrency Loan by causing any domestic or foreign branch or 
Affiliate of such Lender to make such Loan; provided, that any exercise of 
such option shall not affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay such 
Loan in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and such Lender shall 
not be entitled to any amounts payable under Section 2.15 or 2.17 solely in 
respect of increased costs resulting from such exercise and existing at the 
time of such exercise.

(c) At the commencement of each Interest Period for any Eurocurrency 
Revolving Facility Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be in an aggregate 
amount that is an integral multiple of the Borrowing Multiple and not less 
than the Borrowing Minimum. At the time that each ABR Revolving Facility 
Borrowing is made, such Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount that is 
an integral multiple of the Borrowing Multiple and not less than the 
Borrowing Minimum; provided, that an ABR Revolving Facility Borrowing may 
be in an aggregate amount that is equal to the entire unused available 
balance of the Revolving Facility Commitments or that is required to 
finance the reimbursement of an L/C Disbursement as contemplated by Section 
2.05(e). Each Swingline Borrowing shall be in an amount that is an integral 
multiple of the Borrowing Multiple and not less than the Borrowing Minimum. 
Borrowings of more than one Type may be outstanding at the same time; 
provided, however, that the Borrower shall not be entitled to request any 
Borrowing that, if made, would result in more than 10 Eurocurrency 
Borrowings outstanding under all Facilities at any time. Borrowings having 
different Interest Periods, regardless of whether they commence on the same 
date, shall be considered separate Borrowings.

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Borrower 
shall not be entitled to request, or to elect to convert or continue, any 
Borrowing of any Class if the Interest Period requested with respect 
thereto would end after the Revolving Facility Maturity Date or the Term 
Facility Maturity Date for such Class, as applicable.

applicable Class exceeding the total Revolving Facility Commitments of such 
Class; provided, that the Swingline Lender shall not be required to make a 
Swingline Loan to refinance an outstanding Swingline Borrowing. Within the

Administrative Agent and the Swingline Lender of such request by telephone

Borrowing. The Swingline Lender shall consult with the Administrative Agent 
as to whether the making of the Swingline Loan is in accordance with the 
terms of this Agreement prior to the Swingline Lender funding such 
Swingline Loan. The Swingline Lender shall make each Swingline Loan on the 
proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds by 
3:00 p.m., Local Time, to the account of the Borrower (or, in the case of a 
Swingline Borrowing made to finance the reimbursement of an L/C

applicable Issuing Bank).

(c) The Swingline Lender may by written notice given to the Administrative 
Agent not later than 10:00 a.m., Local Time, on any Business Day require

participate. Promptly upon receipt of such notice, the Administrative Agent 
will give notice thereof to each such Lender, specifying in such notice 
such Revolving Facility Lenders applicable Revolving Facility Percentage 
of such Swingline Loan or Loans. Each Revolving Facility Lender hereby 
absolutely and unconditionally agrees, upon receipt of notice as provided 
above, to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swingline 
Lender, such Revolving Facility Lenders applicable Revolving Facility 
Percentage of such Swingline Loan or Loans. Each Revolving Facility Lender 
acknowledges and agrees that its respective obligation to acquire 
participations in Swingline Loans pursuant to this paragraph is absolute 
and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, 
including the occurrence and continuance of a Default or Event of Default 
or reduction or termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment 
shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction 
whatsoever. Each Revolving Facility Lender shall comply with its obligation 
under this paragraph by wire transfer of immediately available funds, in 
the same manner as provided in Section 2.06 with respect to Loans made by 
such Revolving Facility Lender (and Section 2.06 shall apply, mutatis 
mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Lenders), and the 
Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the Swingline Lender the amounts 
so received by it from the Revolving Facility Lenders. The Administrative 
Agent shall notify the Borrower of any participations in any Swingline Loan 
acquired pursuant to this paragraph (c), and thereafter payments in respect 
of such Swingline Loan shall be made to the Administrative Agent and not to 
the Swingline Lender. Any amounts received by the Swingline Lender from the 
Borrower (or other party on behalf of the Borrower) in respect of a 
Swingline Loan after receipt by the Swingline Lender of the proceeds of a 
sale of participations therein shall be promptly remitted to the 
Administrative Agent; any such amounts received by the Administrative Agent 
shall be promptly remitted by the Administrative Agent to the Revolving 
Facility Lenders

Swingline Lender, as their interests may appear; provided, that any such 
payment so remitted shall be repaid to the Swingline Lender or to the 
Administrative Agent, as applicable, if and to the extent such payment is 
required to be refunded to the Borrower for any reason. The purchase of 
participations in a Swingline Loan pursuant to this paragraph shall not 
relieve the Borrower of any default in the payment thereof.

(d) The Borrower may, at any time and from time to time, designate as 
additional Swingline Lenders one or more Revolving Facility Lenders that 
agree to serve in such capacity as provided below. The acceptance by a 
Revolving Facility Lender of an appointment as a Swingline Lender hereunder 
shall be evidenced by an agreement, which shall be in form and substance 
reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, 
executed by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and such designated 
Swingline Lender, and, from and after the effective date of such agreement, 
(i) such Revolving Facility Lender shall have all the rights and 
obligations of a Swingline Lender under this Agreement and (ii) references 
herein to the term Swingline Lender shall be deemed to include such 
Revolving Facility Lender in its capacity as a lender of Swingline Loans 
hereunder.

and prior to the date that is five Business Days prior to the applicable 
Revolving Facility Maturity Date. In the event of any inconsistency between 
the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of 
any form of letter of credit application or other agreement submitted by 
the Borrower to, or entered into by the Borrower with, an Issuing Bank 
relating to any Letter of Credit, the terms and conditions of this 
Agreement shall control.

(b) Notice of Issuance, Amendment, Renewal, Extension: Certain Conditions.

address of the beneficiary thereof, whether such Letter of Credit 
constitutes a Standby Letter of Credit or a Trade Letter of Credit and such 
other information as shall be necessary to issue, amend or extend such 
Letter of Credit. If requested by the applicable Issuing Bank, the Borrower 
also shall submit a letter of credit application on such Issuing Banks 
standard form in connection with any request for a Letter of Credit. A 
Letter of Credit shall be issued, amended or extended only if (and upon

shall be deemed to represent and warrant that), after giving effect to such 
issuance, amendment or extension (i) the Revolving L/C Exposure shall not 
exceed the Letter of Credit Sublimit, (ii) the Revolving Facility Credit 
Exposure shall not exceed the applicable Revolving Facility Commitments and 
(iii) no Alternate Currency Letter of Credit shall be issued if, after

(or such larger amount within the Letter of Credit Sublimit as the 
Administrative Agent and the applicable Issuing Bank may agree). For the

close of business on the earlier of (i) the date one year (unless otherwise 
agreed upon by the Borrower and the Issuing Bank in their sole discretion)

any extension thereof, one year (unless otherwise agreed upon by the 
Borrower and the Issuing Bank in their sole discretion) after such renewal 
or extension) and (ii) the date that is five Business Days prior to the 
applicable Revolving Facility Maturity Date; provided, that any Letter of 
Credit with a one year tenor may provide for automatic renewal or extension 
thereof for additional one year periods (which, in no event, shall extend 
beyond the date referred to in clause (ii) of this paragraph (c)) so long 
as such Letter of Credit permits the Issuing Bank to prevent any such 
extension at least once in each twelve-month period (commencing with the 
date of issuance of such Letter of Credit) by giving prior notice to the 
beneficiary thereof within a time period during such twelve-month period to 
be agreed upon at the time such Letter of Credit is issued; provided, 
further, that if the Issuing Bank consents in its sole discretion, the 
expiration date on any Letter of Credit may extend beyond the date referred 
to in clause (ii) above, provided, that if any such Letter of Credit is 
outstanding or is issued under the Revolving Facility Commitments of any 
Class after the date that is 30 days prior to the Revolving Facility 
Maturity Date for such Class the Borrower shall provide Cash Collateral 
pursuant to documentation reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Agent 
and the relevant Issuing Bank in an amount equal to the Minimum L/C 
Collateral Amount on or prior to the date that is 30 days prior to such 
Revolving Facility Maturity Date or, if later, such date of issuance.

(d) Participations. By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment 
to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) under the Revolving 
Facility Commitments of any Class and without any further action on the 
part of the applicable Issuing Bank or the Revolving Facility Lenders, such 
Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Revolving Facility Lender under such 
Class, and each such Revolving Facility Lender hereby acquires from such 
Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such 
Revolving Facility
 
72

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lenders applicable Revolving Facility Percentage of the aggregate amount 
available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit (calculated, in the case 
of Alternate Currency Letters of Credit, based on the Dollar Equivalent 
thereof). In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each 
Revolving Facility Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to 
pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the applicable Issuing 
Bank, in Dollars, such Revolving Facility Lenders applicable Revolving 
Facility Percentage of each L/C Disbursement made by such Issuing Bank and 
not reimbursed by the Borrower on the date due as provided in paragraph (e) 
of this Section, or of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded to 
the Borrower for any reason (calculated, in the case of any Alternate 
Currency Letter of Credit, based on the Dollar Equivalent thereof). Each 
Revolving Facility Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to 
acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of 
Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any 
circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of 
any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or 
Event of Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments or the fact 
that, as a result of changes in currency exchange rates, such Revolving 
Facility Lenders Revolving Facility Credit Exposure at any time might 
exceed its Revolving Facility Commitment at such time (in which case 
Section 2.11(f) would apply), and that each such payment shall be made 
without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.

(e) Reimbursement. If the applicable Issuing Bank shall make any L/C 
Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall reimburse 
such L/C Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent an amount in 
Dollars equal to such L/C Disbursement (or, in the case of an Alternate 
Currency Letter of Credit, the Dollar Equivalent thereof) not later than 
2:00 p.m., Local Time, on the first Business Day after the Borrower 
receives notice under paragraph (g) of this Section of such L/C 
Disbursement (or the second Business Day, if such notice is received after 
12:00 noon, Local Time), together with accrued interest thereon from the 
date of such L/C Disbursement at the rate applicable to ABR Revolving 
Facility Loans of the applicable Class; provided, that the Borrower may, 
subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in 
accordance with Section 2.03 or 2.04 that such payment be financed with an 
ABR Revolving Facility Borrowing or a Swingline Borrowing of the applicable 
Class, as applicable, in an equivalent amount and, to the extent so 
financed, the Borrowers obligation to make such payment shall be 
discharged and replaced by the resulting ABR Revolving Facility Borrowing 
or Swingline Borrowing. If the Borrower fails to reimburse any L/C 
Disbursement when due, then the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify 
the applicable Issuing Bank and each other applicable Revolving Facility 
Lender of the applicable L/C Disbursement, the payment then due from the 
Borrower in respect thereof and, in the case of a Revolving Facility 
Lender, such Lenders Revolving Facility Percentage thereof. Promptly 
following receipt of such notice, each Revolving Facility Lender with a 
Revolving Facility Commitment of the applicable Class shall pay to the 
Administrative Agent in Dollars its Revolving Facility Percentage of the 
payment then due from the Borrower in the same manner as provided in 
Section 2.06 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.06 
shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Revolving 
Facility Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the 
applicable Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the Revolving 
Facility Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the Administrative Agent of 
any payment from the Borrower pursuant to this paragraph, the 
Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the applicable 
Issuing Bank or, to the extent that Revolving
 
73

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Facility Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse 
such Issuing Bank, then to such Lenders and such Issuing Bank as their 
interests may appear. Any payment made by a Revolving Facility Lender 
pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse an Issuing Bank for any L/C 
Disbursement (other than the funding of an ABR Revolving Loan or a 
Swingline Borrowing as contemplated above) shall not constitute a Loan and 
shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such L/C 
Disbursement.

(f) Obligations Absolute. The obligation of the Borrower to reimburse L/C 
Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section shall be 
absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in 
accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances 
whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability 
of any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision 
therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of 
Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any 
statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment 
by the applicable Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against 
presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply with the 
terms of such Letter of Credit or (iv) any other event or circumstance 
whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but 
for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable 
discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, the Borrowers 
obligations hereunder. Neither the Administrative Agent, the Lenders nor 
any Issuing Bank, nor any of their Related Parties, shall have any 
liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance 
or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any 
payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in 
the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or 
delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other 
communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any 
document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in 
interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes 
beyond the control of such Issuing Bank, or any of the circumstances 
referred to in clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) of the first sentence; provided, 
that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the applicable Issuing 
Bank from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as 
opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby 
waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered 
by the Borrower that are determined by final and binding decision of a 
court of competent jurisdiction to have been caused by such Issuing Banks 
failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other 
documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. 
The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence 
or willful misconduct on the part of the applicable Issuing Bank, such 
Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such 
determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the 
generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents 
presented that appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with 
the terms of a Letter of Credit, the applicable Issuing Bank may, in its 
sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without 
responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or 
information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such 
documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of 
such Letter of Credit.
 
74

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(g) Disbursement Procedures. The applicable Issuing Bank shall, promptly 
following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to 
represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. Such Issuing Bank 
shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower by 
telephone (confirmed by electronic means) of any such demand for payment 
under a Letter of Credit and whether such Issuing Bank has made or will 
make an L/C Disbursement thereunder; provided, that any failure to give or 
delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of its 
obligation to reimburse such Issuing Bank and the Revolving Facility 
Lenders with respect to any such L/C Disbursement.

(h) Interim Interest. If an Issuing Bank shall make any L/C Disbursement, 
then, unless the Borrower shall reimburse such L/C Disbursement in full on 
the date such L/C Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall 
bear interest, for each day from and including the date such L/C 
Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the Borrower reimburses 
such L/C Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR 
Revolving Loans of the applicable Class; provided, that, if such L/C 
Disbursement is not reimbursed by the Borrower when due pursuant to 
paragraph (e) of this Section, then Section 2.13(c) shall apply. Interest 
accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of the 
applicable Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date 
of payment by any Revolving Facility Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of 
this Section to reimburse such Issuing Bank shall be for the account of 
such Revolving Facility Lender to the extent of such payment.

(i) Replacement of an Issuing Bank. An Issuing Bank may be replaced at any 
time by written agreement among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the 
replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank. The Administrative 
Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of an Issuing Bank. 
At the time any such replacement shall become effective, the Borrower shall 
pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced Issuing Bank 
pursuant to Section 2.12. From and after the effective date of any such 
replacement, (i) the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and 
obligations of the replaced Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect 
to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii) references herein to 
the term Issuing Bank shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to 
any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all previous Issuing 
Banks, as the context shall require. After the replacement of an Issuing 
Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and 
shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of such Issuing Bank 
under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior 
to such replacement but shall not be required to issue additional Letters 
of Credit.

(j) Cash Collateralization Following Certain Events. If and when the 
Borrower is required to Cash Collateralize any Revolving L/C Exposure 
relating to any outstanding Letters of Credit pursuant to any of Section 
2.05(c), 2.11(e), 2.11(f), 2.11(g), 2.22(a)(v) or 7.01, the Borrower shall 
deposit in an account with or at the direction of the Collateral Agent, in 
the name of the Collateral Agent and for the benefit of the Lenders, an 
amount in cash in Dollars equal to the Revolving L/C Exposure as of such 
date (or, in the case of Sections 2.05(c), 2.11(e), 2.11(f) and 2.22(a)(v), 
the portion thereof required by such sections). Each deposit of Cash 
Collateral (x) made pursuant to this paragraph or (y) made by the 
Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 2.22(a)(ii), in each case, shall 
be held by the Collateral Agent as collateral for the payment and 
performance of the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement. The 
Collateral Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the
 
75

------------------------------------------------------------------------
exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account. Other than any interest 
earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made 
at the option and sole discretion of (i) for so long as an Event of Default 
shall be continuing, the Collateral Agent and (ii) at any other time, the 
Borrower, in each case, in Permitted Investments and at the risk and 
expense of the Borrower, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or 
profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. 
Moneys in such account shall be applied by the Collateral Agent to 
reimburse each Issuing Bank for L/C Disbursements for which such Issuing 
Bank has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be 
held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Borrower 
for the Revolving L/C Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the 
Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of Lenders with 
Revolving L/C Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total Revolving 
L/C Exposure), be applied to satisfy other obligations of the Borrower 
under this Agreement. If the Borrower is required to provide an amount of 
Cash Collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of 
Default or the existence of a Defaulting Lender or the occurrence of a 
limit under Section 2.11(e) or (f) being exceeded, such amount (to the 
extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Borrower within 
three Business Days after all Events of Default have been cured or waived 
or the termination of the Defaulting Lender status or the limits under 
Sections 2.11(e) and (f) no longer being exceeded, as applicable.

(k) Cash Collateralization Following Termination of the Revolving Facility
. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in the event of the 
prepayment in full of all outstanding Revolving Facility Loans and the 
termination of all Revolving Facility Commitments (a Revolving Facility 
Termination Event) in connection with which the Borrower notifies any one 
or more Issuing Banks that it intends to maintain one or more Letters of 
Credit initially issued under this Agreement in effect after the date of 
such Facility Termination Event (each, a Continuing Letter of Credit), 
then the security interest of the Collateral Agent in the Collateral under 
the Security Documents may be terminated in accordance with Section 9.18 if 
each such Continuing Letter of Credit is Cash Collateralized in an amount 
equal to the Minimum L/C Collateral Amount, which shall be deposited with 
or at the direction of each such Issuing Bank.

(l) Additional Issuing Banks. From time to time, the Borrower may by notice 
to the Administrative Agent designate any Lender (in addition to the 
initial Issuing Bank) each of which agrees (in its sole discretion) to act 
in such capacity and is reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent 
as an Issuing Bank. Each such additional Issuing Bank shall execute a 
counterpart of this Agreement upon the approval of the Administrative Agent 
(which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) and shall thereafter be 
an Issuing Bank hereunder for all purposes.

(m) Reporting. Unless otherwise requested by the Administrative Agent, each 
Issuing Bank shall (i) provide to the Administrative Agent copies of any 
notice received from the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.05(b) no later than 
the next Business Day after receipt thereof and (ii) report in writing to 
the Administrative Agent (A) on or prior to each Business Day on which such 
Issuing Bank expects to issue, amend or extend any Letter of Credit, the 
date of such issuance, amendment or extension, and the aggregate face 
amount of the Letters of Credit to be issued, amended or extended by it and 
outstanding after giving effect to
 
76

------------------------------------------------------------------------
such issuance, amendment or extension occurred (and whether the amount 
thereof changed), and the Issuing Bank shall be permitted to issue, amend 
or extend such Letter of Credit if the Administrative Agent shall not have 
advised the Issuing Bank that such issuance, amendment or extension would 
not be in conformity with the requirements of this Agreement, (B) on each 
Business Day on which such Issuing Bank makes any L/C Disbursement, the 
date of such L/C Disbursement and the amount of such L/C Disbursement and 
(C) on any other Business Day, such other information with respect to the 
outstanding Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank as the 
Administrative Agent shall reasonably request.

Section 2.06 Funding of Borrowings. (a) Each Lender shall make each Loan to 
be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of 
immediately available funds by 12:00 noon, Local Time, to the account of 
the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by 
notice to the Lenders; provided, that Swingline Loans shall be made as 
provided in Section 2.04. The Administrative Agent will make such Loans 
available to the Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in 
like funds, to an account of the Borrower as specified in the applicable 
Borrowing Request; provided, that ABR Revolving Loans and Swingline 
Borrowings made to finance the reimbursement of a L/C Disbursement and 
reimbursements as provided in Section 2.05(e) shall be remitted by the 
Administrative Agent to the applicable Issuing Bank.

(b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a 
Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will 
not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lenders share of such 
Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made 
such share available on such date in accordance with clause (a) of this 
Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the 
Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact 
made its share of the Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then 
the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the 
Administrative Agent forthwith on demand (without duplication) such 
corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including 
the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the 
date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of a 
payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of (A) the Federal Funds 
Effective Rate and (B) a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in 
accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation or (ii) in 
the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate 
applicable to ABR Loans at such time. If the Borrower and such Lender shall 
pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an 
overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the 
Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period. 
If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such 
amount shall constitute such Lenders Loan included in such Borrowing. Any 
payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the 
Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such 
payment to the Administrative Agent.

(c) The foregoing notwithstanding, the Administrative Agent, in its sole 
discretion, may from its own funds make a Revolving Facility Loan on behalf 
of the Lenders (including by means of Swingline Loans to the Borrower). In 
such event, the applicable Lenders on behalf of whom the Administrative 
Agent made the Revolving Facility Loan shall
 
77

------------------------------------------------------------------------
reimburse the Administrative Agent for all or any portion of such Revolving 
Facility Loan made on its behalf upon written notice given to each 
applicable Lender not later than 2:00 p.m., Local Time, on the Business Day 
such reimbursement is requested. The entire amount of interest attributable 
to such Revolving Facility Loan for the period from and including the date 
on which such Revolving Facility Loan was made on such Lenders behalf to 
but excluding the date the Administrative Agent is reimbursed in respect of 
such Revolving Facility Loan by such Lender shall be paid to the 
Administrative Agent for its own account.

Section 2.07 Interest Elections. (a) Each Borrowing initially shall be of 
the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of 
a Eurocurrency Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as 
specified in such Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the Borrower may elect to 
convert such Borrowing to a different Type or to continue such Borrowing 
and, in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods 
therefor, all as provided in this Section. The Borrower may elect different 
options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in 
which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders 
holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each 
such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing. This Section shall 
not apply to Swingline Borrowings, which may not be converted into or 
continued as Eurocurrency Borrowings.

(b) To make an election pursuant to this Section, the Borrower shall notify 
the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone, by the time that a 
Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the Borrower were 
requesting a Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made 
on the effective date of such election. Each such telephonic Interest 
Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by 
hand delivery or electronic means to the Administrative Agent of a written 
Interest Election Request in the form of Exhibit E and signed by the 
Borrower.

(c) Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall specify the 
following information in compliance with Section 2.02:

(i) the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if 
different options are being elected with respect to different portions 
thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing 
(in which case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) 
and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing);

(ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest 
Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;

(iii) whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a 
Eurocurrency Borrowing; and

(iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurocurrency Borrowing, the Interest 
Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such election, which 
shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term Interest 
Period.
 
78

------------------------------------------------------------------------
If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurocurrency Borrowing but 
does not specify an Interest Period, then the Borrower shall be deemed to 
have selected an Interest Period of one months duration. If less than all 
the outstanding principal amount of any Borrowing shall be converted or 
continued, then each resulting Borrowing shall be in an integral multiple 
of the Borrowing Multiple and not less than the Borrowing Minimum and 
satisfy the limitations specified in Sections 2.02(c) regarding the maximum 
number of Borrowings of the relevant Type.

(d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the 
Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender to which such Interest 
Election Request relates of the details thereof and of such Lenders 
portion of each resulting Borrowing.

(e) If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request 
with respect to a Eurocurrency Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest 
Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as 
provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be 
converted to an ABR Borrowing. Notwithstanding any contrary provision 
hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the 
Administrative Agent, at the written request (including a request through 
electronic means) of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Borrower, then, 
so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Borrowing 
may be converted to or continued as a Eurocurrency Borrowing and (ii) 
unless repaid, each Eurocurrency Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR 
Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto.

Section 2.08 Termination and Reduction of Commitments. (a) Unless 
previously terminated, the Revolving Facility Commitments of each Class 
shall terminate on the applicable Revolving Facility Maturity Date for such 
Class. On the Closing Date (after giving effect to the funding of the Term 
B Loans to be made on such date), the Term B Loan Commitments of each 
Lender as of the Closing Date will terminate.

(b) The Borrower may at any time terminate, or from time to time reduce, 
the Revolving Facility Commitments of any Class; provided, that (i) each 
reduction of the Revolving Facility Commitments of any Class shall be in an 
amount that is an integral multiple of $500,000 and not less than 
$1,000,000 (or, if less, the remaining amount of the Revolving Facility 
Commitments of such Class) and (ii) the Borrower shall not terminate or 
reduce the Revolving Facility Commitments of any Class if, after giving 
effect to any concurrent prepayment of the Revolving Facility Loans in 
accordance with Section 2.11 and any Cash Collateralization of Letters of 
Credit in accordance with Section 2.05(j) or (k), the Revolving Facility 
Credit Exposure of such Class (excluding any Cash Collateralized Letter of 
Credit) would exceed the total Revolving Facility Commitments of such 
Class.

(c) The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election to 
terminate or reduce the Revolving Facility Commitments of any Class under 
paragraph (b) of this Section 2.08 at least three Business Days prior to 
the effective date of such termination or reduction (or such shorter period 
acceptable to the Administrative Agent), specifying such election and the 
effective date thereof. Promptly following receipt of any notice, the 
Administrative Agent shall advise the applicable Lenders of the contents 
thereof. Each notice delivered by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 
2.08 shall be irrevocable; provided,
 
79

------------------------------------------------------------------------
that a notice of termination or reduction of the Revolving Facility 
Commitments of any Class delivered by the Borrower may state that such 
notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, 
indentures or similar agreements or other transactions, in which case such 
notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative 
Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not 
satisfied. Any termination or reduction of the Commitments shall be 
permanent. Each reduction of the Commitments of any Class shall be made 
ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments 
of such Class.

Section 2.09 Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt. (a) The Borrower hereby 
unconditionally promises to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the 
account of each Revolving Facility Lender the then unpaid principal amount 
of each Revolving Facility Loan to the Borrower on the Revolving Facility 
Maturity Date applicable to such Revolving Facility Loans, (ii) to the 
Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender the then unpaid 
principal amount of each Term Loan of such Lender as provided in Section 
2.10 and (iii) to the Swingline Lender the then unpaid principal amount of 
each Swingline Loan applicable to any Class of Revolving Facility 
Commitments on the earlier of the Revolving Facility Maturity Date for such 
Class and the first date after such Swingline Loan is made that is the 15th 
or last day of a calendar month and is at least five Business Days after 
such Swingline Loan is made; provided, that on each date that a Revolving 
Facility Borrowing is made by the Borrower, the Borrower shall repay all 
Swingline Loans then outstanding.

(b) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an 
account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such 
Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts 
of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time 
hereunder.

(c) The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall 
record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Facility and Type 
thereof and the Interest Period (if any) applicable thereto, (ii) the 
amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and 
payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) any amount 
received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the 
Lenders and each Lenders share thereof.

(d) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to clause (b) or 
(c) of this Section shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and 
amounts of the obligations recorded therein; provided, that the failure of 
any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any 
error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower 
to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

(e) Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be evidenced by a 
promissory note (a Note). In such event, the Borrower shall prepare, 
execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to such Lender 
(or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered 
assigns) and in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and reasonably 
acceptable to the Borrower. Thereafter, unless otherwise agreed to by the 
applicable Lender, the Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest 
thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 
9.04) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable 
to the payee named therein (or, if requested by such payee, to such payee 
and its registered assigns).
 
80

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Section 2.10 Repayment of Term Loans and Revolving Facility Loans. (a) 
Subject to the other clauses of this Section,

(i) the Borrower shall repay Term B Loans extended on the Closing Date on 
the last day of each March, June, September and December of each year 
(commencing on the last day of the first full fiscal quarter of the 
Borrower ending after the Closing Date) and on the applicable Term Facility 
Maturity Date or, if such date is not a Business Day, on the next preceding 
Business Day (each such date being referred to as a Term B Loan 
Installment Date), in an aggregate principal amount of such Term B Loans 
equal to (A) in the case of quarterly payments due prior to the applicable 
Term Facility Maturity Date, an amount equal to 0.25% of the aggregate 
principal amount of such Term B Loans outstanding immediately after the 
Closing Date, and (B) in the case of such payment due on the applicable 
Term Facility Maturity Date, an amount equal to the then unpaid principal 
amount of such Term B Loans outstanding;

(ii) in the event that any Incremental Term Loans are made, the Borrower 
shall repay such Incremental Term Loans on the dates and in the amounts set 
forth in the related Incremental Assumption Agreement (each such date being 
referred to as an Incremental Term Loan Installment Date); and

(iii) to the extent not previously paid, outstanding Term Loans shall be 
due and payable on the applicable Term Facility Maturity Date.

(b) To the extent not previously paid, outstanding Revolving Facility Loans 
shall be due and payable on the applicable Revolving Facility Maturity 
Date.

(c) Prepayment of the Loans from:

(i) all Net Proceeds pursuant to Section 2.11(b) and Excess Cash Flow 
pursuant to Section 2.11(c) shall be allocated to the Class or Classes of 
Term Loans determined pursuant to Section 2.10(d), with the application 
thereof to reduce in direct order amounts due on the succeeding Term Loan 
Installment Dates under such Classes as provided in the remaining scheduled 
amortization payments under such Classes; provided, that any Lender, at its 
option, may elect to decline any such prepayment of any Term Loan held by 
it if it shall give written notice to the Administrative Agent thereof by 
5:00 p.m. Local Time at least three Business Days prior to the date of such 
prepayment (any such Lender, a Declining Lender) and on the date of any 
such prepayment, any amounts that would otherwise have been applied to 
prepay Term Loans owing to Declining Lenders shall instead be retained by 
the Borrower for application for any purpose not prohibited by this 
Agreement, and

(ii) any optional prepayments of the Term Loans pursuant to Section 2.11(a) 
shall be applied to the remaining installments of the Term Loans under the 
applicable Class or Classes as the Borrower may in each case direct.
 
81

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(d) Any mandatory prepayment of Term Loans pursuant to Section 2.11(b) or 
(c) shall be applied so that the aggregate amount of such prepayment is 
allocated among the Term B Loans and the Other Term Loans, if any, pro rata 
based on the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Term B Loans and 
Other Term Loans, if any; provided that, subject to the pro rata 
application to Loans outstanding within any Class of Term Loans, the 
Borrower may allocate such prepayment in its discretion among the Class or 
Classes of Term Loans as the Borrower may specify (so long as the Term B 
Loans incurred on the Closing Date are allocated at least their pro rata 
share of such prepayment). Prior to any prepayment of any Loan under any 
Facility hereunder, the Borrower shall select the Borrowing or Borrowings 
under the applicable Facility to be prepaid and shall notify the 
Administrative Agent by telephone (confirmed by electronic means) of such 
selection not later than 2:00 p.m., Local Time, (i) in the case of an ABR 
Borrowing, at least one Business Day before the scheduled date of such 
prepayment and (ii) in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, at least three 
Business Days before the scheduled date of such prepayment (or, in each 
case such shorter period acceptable to the Administrative Agent); provided
, that a notice of prepayment may state that such notice is conditioned 
upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, indentures or similar 
agreements or other transactions, in which case such notice may be revoked 
by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the 
specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied. Each 
repayment of a Borrowing (x) in the case of the Revolving Facility of any 
Class, shall be applied to the Revolving Facility Loans included in the 
repaid Borrowing such that each Revolving Facility Lender receives its 
ratable share of such repayment (based upon the respective Revolving 
Facility Credit Exposures of the Revolving Facility Lenders of such Class 
at the time of such repayment) and (y) in all other cases, shall be applied 
ratably to the Loans included in the repaid Borrowing. All repayments of 
Loans shall be accompanied by accrued interest on the amount repaid to the 
extent required by Section 2.13(d).

Section 2.11 Prepayment of Loans. (a) The Borrower shall have the right at 
any time and from time to time to prepay any Loan in whole or in part, 
without premium or penalty (but subject to Section 2.16), in an aggregate 
principal amount that is an integral multiple of the Borrowing Multiple and 
not less than the Borrowing Minimum or, if less, the amount outstanding, 
subject to prior notice in accordance with Section 2.10(d) ; provided, 
that:

(i) in the event of any optional prepayment of the Term B Loans pursuant to 
this Section 2.11(a) made prior to the first anniversary of the Closing 
Date, the Borrower shall pay to the applicable Lender with respect to such 
Term B Loans the Applicable Premium with respect to such Term B Loans on 
the date of such prepayment;

(ii) in the event of any optional prepayments of the Term B Loans pursuant 
to this Section 2.11(a) made on or after the first anniversary of the 
Closing Date and prior to the second anniversary of the Closing Date, the 
Borrower shall pay to the applicable Lenders with respect to such Term B 
Loans a prepayment premium equal to 2% of the aggregate principal amount of 
the Term B Loans so prepaid;

(iii) in the event of any optional prepayments of the Term B Loans pursuant 
to this Section 2.11(a) made on or after the second anniversary of the 
Closing Date and prior to the third anniversary of the Closing Date, the 
Borrower shall pay to the applicable Lenders with respect to such Term B 
Loans a prepayment premium equal to 1% of the aggregate principal amount of 
the Term B Loans so prepaid; and
 
82

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(iv) no premium shall be payable on any optional prepayments of the Term B 
Loans pursuant to this Section 2.11(a) made on or after the third 
anniversary of the Closing Date.

(b) The Borrower shall apply all Net Proceeds promptly upon receipt thereof 
to prepay Term Loans in accordance with clauses (c) and (d) of Section 
2.10. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrower may use a portion of such 
Net Proceeds to prepay or repurchase any Refinancing Notes that is secured 
by a pari passu Lien on the Collateral or other Indebtedness that is 
secured by pari passu Liens permitted by Section 6.02, in each case in an 
amount not to exceed the product of (x) the amount of such Net Proceeds and 
(y) a fraction, (A) the numerator of which is the outstanding principal 
amount of such Indebtedness secured by pari passu Liens and (B) the 
denominator of which is the sum of the outstanding principal amount of such 
Indebtedness and the outstanding principal amount of all Classes of Term 
Loans. Not later than five Business Days prior to the date of such 
prepayment, the Borrower shall provide written notice thereof to the 
Administrative Agent, including the amount of any required prepayment.

(c) Not later than 5 Business Days after the date on which the annual 
financial statements are, or are required to be, delivered under Section 
5.04(a) with respect to each Excess Cash Flow Period, the Borrower shall 
calculate Excess Cash Flow for such Excess Cash Flow Period and, if and to 
the extent the amount of such Excess Cash Flow exceeds $3,000,000 (the 
ECF Threshold Amount), the Borrower shall apply an amount equal to (i) the 
Required Percentage of such excess portion of such Excess Cash Flow minus 
(ii) to the extent not financed using the proceeds of the incurrence of 
funded term Indebtedness, the sum of (A) the amount of any voluntary 
prepayments during such Excess Cash Flow Period (plus, without duplication 
of any amounts previously deducted under this clause (A), the amount of any 
voluntary prepayments after the end of such Excess Cash Flow Period but 
before the date of prepayment under this clause (c)) of Term Loans (it 
being understood that the amount of any such prepayment constituting a 
below-par Permitted Loan Purchase shall be calculated to equal the amount 
of cash used and not the principal amount deemed prepaid therewith) and (B) 
the amount of any permanent voluntary reductions during such Excess Cash 
Flow Period (plus, without duplication of any amounts previously deducted 
under this clause (B), the amount of any permanent voluntary reductions 
after the end of such Excess Cash Flow Period but before the date of 
prepayment under this clause (c)) of Revolving Facility Commitments to the 
extent that an equal amount of Revolving Facility Loans were simultaneously 
repaid, to prepay Term Loans in accordance with clauses (c) and (d) of 
Section 2.10. Such calculation will be set forth in a certificate signed by 
a Financial Officer of the Borrower delivered to the Administrative Agent, 
setting forth the amount, if any, of Excess Cash Flow for such fiscal year, 
the amount of any required prepayment in respect thereof and the 
calculation thereof in reasonable detail.

(d) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section 2.11 to the 
contrary, (i) to the extent that any Net Proceeds of any Asset Sale by a 
Foreign Subsidiary or Excess Cash Flow attributable to a Foreign Subsidiary 
would otherwise be required to be applied
 
83

------------------------------------------------------------------------
pursuant to Section 2.11(b) or Section 2.11(c) but is prohibited or delayed 
by applicable local law from being repatriated to the United States of 
America, the portion of such Net Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow so affected 
will not be required to be applied to repay Term Loans at the times 
provided in Section 2.11(b) or Section 2.11(c) but may be retained by the 
applicable Foreign Subsidiary so long, but only so long, as the applicable 
local law will not permit repatriation to the United States of America (the 
Borrower hereby agreeing to cause the applicable Foreign Subsidiary to 
promptly use commercially reasonable efforts to take all actions reasonably 
required by the applicable local law to permit such repatriation), and once 
such repatriation of any of such affected Net Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow 
that was otherwise required to be applied pursuant to Section 2.11(b) or 
Section 2.11(c) is permitted under the applicable local law, such 
repatriation will be effected and such repatriated Net Proceeds or Excess 
Cash Flow will be promptly applied (net of additional taxes payable or 
reserved against as a result thereof) to the repayment of the Term Loans 
pursuant to Section 2.11(b) or Section 2.11(c), to the extent provided 
therein and (ii) to the extent that the Borrower has determined in good 
faith that repatriation of any or all of such Net Proceeds or Excess Cash 
Flow that would otherwise be required to be applied pursuant to Section 
2.11(b) or Section 2.11(c) would have a material adverse tax cost 
consequence if so repatriated, the Net Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow so 
affected may be retained by the applicable Foreign Subsidiary (the Borrower 
hereby agreeing to cause the applicable Subsidiary to promptly use 
commercially reasonable efforts to take all actions that are reasonably 
required to eliminate such tax effects); provided, that in the case of this 
clause (ii), on or before the date on which any Net Proceeds or Excess Cash 
Flow so retained would otherwise have been required to be applied to 
prepayments pursuant to Section 2.11(b) or Section 2.11(c), (x) the 
Borrower applies an amount equal to such Net Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow 
to such prepayments as if such Net Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow had been 
received by the Borrower rather than such Foreign Subsidiary, less the 
amount of additional taxes that would have been payable or reserved against 
if such Net Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow had been repatriated (or, if less, 
Net Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow that would be calculated if received by 
such Foreign Subsidiary) or (y) such Net Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow is 
applied to the permanent repayment of Indebtedness of a Foreign Subsidiary.

(e) In the event that the aggregate amount of Revolving Facility Credit 
Exposure of any Class exceeds the total Revolving Facility Commitments of 
such Class, the Borrower shall prepay Revolving Facility Borrowings or 
Swingline Borrowings of such Class (or, if no such Borrowings are 
outstanding, provide Cash Collateral in respect of outstanding Letters of 
Credit pursuant to Section 2.05(j)) in an aggregate amount equal to such 
excess.

(f) In the event that the Revolving L/C Exposure exceeds the Letter of 
Credit Sublimit, at the request of the Administrative Agent, the Borrower 
shall provide Cash Collateral pursuant to Section 2.05(j) in an amount 
equal to such excess.

(g) If as a result of changes in currency exchange rates, on any 
Revaluation Date, (i) the total Revolving Facility Credit Exposure of any 
Class exceeds the total Revolving Facility Commitments of such Class, (ii) 
the Revolving L/C Exposure exceeds the Letter of Credit Sublimit or (iii) 
the Revolving L/C Exposure with respect to all Alternate Currency Letters 
of Credit exceeds $3,000,000 (or such larger amount within the Letter of 
Credit Sublimit as the Administrative Agent and the applicable Issuing Bank 
may agree), the Borrower
 
84

------------------------------------------------------------------------
shall, at the request of the Administrative Agent, within ten (10) days of 
such Revaluation Date (A) prepay Revolving Facility Borrowings or Swingline 
Borrowings or (B) provide Cash Collateral pursuant to Section 2.05(j), in 
an aggregate amount such that the applicable exposure does not exceed the 
applicable commitment, sublimit or amount set forth above.

Section 2.12 Fees. (a) The Borrower agrees to pay to each Lender (other 
than any Defaulting Lender), through the Administrative Agent, on the last 
Business Day of March, June, September and December in each year and on the 
date on which the Revolving Facility Commitments of all the Lenders shall 
be terminated as provided herein, a commitment fee (a Commitment Fee) on 
the daily amount of the applicable Available Unused Commitment of such 
Lender during the preceding quarter (or other period commencing with the 
Closing Date or ending with the date on which the last of the Commitments 
of such Lender shall be terminated) at a rate equal to the Applicable 
Commitment Fee. All Commitment Fees shall be computed on the basis of the 
actual number of days elapsed in a year of 360 days. For the purpose of 
calculating any Lenders Commitment Fee, the outstanding Swingline Loans 
during the period for which such Lenders Commitment Fee is calculated 
shall be deemed to be zero. The Commitment Fee due to each Lender shall 
commence to accrue on the Closing Date and shall cease to accrue on the 
date on which the last of the Commitments of such Lender shall be 
terminated as provided herein.

(b) The Borrower from time to time agrees to pay (i) to each Revolving 
Facility Lender of each Class (other than any Defaulting Lender), through 
the Administrative Agent, on the last Business Day of March, June, 
September and December of each year and on the date on which the Revolving 
Facility Commitments of all the Lenders shall be terminated as provided 
herein, a fee in Dollars (an L/C Participation Fee) on such Lenders 
Revolving Facility Percentage of the daily aggregate Revolving L/C Exposure 
(excluding the portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed L/C 
Disbursements) of such Class, during the preceding quarter (or shorter 
period commencing with the Closing Date or ending with the Revolving 
Facility Maturity Date or the date on which the Revolving Facility 
Commitments of such Class shall be terminated) at the rate per annum equal 
to the Applicable Margin for Eurocurrency Revolving Facility Borrowings of 
such Class effective for each day in such period, and (ii) to each Issuing 
Bank, for its own account (x) the last Business Day of March, June, 
September and December of each year and on the date on which the Revolving 
Facility Commitments of all the Lenders shall be terminated, a fronting fee 
in respect of each Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank for the 
period from and including the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit to 
and including the termination of such Letter of Credit, computed at a rate 
equal to 1/8 of 1% per annum of the daily stated amount of such Letter of 
Credit), plus (y) in connection with the issuance, amendment or transfer of 
any such Letter of Credit or any L/C Disbursement thereunder, such Issuing 
Banks customary documentary and processing fees and charges (collectively, 
Issuing Bank Fees). All L/C Participation Fees and Issuing Bank Fees that 
are payable on a per annum basis shall be computed on the basis of the 
actual number of days elapsed in a year of 360 days.

(c) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account 
of the Administrative Agent, the Senior Facilities Administration Fee as 
set forth in the Fee Letter, as amended, restated, supplemented or 
otherwise modified from time to time, at the times specified therein (the 
Administrative Agent Fees).
 
85

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(d) All Fees shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately available 
funds, to the Administrative Agent for distribution, if and as appropriate, 
among the Lenders, except that Issuing Bank Fees shall be paid directly to 
the applicable Issuing Banks. Once paid, none of the Fees shall be 
refundable under any circumstances.

Section 2.13 Interest. (a) The Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing 
(including each Swingline Loan) shall bear interest at the ABR plus the 
Applicable Margin.

(b) The Loans comprising each Eurocurrency Borrowing shall bear interest at 
the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing 
plus the Applicable Margin.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest on any 
Loan or any Fees or other amount payable by the Borrower hereunder is not 
paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, 
such overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, 
at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal of any 
Loan, 2% plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided in the 
preceding clauses of this Section 2.13 or (ii) in the case of any other 
overdue amount, 2% plus the rate applicable to ABR Loans as provided in 
clause (a) of this Section; provided, that this clause (c) shall not apply 
to any Event of Default that has been waived by the Lenders pursuant to 
Section 9.08.

(d) Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears (i) on each 
Interest Payment Date for such Loan, (ii) in the case of Revolving Facility 
Loans, upon termination of the applicable Revolving Facility Commitments 
and (iii) in the case of the Term Loans, on the applicable Term Facility 
Maturity Date; provided, that (A) interest accrued pursuant to clause (c) 
of this Section 2.13 shall be payable on demand, (B) in the event of any 
repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than a prepayment of a Revolving 
Facility Loan that is an ABR Loan that is not made in conjunction with a 
permanent commitment reduction), accrued interest on the principal amount 
repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or 
prepayment and (C) in the event of any conversion of any Eurocurrency Loan 
prior to the end of the current Interest Period therefor, accrued interest 
on such Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion.

(e) All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 
days, except that interest computed by reference to the ABR at times when 
the ABR is based on the Prime Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year 
of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and in each case shall be payable 
for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but 
excluding the last day). The applicable ABR, Adjusted LIBO Rate or LIBO 
Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such 
determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
 
86

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Section 2.14 Alternate Rate of Interest. If prior to the commencement of 
any Interest Period for a Eurocurrency Borrowing:

(a) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be 
conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not 
exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period; or

(b) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that the 
Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly 
reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining their Loans 
included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;

then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and 
the Lenders by telephone or electronic means as promptly as practicable 
thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and 
the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer 
exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of 
any Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing as, a Eurocurrency 
Borrowing shall be ineffective and such Borrowing shall be converted to or 
continued as on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto an 
ABR Borrowing, and (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurocurrency 
Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing.

Section 2.15 Increased Costs. (a) If any Change in Law shall:

(i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or 
similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, 
or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement 
reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate) or Issuing Bank; or

(ii) subject any Lender to any Tax with respect to any Loan Document (other 
than (i) Taxes indemnifiable under Section 2.17 or (ii) Excluded Taxes); or

(iii) impose on any Lender or Issuing Bank or the London interbank market 
any other condition affecting this Agreement or Eurocurrency Loans made by 
such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to 
such Lender of making or maintaining any Eurocurrency Loan (or of 
maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost 
to such Lender or Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or maintaining 
any Letter of Credit or to reduce the amount of any sum received or 
receivable by such Lender or Issuing Bank hereunder (whether of principal, 
interest or otherwise), then the Borrower will pay to such Lender or 
Issuing Bank, as applicable, such additional amount or amounts as will 
compensate such Lender or Issuing Bank, as applicable, for such additional 
costs incurred or reduction suffered.

(b) If any Lender or Issuing Bank determines that any Change in Law 
regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the 
rate of return on such Lenders or Issuing Banks capital or on the capital 
of such Lenders or Issuing Banks holding company, if any, as a 
consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in 
Letters of Credit or Swingline Loans held by, such Lender, or the Letters 
of Credit issued by
 
87

------------------------------------------------------------------------
such Issuing Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or such Issuing 
Bank or such Lenders or such Issuing Banks holding company could have 
achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such 
Lenders or such Issuing Banks policies and the policies of such Lenders 
or such Issuing Banks holding company with respect to capital adequacy), 
then from time to time the Borrower shall pay to such Lender or such 
Issuing Bank, as applicable, such additional amount or amounts as will 
compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such Lenders or such 
Issuing Banks holding company for any such reduction suffered.

(c) A certificate of a Lender or an Issuing Bank setting forth the amount 
or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or Issuing Bank or its 
holding company, as applicable, as specified in clause (a) or (b) of this 
Section shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent 
manifest error; provided, that any such certificate claiming amounts 
described in clause (x) or (y) of the definition of Change in Law shall, 
in addition, state the basis upon which such amount has been calculated and 
certify that such Lenders or Issuing Banks demand for payment of such 
costs hereunder, and such method of allocation is not inconsistent with its 
treatment of other borrowers which, as a credit matter, are similarly 
situated to the Borrower and which are subject to similar provisions. The 
Borrower shall pay such Lender or Issuing Bank, as applicable, the amount 
shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.

(d) Promptly after any Lender or any Issuing Bank has determined that it 
will make a request for increased compensation pursuant to this Section 
2.15, such Lender or Issuing Bank shall notify the Borrower thereof. 
Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or Issuing Bank to demand 
compensation pursuant to this Section 2.15 shall not constitute a waiver of 
such Lenders or Issuing Banks right to demand such compensation; 
provided, that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or 
an Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section 2.15 for any increased costs or 
reductions incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender 
or Issuing Bank, as applicable, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law 
giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lenders or 
Issuing Banks intention to claim compensation therefor; provided, further, 
that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or 
reductions is retroactive, then the 180 day period referred to above shall 
be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.

Section 2.16 Break Funding Payments. In the event of (a) the payment of any 
principal of any Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last day of an 
Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of 
Default), (b) the conversion of any Eurocurrency Loan other than on the 
last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to 
borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Eurocurrency Loan on the date 
specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto or (d) the assignment of 
any Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period 
applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to 
Section 2.19, then, in any such event, the Borrower shall compensate each 
Lender for the loss, cost and expense attributable to such event. In the 
case of a Eurocurrency Loan, such loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall 
be deemed to be the amount determined by such Lender (it being understood 
that the deemed amount shall not exceed the actual amount) to be the 
excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest that would have accrued on 
the principal amount of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the LIBO 
Rate that would have been applicable to such Loan, for the
 
88

------------------------------------------------------------------------
period from the date of such event to the last day of the then current 
Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert 
or continue a Eurocurrency Loan, for the period that would have been the 
Interest Period for such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest that would 
accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate which 
such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, 
for deposits in Dollars of a comparable amount and period from other banks 
in the Eurocurrency market. A certificate of any Lender setting forth any 
amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this 
Section 2.16 shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive 
absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown 
as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.

Section 2.17 Taxes. (a) Any and all payments made by or on behalf of a Loan 
Party under this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be made free 
and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for or on account of, 
any Taxes; provided, that if a Loan Party, the Administrative Agent or any 
other applicable withholding agent shall be required by applicable 
Requirement of Law to deduct or withhold any Taxes from such payments, then 
(i) the applicable withholding agent shall make such deductions or 
withholdings as are reasonably determined by the applicable withholding 
agent to be required by any applicable Requirement of Law, (ii) the 
applicable withholding agent shall timely pay the full amount deducted or 
withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority within the time allowed and 
in accordance with applicable Requirement of Law, and (iii) to the extent 
withholding or deduction is required to be made on account of Indemnified 
Taxes or Other Taxes, the sum payable by the Loan Party shall be increased 
as necessary so that after all required deductions and withholdings have 
been made (including deductions or withholdings applicable to additional 
sums payable under this Section 2.17) the Administrative Agent or any 
Lender, as applicable, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have 
received had no such deductions or withholdings been made. Whenever any 
Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes are payable by a Loan Party, as promptly 
as possible thereafter, such Loan Party shall send to the Administrative 
Agent for its own account or for the account of a Lender, as the case may 
be, a certified copy of an official receipt (or other evidence acceptable 
to the Administrative Agent or such Lender, acting reasonably) received by 
the Loan Party showing payment thereof. Without duplication, after any 
payment of Taxes by any Loan Party or the Administrative Agent to a 
Governmental Authority as provided in this Section 2.17, the Borrower shall 
deliver to the Administrative Agent or the Administrative Agent shall 
deliver to the Borrower, as the case may be, a copy of a receipt issued by 
such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of any return 
required by applicable Requirements of Law to report such payment or other 
evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower or the 
Administrative Agent, as the case may be.

(b) The Borrower shall timely pay any Other Taxes.

(c) The Borrower shall indemnify and hold harmless the Administrative Agent 
and each Lender within 15 Business Days after written demand therefor, for 
the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed on the 
Administrative Agent or such Lender, as applicable, as the case may be 
(including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or 
attributable to amounts payable under this Section 2.17), and any 
reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or 
not such
 
89

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or 
asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate setting 
forth in reasonable detail the basis and calculation of the amount of such 
payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender or by the 
Administrative Agent (as applicable) on its own behalf or on behalf of a 
Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

(d) Each Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, 
at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the 
Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation 
prescribed by applicable law and such other reasonably requested 
information as will permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as the 
case may be, to determine (A) whether or not any payments made hereunder or 
under any other Loan Document are subject to withholding of Taxes, (B) if 
applicable, the required rate of withholding or deduction, and (C) such 
Lenders entitlement to any available exemption from, or reduction of, any 
such withholding of Taxes in respect of any payments to be made to such 
Lender by any Loan Party pursuant to any Loan Document or otherwise to 
establish such Lenders status for withholding tax purposes in the 
applicable jurisdiction. In addition, any Lender, if requested by the 
Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other 
documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the 
Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the 
Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to 
backup withholding or information reporting requirements.

(e) Without limiting the generality of Section 2.17(d), each Foreign Lender 
with respect to any Loan made to the Borrower shall, to the extent it is 
legally eligible to do so:

(i) deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, prior to the date 
on which the first payment to the Foreign Lender is due hereunder, two 
copies of (A) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming exemption from U.S. 
federal withholding tax under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code with 
respect to payments of portfolio interest, United States Internal Revenue 
Service Form W-8BEN (or any applicable successor form) (together with a 
certificate (substantially in the form of Exhibit I hereto, such 
certificate, the Non-Bank Tax Certificate) certifying that such Foreign 
Lender is not a bank for purposes of Section 881(c) of the Code, is not a 
10-percent shareholder (within the meaning of Section 871(h)(3)(B) of the 
Code) of the Borrower and is not a CFC related to the Borrower (within the 
meaning of Section 864(d)(4) of the Code), and that the interest payments 
in question are not effectively connected with the conduct by such Lender 
of a trade or business within the United States of America), (B) Internal 
Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or Form W-8ECI (or any applicable successor 
form), in each case properly completed and duly executed by such Foreign 
Lender claiming complete exemption from, or reduced rate of, U.S. federal 
withholding tax on payments by the Borrower under this Agreement, (C) 
Internal Revenue Service Form W-8IMY (or any applicable successor form) and 
all necessary attachments (including the forms described in clauses (A) and 
(B) above, provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership, and one or 
more of the partners is claiming portfolio interest treatment, the Non-Bank 
Tax Certificate may be provided by such Foreign Lender on behalf of such 
partners) or (D) any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for 
claiming
 
90

------------------------------------------------------------------------
exemption from or a reduction in United States federal withholding tax duly 
completed together with such supplementary documentation as may be 
prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower or the Administrative 
Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and

(ii) deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent two further 
copies of any such form or certification (or any applicable successor form) 
on or before the date that any such form or certification expires or 
becomes obsolete or invalid, after the occurrence of any event requiring a 
change in the most recent form previously delivered by it to the Borrower 
and the Administrative Agent, and from time to time thereafter if 
reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent.

Any Foreign Lender that becomes legally ineligible to update any form or 
certification previously delivered shall promptly notify the Borrower and 
the Administrative Agent in writing of such Foreign Lenders inability to 
do so.

Each person that shall become a Participant pursuant to Section 9.04 or a 
Lender pursuant to Section 9.04 shall, upon the effectiveness of the 
related transfer, be required to provide all the forms and statements 
required pursuant to this Section 2.17(e); provided, that a Participant 
shall furnish all such required forms and statements to the person from 
which the related participation shall have been purchased.

In addition, each Agent shall deliver to the Borrower (x)(I) prior to the 
date on which the first payment by the Borrower is due hereunder or (II) 
prior to the first date on or after the date on which such Agent becomes a 
successor Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 8.09 on which payment by 
the Borrower is due hereunder, as applicable, two copies of a properly 
completed and executed IRS Form W-9 certifying its exemption from U.S. 
federal backup withholding or such other properly completed and executed 
documentation prescribed by applicable law certifying its entitlement to an 
available exemption from applicable U.S. federal withholding taxes in 
respect of any payments to be made to such Agent by any Loan Party pursuant 
to any Loan Document including, as applicable, an IRS Form W-8IMY 
certifying that the Agent is a U.S. branch and intends to be treated as a 
U.S. person for purposes of withholding under Chapter 3 of the Code 
pursuant to Section 1.1441-1(b)(2)(iv) of the Treasury Regulations, and (y) 
on or before the date on which any such previously delivered documentation 
expires or becomes obsolete or invalid, after the occurrence of any event 
requiring a change in the most recent documentation previously delivered by 
it to the Borrower, and from time to time if reasonably requested by the 
Borrower, two further copies of such documentation.

(f) If any Lender or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, determines, 
in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of an Indemnified Tax 
or Other Tax for which a payment has been made by a Loan Party pursuant to 
this Agreement or any other Loan Document, which refund in the good faith 
judgment of such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, is 
attributable to such payment made by such Loan Party, then the Lender or 
the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, shall reimburse the Loan 
Party for such amount (net of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of such 
Lender or the Administrative
 
91

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Agent, as the case may be, and without interest other than any interest 
received thereon from the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to 
such refund) as the Lender or Administrative Agent, as the case may be, 
determines in its sole discretion to be the proportion of the refund as 
will leave it, after such reimbursement, in no better or worse position 
(taking into account expenses or any Taxes imposed on the refund) than it 
would have been in if the Indemnified Tax or Other Tax giving rise to such 
refund had not been imposed in the first instance; provided, that the Loan 
Party, upon the request of the Lender or the Administrative Agent agrees to 
repay the amount paid over to the Loan Party (plus any penalties, interest 
or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the 
Lender or the Administrative Agent in the event the Lender or the 
Administrative Agent is required to repay such refund to such Governmental 
Authority. In such event, such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the 
case may be, shall, at the Borrowers request, provide the Borrower with a 
copy of any notice of assessment or other evidence of the requirement to 
repay such refund received from the relevant Governmental Authority (
provided, that such Lender or the Administrative Agent may delete any 
information therein that it deems confidential). A Lender or the 
Administrative Agent shall claim any refund that it determines is available 
to it, unless it concludes in its sole discretion that it would be 
adversely affected by making such a claim. No Lender nor the Administrative 
Agent shall be obliged to make available its tax returns (or any other 
information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to any Loan 
Party in connection with this clause (f) or any other provision of this 
Section 2.17.

(g) If the Borrower determines that a reasonable basis exists for 
contesting an Indemnified Tax or Other Tax for which a Loan Party has paid 
additional amounts or indemnification payments, each affected Lender or 
Agent, as the case may be, shall use reasonable efforts to cooperate with 
the Borrower as the Borrower may reasonably request in challenging such 
Tax. The Borrower shall indemnify and hold each Lender and Agent harmless 
against any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such person in connection 
with any request made by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.17(g). 
Nothing in this Section 2.17(g) shall obligate any Lender or Agent to take 
any action that such person, in its sole judgment, determines may result in 
a material detriment to such person.

(h) Each U.S. Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative 
Agent two Internal Revenue Service Forms W-9 (or substitute or successor 
form), properly completed and duly executed, certifying that such U.S. 
Lender is exempt from United States federal backup withholding (i) on or 
prior to the Closing Date (or on or prior to the date it becomes a party to 
this Agreement), (ii) on or before the date that such form expires or 
becomes obsolete or invalid, (iii) after the occurrence of a change in the 
U.S. Lenders circumstances requiring a change in the most recent form 
previously delivered by it to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, 
and (iv) from time to time thereafter if reasonably requested by the 
Borrower or the Administrative Agent.

(i) If a payment made to any Lender or any Agent under this Agreement or 
any other Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax 
imposed by FATCA if such Lender or such Agent were to fail to comply with 
the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained 
in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender or 
such Agent shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at 
the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably 
requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation 
prescribed by
 
92

------------------------------------------------------------------------
applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the 
Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the 
Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower 
and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA, 
to determine whether such Lender has or has not complied with such Lenders 
obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount, if any, to deduct and 
withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this Section 2.17(i), 
FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this 
Agreement.

(j) The agreements in this Section 2.17 shall survive the termination of 
this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable 
under any Loan Document.

For purposes of this Section 2.17, the term Lender includes any Issuing 
Bank and the term applicable Requirement of Law includes FATCA.

Section 2.18 Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs. 
(a) Unless otherwise specified, the Borrower shall make each payment 
required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees 
or reimbursement of L/C Disbursements, or of amounts payable under Sections 
2.15, 2.16 or 2.17, or otherwise) prior to 2:00 p.m., Local Time, on the 
date when due, in immediately available funds, without condition or 
deduction for any defense, recoupment, set-off or counterclaim. Any amounts 
received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the 
Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next 
succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All 
such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent to the applicable 
account designated to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent, except 
payments to be made directly to the applicable Issuing Bank or the 
Swingline Lender as expressly provided herein and except that payments 
pursuant to Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.05 shall be made directly to 
the persons entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any 
such payments received by it for the account of any other person to the 
appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. Except as 
otherwise expressly provided herein, if any payment hereunder shall be due 
on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended 
to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment 
accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such 
extension. All payments made under the Loan Documents shall be made in 
Dollars. Any payment required to be made by the Administrative Agent 
hereunder shall be deemed to have been made by the time required if the 
Administrative Agent shall, at or before such time, have taken the 
necessary steps to make such payment in accordance with the regulations or 
operating procedures of the clearing or settlement system used by the 
Administrative Agent to make such payment.

(b) Subject to Section 7.02, if at any time insufficient funds are received 
by and available to the Administrative Agent from the Borrower to pay fully 
all amounts of principal, unreimbursed L/C Disbursements, interest and fees 
then due from the Borrower hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) 
first, towards payment of interest and fees then due from the Borrower 
hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with 
the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, (ii) second, 
towards payment of principal of Swingline Loans and unreimbursed L/C 
Disbursements then due from the Borrower
 
93

------------------------------------------------------------------------
hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with 
the amounts of principal and unreimbursed L/C Disbursements then due to 
such parties, and (iii) third, towards payment of principal then due from 
the Borrower hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in 
accordance with the amounts of principal then due to such parties.

(c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim 
or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of, or interest 
on, any of its Term Loans, Revolving Facility Loans or participations in 
L/C Disbursements or Swingline Loans resulting in such Lender receiving 
payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Term Loans, 
Revolving Facility Loans and participations in L/C Disbursements and 
Swingline Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received 
by any other Lender entitled to receive the same proportion of such 
payment, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase 
participations in the Term Loans, Revolving Facility Loans and 
participations in L/C Disbursements and Swingline Loans of such other 
Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments 
shall be shared by all such Lenders ratably in accordance with the 
principal amount of each such Lenders respective Term Loans, Revolving 
Facility Loans and participations in L/C Disbursements and Swingline Loans 
and accrued interest thereon; provided, that (i) if any such participations 
are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is 
recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price 
restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the 
provisions of this clause (c) shall not be construed to apply to any 
payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express 
terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as 
consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of 
its Loans or participations in L/C Disbursements to any assignee or 
participant. The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the 
extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender 
acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may 
exercise against the Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with 
respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct 
creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.

(d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the 
Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the 
Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the applicable 
Issuing Bank hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the 
Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on 
such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, 
distribute to the Lenders or the applicable Issuing Bank, as applicable, 
the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such 
payment, then each of the Lenders or the applicable Issuing Bank, as 
applicable, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith 
on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Bank with 
interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is 
distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the 
Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate 
and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with 
banking industry rules on interbank compensation.

(e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it 
pursuant to Section 2.04(b), 2.05(d) or (e), 2.06, or 2.18(d), then the 
Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary 
provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the 
Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such 
Lenders obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied 
obligations are fully paid.
 
94

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Section 2.19 Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders. (a) If any 
Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if the Borrower is 
required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental 
Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, then such 
Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different Lending Office 
for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and 
obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or Affiliates, 
if, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, such designation or 
assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to 
Section 2.15 or 2.17, as applicable, in the future and (ii) would not 
subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense and would 
not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender in any material respect. 
The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses 
incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or 
assignment.

(b) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if the 
Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any 
Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 
2.17, or if any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, or if any Lender is the 
subject to a Disqualification, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense 
and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, 
require any such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in 
accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04), 
all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an 
assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another 
Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided, that (i) the 
Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the 
Administrative Agent (and, if in respect of any Revolving Facility 
Commitment or Revolving Facility Loan, the Swingline Lender and the Issuing 
Bank), which consent, in each case, shall not unreasonably be withheld, 
(ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the 
outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in L/C Disbursements 
and Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other 
amounts payable to it hereunder from the assignee (to the extent of such 
outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in 
the case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment 
resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.15 or payments 
required to be made pursuant to Section 2.17, such assignment will result 
in a reduction in such compensation or payments. Nothing in this Section 
2.19 shall be deemed to prejudice any rights that the Borrower may have 
against any Lender that is a Defaulting Lender. No action by or consent of 
the removed Lender shall be necessary in connection with such assignment, 
which shall be immediately and automatically effective upon payment of such 
purchase price. In connection with any such assignment the Borrower, 
Administrative Agent, such removed Lender and the replacement Lender shall 
otherwise comply with Section 9.04, provided, that if such removed Lender 
does not comply with Section 9.04 within one Business Day after the 
Borrowers request, compliance with Section 9.04 shall not be required to 
effect such assignment.

(c) If any Lender (such Lender, a Non-Consenting Lender) has failed to 
consent to a proposed amendment, waiver, discharge or termination which 
pursuant to the terms of Section 9.08 requires the consent of all of the 
Lenders affected and with respect to
 
95

------------------------------------------------------------------------
which the Required Lenders shall have granted their consent, then the 
Borrower shall have the right (unless such Non-Consenting Lender grants 
such consent) at its sole expense (including with respect to the processing 
and recordation fee referred to in Section 9.04(b)(ii)(B)) to replace such 
Non-Consenting Lender by requiring such Non-Consenting Lender to (and any 
such Non-Consenting Lender agrees that it shall, upon the Borrowers 
request) assign its Loans and its Commitments (or, at the Borrowers 
option, the Loans and Commitments under the Facility that is the subject of 
the proposed amendment, waiver, discharge or termination) hereunder to one 
or more assignees reasonably acceptable to (i) the Administrative Agent 
(unless such assignee is a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved 
Fund) and (ii) if in respect of any Revolving Facility Commitment or 
Revolving Facility Loan, the Swingline Lender and the Issuing Bank; 
provided, that: (a) all Loan Obligations of the Borrower owing to such 
Non-Consenting Lender being replaced shall be paid in full to such 
Non-Consenting Lender concurrently with such assignment, (b) the 
replacement Lender shall purchase the foregoing by paying to such 
Non-Consenting Lender a price equal to the principal amount thereof plus 
accrued and unpaid interest thereon and the replacement Lender or, at the 
option of the Borrower, the Borrower shall pay any amount required by 
Section 2.12(d)(y), if applicable, and (c) the replacement Lender shall 
grant its consent with respect to the applicable proposed amendment, 
waiver, discharge or termination. No action by or consent of the 
Non-Consenting Lender shall be necessary in connection with such 
assignment, which shall be immediately and automatically effective upon 
payment of such purchase price. In connection with any such assignment the 
Borrower, Administrative Agent, such Non-Consenting Lender and the 
replacement Lender shall otherwise comply with Section 9.04; provided, that 
if such Non-Consenting Lender does not comply with Section 9.04 within one 
Business Day after the Borrowers request, compliance with Section 9.04 
shall not be required to effect such assignment.

Section 2.20 Illegality. If any Lender reasonably determines that any 
Change in Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has 
asserted after the Closing Date that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its 
applicable lending office to make or maintain any Eurocurrency Loans, then, 
on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative 
Agent, any obligations of such Lender to make or continue Eurocurrency 
Loans or to convert ABR Borrowings to Eurocurrency Borrowings shall be 
suspended until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the 
Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer 
exist. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower shall upon demand from 
such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), either convert all 
Eurocurrency Borrowings of such Lender to ABR Borrowings, either on the 
last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully 
continue to maintain such Eurocurrency Borrowings to such day, or 
immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such 
Loans. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay 
accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted.

Section 2.21 Incremental Commitments. (a) The Borrower may, by written 
notice to the Administrative Agent from time to time, request Incremental 
Term Loan Commitments and/or Incremental Revolving Facility Commitments, as 
applicable, in an amount not to exceed the Incremental Amount available at 
the time such Incremental Commitments are established from one or more 
Incremental Term Lenders and/or Incremental Revolving Facility Lenders 
(which may include any existing Lender) willing to provide such Incremental 
Term
 
96

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Loans and/or Incremental Revolving Facility Commitments, as the case may 
be, in their own discretion; provided, that each Incremental Revolving 
Facility Lender providing a commitment to make revolving loans shall be 
subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent and, to the extent the 
same would be required for an assignment under Section 9.04, the Issuing 
Bank and the Swingline Lender (which approvals shall not be unreasonably 
withheld) unless such Incremental Revolving Lender is a Revolving Facility 
Lender, an Affiliate of a Revolving Facility Lender or an Approved Fund of 
a Revolving Facility Lender. Such notice shall set forth (i) the amount of 
the Incremental Term Loan Commitments and/or Incremental Revolving Facility 
Commitments being requested (which shall be in minimum increments of 
$5,000,000 and a minimum amount of $10,000,000, or equal to the remaining 
Incremental Amount or, in each case, such lesser amount approved by the 
Administrative Agent), (ii) the date on which such Incremental Term Loan 
Commitments and/or Incremental Revolving Facility Commitments are requested 
to become effective, (iii) in the case of Incremental Revolving Facility 
Commitments, whether such Incremental Revolving Facility Commitments are to 
be (x) commitments to make additional Revolving Facility Loans on the same 
terms as the Initial Revolving Loans or (y) commitments to make revolving 
loans with pricing terms, final maturity dates, participation in mandatory 
prepayments or commitment reductions and/or other terms different from the 
Initial Revolving Loans (Other Revolving Loans) and (iv) in the case of 
Incremental Term Loan Commitments, whether such Incremental Term Loan 
Commitments are to be (x) commitments to make term loans with terms 
identical to Term B Loans or (y) commitments to make term loans with 
pricing, maturity, amortization, participation in mandatory prepayments 
and/or other terms different from the Term B Loans (Other Term Loans).

(b) The Borrower and each Incremental Term Lender and/or Incremental 
Revolving Facility Lender shall execute and deliver to the Administrative 
Agent an Incremental Assumption Agreement and such other documentation as 
the Administrative Agent shall reasonably specify to evidence the 
Incremental Term Loan Commitment of such Incremental Term Lender and/or 
Incremental Revolving Facility Commitment of such Incremental Revolving 
Facility Lender. Each Incremental Assumption Agreement shall specify the 
terms of the applicable Incremental Term Loans and/or Incremental Revolving 
Facility Commitments; provided, that:

(i) any commitments to make additional Term B Loans and/or additional 
Initial Revolving Loans shall have the same terms as the Term B Loans or 
Initial Revolving Loans, respectively,

(ii) the Other Term Loans incurred pursuant to clause (a) of this Section 
2.21 shall rank pari passu in right of security with the Term B Loans,

(iii) the final maturity date of any such Other Term Loans shall be no 
earlier than the Term B Facility Maturity Date and, except as to pricing, 
amortization, final maturity date, participation in mandatory prepayments 
and ranking as to security reductions (which shall, subject to the other 
clauses of this proviso, be determined by the Borrower and the Incremental 
Term Loan Lenders in their sole discretion), shall have (x) substantially 
the same terms as the Term B Loans or (y) such other terms (including as to 
guarantees and collateral) as shall be reasonably satisfactory to the 
Administrative Agent,
 
97

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(iv) the Weighted Average Life to Maturity of any such Other Term Loans 
shall be no shorter than the remaining Weighted Average Life to Maturity of 
the Term B Loans,

(v) the Other Revolving Loans incurred pursuant to clause (a) of this 
Section 2.21 shall rank pari passu in right of security with the Initial 
Revolving Loans,

(vi) the final maturity date of any such Other Revolving Loans shall be no 
earlier than the Revolving Facility Maturity Date with respect to the 
Initial Revolving Loans and, except as to pricing, final maturity date, 
participation in mandatory prepayments and commitment reductions (which 
shall, subject to the other clauses of this proviso, be determined by the 
Borrower and the Incremental Revolving Facility Lenders in their sole 
discretion), shall have (x) substantially the same terms as the Initial 
Revolving Loans or (y) such other terms (including as to guarantees and 
collateral) as shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative 
Agent,

(vii) with respect to any such Other Term Loan incurred pursuant to clause 
(a) of Section 2.21, the All-in Yield shall be the same as that applicable 
to the Term B Loans on the Closing Date, except that the All-in Yield in 
respect of any such Other Term Loan may exceed the All-in Yield in respect 
of such Term B Loans on the Closing Date by no more than 0.50%, or if it 
does so exceed such All-in Yield (such difference, the Term Yield 
Differential) then the Applicable Margin (or the LIBOR floor as provided 
in the following proviso) applicable to such Term B Loans shall be 
increased such that after giving effect to such increase, the Term Yield 
Differential shall not exceed 0.50%; provided, that, to the extent any 
portion of the Term Yield Differential is attributable to a higher LIBOR 
floor being applicable to such Other Term Loans, such floor shall only be 
included in the calculation of the Term Yield Differential to the extent 
such floor is greater than the Adjusted LIBO Rate in effect for an Interest 
Period of three months duration at such time, and, with respect to such 
excess, the LIBOR floor applicable to the outstanding Term B Loans shall 
be increased to an amount not to exceed the LIBOR floor applicable to 
such Other Term Loans prior to any increase in the Applicable Margin 
applicable to such Term B Loans then outstanding;

(viii) with respect to any commitments to make any such Other Revolving 
Loans incurred pursuant to clause (a) of Section 2.21, the All-in Yield of 
such Other Revolving Loans shall be the same as that applicable to the 
Initial Revolving Loans on the Closing Date, except that the All-in Yield 
in respect of any such Other Revolving Loan may exceed the All-in Yield in 
respect of such Initial Revolving Loans on the Closing Date by no more than 
0.50%, or if it does so exceed such All-in Yield (such difference, the 
Revolving Yield Differential) then the Applicable Margin applicable to 
such Initial Revolving Loans shall be increased such that after giving 
effect to such increase, the Revolving Yield Differential shall not exceed 
0.50%;
 
98

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(ix) (A) the Other Revolving Loans may participate on a pro rata basis or a 
less than pro rata basis (but not a greater than pro rata basis) than the 
Initial Revolving Loans in (x) any voluntary or mandatory prepayment or 
commitment reduction hereunder and (y) any Borrowing at the time such 
Borrowing is made and (B) the Other Term Loans may participate on a pro 
rata basis or a less than pro rata basis (but not a greater than pro rata 
basis) than the Term B Loans in any mandatory prepayment hereunder; and

(x) there shall be no obligor in respect of any Incremental Term Loan 
Commitments or Incremental Revolving Facility Commitments that is not a 
Loan Party.

Each party hereto hereby agrees that, upon the effectiveness of any 
Incremental Assumption Agreement, this Agreement shall be amended to the 
extent (but only to the extent) necessary to reflect the existence and 
terms of the Incremental Term Loan Commitments and/or Incremental Revolving 
Facility Commitments evidenced thereby as provided for in Section 9.08(e). 
Any amendment to this Agreement or any other Loan Document that is 
necessary to effect the provisions of this Section 2.21 and any such 
collateral and other documentation shall be deemed Loan Documents 
hereunder and may be memorialized in writing by the Administrative Agent 
with the Borrowers consent (not to be unreasonably withheld) and furnished 
to the other parties hereto.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Incremental Term Loan Commitment or 
Incremental Revolving Facility Commitment shall become effective under this 
Section 2.21 unless (i) on the date of such effectiveness, to the extent 
required by the relevant Incremental Assumption Agreement, the conditions 
set forth in clauses (b) and (c) of Section 4.01 shall be satisfied and the 
Administrative Agent shall have received a certificate to that effect dated 
such date and executed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower and (ii) 
the Administrative Agent shall have received customary legal opinions, 
board resolutions and other customary closing certificates and 
documentation as required by the relevant Incremental Assumption Agreement 
and, to the extent required by the Administrative Agent, consistent with 
those delivered on the Closing Date under Section 4.02 and such additional 
customary documents and filings (including amendments to the Mortgages and 
other Security Documents and title endorsement bringdowns) as the 
Administrative Agent may reasonably request to assure that the Incremental 
Term Loans and/or Revolving Facility Loans in respect of Incremental 
Revolving Facility Commitments are secured by the Collateral ratably with 
one or more Classes of then-existing Term Loans and Revolving Facility 
Loans.

(d) Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that the Administrative Agent 
may take any and all action as may be reasonably necessary to ensure that 
(i) all Incremental Term Loans (other than Other Term Loans), when 
originally made, are included in each Borrowing of the outstanding 
applicable Class of Term Loans on a pro rata basis, and (ii) all Revolving 
Facility Loans in respect of Incremental Revolving Facility Commitments 
(other than Other Revolving Loans), when originally made, are included in 
each Borrowing of the applicable Class of outstanding Revolving Facility 
Loans on a pro rata basis. The Borrower agrees that Section 2.16 shall 
apply to any conversion of Eurocurrency Loans to ABR Loans reasonably 
required by the Administrative Agent to effect the foregoing.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, including 
Section 2.18(c) (which provisions shall not be applicable to clauses (e) 
through (i) of this Section 2.21), pursuant to one or more offers made from 
time to time by the Borrower to all Lenders of any Class of Term Loans 
and/or Revolving Facility Commitments, on a pro rata basis (based, in the 
case of an offer to the Lenders under any Class of Term Loans, on the 
aggregate outstanding Term Loans of such Class and, in the case of an offer 
to the Lenders under any Revolving Facility, on the aggregate outstanding 
Revolving Facility Commitments under such Revolving Facility, as 
applicable) and on the same terms (Pro Rata Extension Offers), the 
Borrower is hereby permitted to consummate transactions with individual 
Lenders from time to time to extend the maturity date of such Lenders 
Loans and/or Commitments of such Class and to otherwise modify the terms of 
such Lenders Loans and/or Commitments of such Class pursuant to the terms 
of the relevant Pro Rata Extension Offer (including, without limitation, 
increasing the interest rate or fees payable in respect of such Lenders 
Loans and/or Commitments and/or modifying the amortization schedule in 
respect of such Lenders Loans). For the avoidance of doubt, the reference 
to on the same terms in the preceding sentence shall mean, (i) in the 
case of an offer to the Lenders under any Class of Term Loans, that all of 
the Term Loans of such Class are offered to be extended for the same amount 
of time and that the interest rate changes and fees payable with respect to 
such extension are the same and (ii) in the case of an offer to the Lenders 
under any Revolving Facility, that all of the Revolving Facility 
Commitments of such Facility are offered to be extended for the same amount 
of time and that the interest rate changes and fees payable with respect to 
such extension are the same. Any such extension (an Extension) agreed to 
between the Borrower and any such Lender (an Extending Lender) will be 
established under this Agreement by implementing an Incremental Term Loan 
for such Lender if such Lender is extending an existing Term Loan (such 
extended Term Loan, an Extended Term Loan) or an Incremental Revolving 
Facility Commitment for such Lender if such Lender is extending an existing 
Revolving Facility Commitment (such extended Revolving Facility Commitment, 
an Extended Revolving Facility Commitment). Each Pro Rata Extension Offer 
shall specify the date on which the Borrower proposes that the Extended 
Term Loan shall be made, which shall be a date not earlier than five 
Business Days after the date on which notice is delivered to the 
Administrative Agent (or such shorter period agreed to by the 
Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion).

(f) The Borrower and each Extending Lender shall execute and deliver to the 
Administrative Agent an Incremental Assumption Agreement and such other 
documentation as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably specify to 
evidence the Extended Term Loans and/or Extended Revolving Facility 
Commitments of such Extending Lender. Each Incremental Assumption Agreement 
shall specify the terms of the applicable Extended Term Loans and/or 
Extended Revolving Facility Commitments; provided, that (i) except as to 
interest rates, fees, any other pricing terms, amortization, final maturity 
date and participation in prepayments and commitment reductions (which 
shall, subject to clauses (ii) and (iii) of this proviso, be determined by 
the Borrower and set forth in the Pro Rata Extension Offer), the Extended 
Term Loans shall have (x) the same terms as an existing Class of Term Loans 
or (y) such other terms as shall be reasonably satisfactory to the 
Administrative Agent, (ii) the final maturity date of any Extended Term 
Loans shall be no earlier than the latest Term Facility Maturity Date in 
effect on the date of incurrence, (iii) the Weighted Average Life to 
Maturity of any Extended Term Loans shall be no shorter than the remaining 
Weighted Average Life to
 
100

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Maturity of the Class of Term Loans to which such offer relates, (iv) 
except as to interest rates, fees, any other pricing terms, participation 
in mandatory prepayments and commitment reductions and final maturity 
(which shall be determined by the Borrower and set forth in the Pro Rata 
Extension Offer), any Extended Revolving Facility Commitment shall have (x) 
the same terms as an existing Class of Revolving Facility Commitments or 
(y) have such other terms as shall be reasonably satisfactory to the 
Administrative Agent, and (v) any Extended Term Loans and/or Extended 
Revolving Facility Commitments may participate on a pro rata basis or a 
less than pro rata basis (but not greater than a pro rata basis) in any 
voluntary or mandatory repayments or prepayments hereunder. Upon the 
effectiveness of any Incremental Assumption Agreement, this Agreement shall 
be amended to the extent (but only to the extent) necessary to reflect the 
existence and terms of the Extended Term Loans and/or Extended Revolving 
Facility Commitments evidenced thereby as provided for in Section 9.08(e). 
Any such deemed amendment may be memorialized in writing by the 
Administrative Agent with the Borrowers consent (not to be unreasonably 
withheld) and furnished to the other parties hereto. If provided in any 
Incremental Assumption Agreement with respect to any Extended Revolving 
Facility Commitments, and with the consent of each Swingline Lender and 
Issuing Bank, participations in Swingline Loans and Letters of Credit shall 
be reallocated to lenders holding such Extended Revolving Facility 
Commitments in the manner specified in such Incremental Assumption 
Agreement, including upon effectiveness of such Extended Revolving Facility 
Commitment or upon or prior to the maturity date for any Class of Revolving 
Facility Commitments.

(g) Upon the effectiveness of any such Extension, the applicable Extending 
Lenders Term Loan will be automatically designated an Extended Term Loan 
and/or such Extending Lenders Revolving Facility Commitment will be 
automatically designated an Extended Revolving Facility Commitment. For 
purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, (i) if such 
Extending Lender is extending a Term Loan, such Extending Lender will be 
deemed to have an Incremental Term Loan having the terms of such Extended 
Term Loan and (ii) if such Extending Lender is extending a Revolving 
Facility Commitment, such Extending Lender will be deemed to have an 
Incremental Revolving Facility Commitment having the terms of such Extended 
Revolving Facility Commitment.

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement or 
any other Loan Document (including without limitation this Section 2.21), 
(i) the aggregate amount of Extended Term Loans and Extended Revolving 
Facility Commitments will not be included in the calculation of the 
Incremental Amount, (ii) no Extended Term Loan or Extended Revolving 
Facility Commitment is required to be in any minimum amount or any minimum 
increment, (iii) any Extending Lender may extend all or any portion of its 
Term Loans and/or Revolving Facility Commitment pursuant to one or more Pro 
Rata Extension Offers (subject to applicable proration in the case of over 
participation) (including the extension of any Extended Term Loan and/or 
Extended Revolving Facility Commitment), (iv) there shall be no condition 
to any Extension of any Loan or Commitment at any time or from time to time 
other than notice to the Administrative Agent of such Extension and the 
terms of the Extended Term Loan or Extended Revolving Facility Commitment 
implemented thereby, (v) all Extended Term Loans, Extended Revolving 
Facility Commitments and all obligations in respect thereof shall be Loan 
Obligations of the relevant Loan Parties under this Agreement and the other 
Loan Documents that are secured by the Collateral on a pari passu basis 
with all other Obligations of
 
101

------------------------------------------------------------------------
the relevant Loan Parties under this Agreement and the other Loan 
Documents, (vi) no Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender shall be obligated to 
provide Swingline Loans or issue Letters of Credit under such Extended 
Revolving Facility Commitments unless it shall have consented thereto and 
(vii) there shall be no obligor in respect of any such Extended Term Loans 
or Extended Revolving Facility Commitments that is not a Loan Party.

(i) Each Extension shall be consummated pursuant to procedures set forth in 
the associated Pro Rata Extension Offer; provided, that the Borrower shall 
cooperate with the Administrative Agent prior to making any Pro Rata 
Extension Offer to establish reasonable procedures with respect to 
mechanical provisions relating to such Extension, including, without 
limitation, timing, rounding and other adjustments.

(j) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, including 
Section 2.18(c) (which provisions shall not be applicable to clauses (j) 
through (o) of this Section 2.21), the Borrower may by written notice to 
the Administrative Agent establish one or more additional tranches of term 
loans under this Agreement (such loans, Refinancing Term Loans), the net 
cash proceeds of which are used to Refinance in whole or in part any Class 
of Term Loans. Each such notice shall specify the date (each, a 
Refinancing Effective Date) on which the Borrower proposes that the 
Refinancing Term Loans shall be made, which shall be a date not earlier 
than five Business Days after the date on which such notice is delivered to 
the Administrative Agent (or such shorter period agreed to by the 
Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion); provided, that:

(i) before and after giving effect to the borrowing of such Refinancing 
Term Loans on the Refinancing Effective Date each of the conditions set 
forth in Section 4.01 shall be satisfied to the extent required by the 
relevant Incremental Assumption Agreement governing such Refinancing Term 
Loans;

(ii) the final maturity date of the Refinancing Term Loans shall be no 
earlier than the Term Facility Maturity Date of the refinanced Term Loans,

(iii) the Weighted Average Life to Maturity of such Refinancing Term Loans 
shall be no shorter than the then-remaining Weighted Average Life to 
Maturity of the refinanced Term Loans;

(iv) the aggregate principal amount of the Refinancing Term Loans shall not 
exceed the outstanding principal amount of the refinanced Term Loans plus 
amounts used to pay fees, premiums, costs and expenses (including original 
issue discount) and accrued interest associated therewith;

(v) all other terms applicable to such Refinancing Term Loans (other than 
provisions relating to original issue discount, upfront fees, interest 
rates or any other pricing terms and optional prepayment or mandatory 
prepayment or redemption terms and final maturity, which shall be as agreed 
between the Borrower and the Lenders providing such Refinancing Term Loans) 
taken as a whole shall be substantially similar to, or not materially less 
favorable to the Borrower and its Subsidiaries than, the terms, taken as a 
whole, applicable to the Term B Loans (except to the extent such covenants
 
102

------------------------------------------------------------------------
and other terms apply solely to any period after the Term B Facility 
Maturity Date or are otherwise reasonably acceptable to the Administrative 
Agent), as determined by the Borrower in good faith. In addition, 
notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrower may establish Refinancing Term 
Loans to refinance and/or replace all or any portion of a Revolving 
Facility Commitment (regardless of whether Revolving Facility Loans are 
outstanding under such Revolving Facility Commitments at the time of 
incurrence of such Refinancing Term Loans), so long as (i) the aggregate 
amount of such Refinancing Term Loans does not exceed the aggregate amount 
of Revolving Facility Commitments terminated at the time of incurrence 
thereof and (ii) if the Revolving Facility Credit Exposure outstanding on 
the Refinancing Effective Date would exceed the aggregate amount of 
Revolving Facility Commitments outstanding, in each case after giving 
effect to the termination of such Revolving Facility Commitments, the 
Borrower shall take one or more actions such that such Revolving Facility 
Credit Exposure does not exceed such aggregate amount of Revolving Facility 
Commitments in effect on the Refinancing Effective Date after giving effect 
to the termination of such Revolving Facility Commitments (it being 
understood that such Refinancing Term Loans may be provided by the Lenders 
holding the Revolving Facility Commitments being terminated and/or by any 
other person that would be a permitted Assignee hereunder);

(vi) with respect to Refinancing Term Loans secured by Liens on the 
Collateral that rank junior in right of security to an existing Class of 
Term Loans, such Liens will be subject to a Permitted Junior Intercreditor 
Agreement;

(vii) there shall be no obligor in respect of such Refinancing Term Loans 
that is not a Loan Party; and

(viii) the Refinancing Term Loans may participate on a pro rata basis or a 
less than pro rata basis (but not a greater than pro rata basis) than the 
Term B Loans in any prepayment hereunder.

(k) The Borrower may approach any Lender or any other person that would be 
a permitted Assignee pursuant to Section 9.04 to provide all or a portion 
of the Refinancing Term Loans; provided, that any Lender offered or 
approached to provide all or a portion of the Refinancing Term Loans may 
elect or decline, in its sole discretion, to provide a Refinancing Term 
Loan. Any Refinancing Term Loans made on any Refinancing Effective Date 
shall be designated an additional Class of Term Loans for all purposes of 
this Agreement; provided, further, that any Refinancing Term Loans may, to 
the extent provided in the applicable Incremental Assumption Agreement 
governing such Refinancing Term Loans, be designated as an increase in any 
previously established Class of Term Loans made to the Borrower.

(l) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, including 
Section 2.18(c) (which provisions shall not be applicable to clause (l) 
through (o) of this Section 2.21), the Borrower may by written notice to 
the Administrative Agent establish one or more additional Facilities 
providing for revolving commitments (Replacement Revolving Facility 
Commitments and the revolving loans thereunder, Replacement Revolving 
Loans), which replace in whole or in part any Class of Revolving Facility 
Commitments under this Agreement. Each such notice shall specify the date 
(each, a Replacement Revolving Facility
 
103

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Effective Date) on which the Borrower proposes that the Replacement 
Revolving Facility Commitments shall become effective, which shall be a 
date not less than five Business Days after the date on which such notice 
is delivered to the Administrative Agent (or such shorter period agreed to 
by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion); provided, that: 
(i) before and after giving effect to the establishment of such Replacement 
Revolving Facility Commitments on the Replacement Revolving Facility 
Effective Date, each of the conditions set forth in Section 4.01 shall be 
satisfied to the extent required by the relevant Incremental Assumption 
Agreement governing such Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments; (ii) 
after giving effect to the establishment of any Replacement Revolving 
Facility Commitments and any concurrent reduction in the aggregate amount 
of any other Revolving Facility Commitments, the aggregate amount of 
Revolving Facility Commitments shall not exceed the aggregate amount of the 
Revolving Facility Commitments outstanding immediately prior to the 
applicable Replacement Revolving Facility Effective Date; (iii) no 
Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments shall have a final maturity date 
(or require commitment reductions or amortizations) prior to the Revolving 
Facility Maturity Date in effect at the time of incurrence for the 
Revolving Facility Commitments being replaced; (iv) all other terms 
applicable to such Replacement Revolving Facility (other than provisions 
relating to (x) fees, interest rates and other pricing terms and prepayment 
and commitment reduction and optional redemption terms which shall be as 
agreed between the Borrower and the Lenders providing such Replacement 
Revolving Facility Commitments and (y) the amount of any letter of credit 
sublimit and swingline commitment under such Replacement Revolving 
Facility, which shall be as agreed between the Borrower, the Lenders 
providing such Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments, the 
Administrative Agent and the replacement issuing bank and replacement 
swingline lender, if any, under such Replacement Revolving Facility 
Commitments) taken as a whole shall be substantially similar to, or not 
materially more favorable to the Lenders providing such Replacement 
Revolving Facility Commitments than, those, taken as a whole, applicable to 
the Initial Revolving Loans (except to the extent such covenants and other 
terms apply solely to any period after the latest Revolving Facility 
Maturity Date in effect at the time of incurrence or are otherwise 
reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent); (v) there shall be no 
obligor in respect of such Replacement Revolving Facility that is not a 
Loan Party and (vi) the Replacement Revolving Commitments may participate 
on a pro rata basis or a less than pro rata basis (but not a greater than 
pro rata basis) than the Initial Revolving Loans in (x) any voluntary or 
mandatory prepayment or commitment reduction hereunder and (y) any 
Borrowing at the time such Borrowing is made. In addition, the Borrower may 
establish Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments to refinance and/or 
replace all or any portion of a Term Loan hereunder (regardless of whether 
such Term Loan is repaid with the proceeds of Replacement Revolving Loans 
or otherwise), so long as the aggregate amount of such Replacement 
Revolving Facility Commitments does not exceed the aggregate amount of Term 
Loans repaid at the time of establishment thereof (it being understood that 
such Replacement Revolving Facility Commitment may be provided by the 
Lenders holding the Term Loans being repaid and/or by any other Person that 
would be a permitted Assignee hereunder) so long as (i) before and after 
giving effect to the establishment such Replacement Revolving Facility 
Commitments on the Replacement Revolving Facility Effective Date each of 
the conditions set forth in Section 4.01 shall be satisfied to the extent 
required by the relevant agreement governing such Replacement Revolving 
Facility Commitments, (ii) the weighted average life to termination of such 
Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments shall be not shorter than the 
Weighted Average
 
104

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Life to Maturity then applicable to the refinanced Term Loans, (iii) the 
final termination date of the Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments 
shall be no earlier than the Term Facility Maturity Date of the refinanced 
Term Loans, (iv) with respect to Replacement Revolving Loans secured by 
Liens on Collateral that rank junior in right of security to the Revolving 
Facility Loans, such Liens will be subject to a Permitted Junior 
Intercreditor Agreement and (v) the requirement of clause (v) in the 
preceding sentence shall be satisfied mutatis mutandis.

(m) The Borrower may approach any Lender or any other person that would be 
a permitted Assignee of a Revolving Facility Commitment pursuant to Section 
9.04 to provide all or a portion of the Replacement Revolving Facility 
Commitments; provided, that any Lender offered or approached to provide all 
or a portion of the Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments may elect or 
decline, in its sole discretion, to provide a Replacement Revolving 
Facility Commitment. Any Replacement Revolving Facility Commitment made on 
any Replacement Revolving Facility Effective Date shall be designated an 
additional Class of Revolving Facility Commitments for all purposes of this 
Agreement; provided, that any Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments 
may, to the extent provided in the applicable Incremental Assumption 
Agreement, be designated as an increase in any previously established Class 
of Revolving Facility Commitments.

(n) On any Replacement Revolving Facility Effective Date, subject to the 
satisfaction of the foregoing terms and conditions, each of the Lenders 
with Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments of such Class shall 
purchase from each of the other Lenders with Replacement Revolving Facility 
Commitments of such Class, at the principal amount thereof and in the 
applicable currencies, such interests in the Replacement Revolving Loans 
and participations in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans under such 
Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments of such Class then outstanding 
on such Replacement Revolving Facility Effective Date as shall be necessary 
in order that, after giving effect to all such assignments and purchases, 
the Replacement Revolving Loans and participations of such Replacement 
Revolving Facility Commitments of such Class will be held by the Lenders 
thereunder ratably in accordance with their Replacement Revolving Facility 
Commitments.

(o) For purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, (i) if a 
Lender is providing a Refinancing Term Loan, such Lender will be deemed to 
have an Incremental Term Loan having the terms of such Refinancing Term 
Loan and (ii) if a Lender is providing a Replacement Revolving Facility 
Commitment, such Lender will be deemed to have an Incremental Revolving 
Facility Commitment having the terms of such Replacement Revolving Facility 
Commitment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this 
Agreement or any other Loan Document (including without limitation this 
Section 2.21), (i) the aggregate amount of Refinancing Term Loans and 
Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments will not be included in the 
calculation of the Incremental Amount, (ii) no Refinancing Term Loan or 
Replacement Revolving Facility Commitment is required to be in any minimum 
amount or any minimum increment, (iii) there shall be no condition to any 
incurrence of any Refinancing Term Loan or Replacement Revolving Facility 
Commitment at any time or from time to time other than those set forth in 
clauses (j) or (l) above, as applicable, and (iv) all Refinancing Term 
Loans, Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments and all obligations in 
respect thereof shall be Obligations under this Agreement and the other 
Loan Documents that are secured by the Collateral on a pari passu basis 
with all other Obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan 
Documents.
 
105

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(p) Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, (i) for the 
purpose of determining the number of outstanding Eurocurrency Borrowings 
upon the incurrence of any Incremental Loans, (x) to the extent the last 
date of Interest Periods for multiple Eurocurrency Borrowings under the 
Term Facilities fall on the same day, such Eurocurrency Borrowings shall be 
considered a single Eurocurrency Borrowing and (y) to the extent the last 
date of Interest Periods for multiple Eurocurrency Borrowings under the 
Revolving Facilities fall on the same day, such Eurocurrency Borrowings 
shall be considered a single Eurocurrency Borrowing and (ii) the initial 
Interest Period with respect to any Eurocurrency Borrowing of Incremental 
Loans may, at the Borrowers option, be of a duration of a number of 
Business Days that is less than one month, and the Adjusted LIBO Rate with 
respect to such initial Interest Period shall be the same as the Adjusted 
LIBO Rate applicable to any then-outstanding Eurocurrency Borrowing as the 
Borrower may direct, so long as the last day of such initial Interest 
Period is the same as the last day of the Interest Period with respect to 
such outstanding Eurocurrency Borrowing.

Section 2.22 Defaulting Lender. (a) Defaulting Lender Adjustments. 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if 
any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as such 
Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by 
applicable law:

(i) Waivers and Amendments. Such Defaulting Lenders right to approve or 
disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement 
shall be restricted as set forth in the definitions of Required Lenders 
or Required Revolving Facility Lenders.

(ii) Defaulting Lender Waterfall. Any payment of principal, interest, fees 
or other amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the account of 
such Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, 
following an Event of Default or otherwise) or received by the 
Administrative Agent from a Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 9.06 
shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the 
Administrative Agent as follows: first, to the payment of any amounts owing 
by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder, second, to 
the payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts owing by such Defaulting 
Lender to any Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender hereunder, third, to 
Cash Collateralize the Issuing Banks Fronting Exposure with respect to 
such Defaulting Lender in accordance with Section 2.05(j), fourth, as the 
Borrower may request (so long as no Default or Event of Default exists), to 
the funding of any Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has 
failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as 
determined by the Administrative Agent, fifth, if so determined by the 
Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to be held in a deposit account and 
released pro rata in order to (x) satisfy such Defaulting Lenders 
potential future funding obligations with respect to Loans under this 
Agreement and (y) Cash Collateralize the Issuing Banks future Fronting 
Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender with respect to future 
Letters of Credit issued under this Agreement, in accordance with Section 
2.05(j), sixth, to the payment of any amounts
 
106

------------------------------------------------------------------------
owing to the Lenders, the Issuing Banks or the Swingline Lender as a result 
of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any 
Lender, Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender against such Defaulting Lender as 
a result of such Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under this 
Agreement, seventh, so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to 
the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower as a result of any 
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower 
against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lenders 
breach of its obligations under this Agreement, and eighth, to such 
Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent 
jurisdiction. Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to 
a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a 
Defaulting Lender or to post Cash Collateral pursuant to this Section 2.22 
shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each 
Lender irrevocably consents hereto.

(iii) Certain Fees. (A) No Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive 
any Commitment Fee for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting 
Lender.

(B) Each Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive L/C Participation 
Fees for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender only to 
the extent allocable to its pro rata share of the stated amount of Letters 
of Credit for which it has provided Cash Collateral.

(C) With respect to any Commitment Fee or L/C Participation Fee not 
required to be paid to any Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (A) or (B) 
above, the Borrower shall (x) pay to each Non-Defaulting Lender that 
portion of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender with 
respect to such Defaulting Lenders participation in Letters of Credit or 
Swingline Loans that has been reallocated to such Non-Defaulting Lender 
pursuant to clause (iv) below, (y) pay to each Issuing Bank and the 
Swingline Lender, as applicable, the amount of any such fee otherwise 
payable to such Defaulting Lender to the extent allocable to such Issuing 
Banks or the Swingline Lenders Fronting Exposure to such Defaulting 
Lender, and (z) not be required to pay the remaining amount of any such 
fee.

(iv) Reallocation of Participations to Reduce Fronting Exposure. All or any 
part of such Defaulting Lenders participation in Letters of Credit and 
Swingline Loans shall be reallocated among the Non-Defaulting Lenders in 
accordance with their respective pro rata Commitments (calculated without 
regard to such Defaulting Lenders Commitment) but only to the extent that 
(x) the conditions set forth in Section 4.01 are satisfied at the time of 
such reallocation and (y) such reallocation does not cause the aggregate 
Revolving Facility Credit Exposure of any Non-Defaulting Lender to exceed 
such Non-Defaulting Lenders Revolving Facility Commitment. No reallocation 
hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party 
hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having 
become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a Non-Defaulting Lender 
as a result of such Non-Defaulting Lenders increased exposure following 
such reallocation.
 
107

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(v) Cash Collateral, Repayment of Swingline Loans. If the reallocation 
described in clause (iv) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, 
the Borrower shall, without prejudice to any right or remedy available to 
it hereunder or under law, within three (3) Business Days following the 
written request of the (i) Administrative Agent or (ii) the Swingline 
Lender or any Issuing Bank, as applicable (with a copy to the 
Administrative Agent), (x) first, prepay Swingline Loans in an amount equal 
to the Swingline Lenders Fronting Exposure and (y) second, Cash 
Collateralize the Issuing Banks Fronting Exposure in accordance with the 
procedures set forth in Section 2.05(j).

(b) Defaulting Lender Cure. If the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and 
the Swingline Lender and each Issuing Bank agree in writing that a Lender 
is no longer a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify 
the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such 
notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include 
arrangements with respect to any Cash Collateral), that Lender will, to the 
extent applicable, purchase at par that portion of outstanding Revolving 
Facility Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the 
Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Loans and 
funded and unfunded participations in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans 
to be held pro rata by the Lenders in accordance with their Revolving

retentions) in such amounts and against such risks as are customarily 
maintained by similarly situated companies engaged in the same or similar 
businesses operating in the same or similar locations, cause the Borrower 
and Subsidiary Guarantors to be listed as insured and the Collateral Agent 
to be listed as a co-loss payee on property and casualty policies and as an 
additional insured on liability policies. Notwithstanding the foregoing, 
the Borrower and the Subsidiaries may self-insure with respect to such 
risks with respect to which companies of established reputation engaged in

deliver to the Collateral Agent evidence of such compliance in form and 
substance reasonably acceptable to the Collateral Agent.

(d) In connection with the covenants set forth in this Section 5.02, it is 
understood and agreed that:

other than the aforesaid parties for the recovery of such loss or damage 
and (B) such insurance companies shall have no rights of subrogation

Issuing Bank or their agents or employees. If, however, the insurance 
policies, as a
 
123

------------------------------------------------------------------------
matter of the internal policy of such insurer, do not provide waiver of 
subrogation rights against such parties, as required above, then each of 
Holdings and the Borrower, on behalf of itself and behalf of each of its 
Subsidiaries, hereby agrees, to the extent permitted by law, to waive, and 
further agrees to cause each of their Subsidiaries to waive, its right of 
recovery, if any, against the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, 
the Lenders, any Issuing Bank and their agents and employees; and

(ii) the designation of any form, type or amount of insurance coverage by 
the Collateral Agent (including acting in the capacity as the Collateral 
Agent) under this Section 5.02 shall in no event be deemed a 
representation, warranty or advice by the Collateral Agent or the Lenders 
that such insurance is adequate for the purposes of the business of 
Holdings, the Borrower and the Subsidiaries or the protection of their 
properties.

Section 5.03 Taxes. Pay its obligations in respect of all Tax liabilities, 
assessments and governmental charges, before the same shall become

reserves therefor in accordance with GAAP or (ii) the failure to make 
payment could not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, 
to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

Indebtedness was incurred (in respect of term Indebtedness) or committed

is incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other 
than Dollars (or in a different currency from the Indebtedness being 
refinanced), and such refinancing would cause the applicable 
Dollar-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant 
currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such 
Dollar-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so 
long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not 
exceed (i) the outstanding or committed principal amount, as applicable, of 
such Indebtedness being refinanced plus (ii) the aggregate amount of fees, 
underwriting discounts, premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance 
costs and other costs and expenses incurred in connection with such 
refinancing.

Further, for purposes of determining compliance with this Section 6.01, (A) 
Indebtedness need not be permitted solely by reference to one category of 
permitted Indebtedness described in Sections 6.01(a) through (gg) but may 
be permitted in part under any combination thereof and (B) in the event 
that an item of Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) meets the criteria of 
one or more of the categories of permitted Indebtedness described in 
Sections 6.01(a) through (gg), the Borrower shall, in its sole discretion, 
classify or reclassify, or later divide, classify or reclassify, such item 
of Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) in any manner that complies with 
this Section 6.01 and will only be required to include the amount and type 
of such item of Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) in one of the above 
clauses and such item of Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) shall be 
treated as having been incurred or existing pursuant to only one of such 
clauses; provided, that all Indebtedness outstanding on the Closing Date 
under this Agreement shall at all times be deemed to have been incurred 
pursuant to clause (b) of this Section 6.01. In addition, with respect to 
any Indebtedness that was permitted to be incurred hereunder on the date of 
such incurrence, any Increased Amount of such Indebtedness shall also be 
permitted hereunder after the date of such incurrence.

With respect to any term Indebtedness for borrowed money incurred under 
Section 6.01(h)(i) (to the extent set forth therein), 6.01(r)(i), 
6.01(s)(i) or 6.01(z)(i), (A) the stated maturity date of such Indebtedness 
shall be no earlier than the Term B Facility Maturity Date as in effect at 
the time such Indebtedness is incurred and (B) the Weighted Average Life to 
Maturity of such Indebtedness shall be no shorter than the remaining 
Weighted Average Life to Maturity of the Term B Loans in effect at the time 
such Indebtedness is incurred.

perfection or priority results from the limitations of foreign laws, rules

Subsidiaries or the application thereof, or from the failure of the 
Collateral Agent to maintain possession of certificates actually delivered 
to it representing securities pledged under the Collateral Agreement and

requirements of the Financial Covenant, from the last day of the applicable 
Fiscal Quarter until the expiration of the 10th Business Day subsequent to 
the date the certificate calculating such Financial Covenant is required to 
be delivered pursuant to Section 5.04(c), Holdings, the Borrower and any 
Parent Entity shall have the right to issue Permitted Cure Securities for 
cash or otherwise receive cash contributions to the capital of such 
entities, and in each case, to contribute any such cash to the capital of 
the Borrower (collectively, the Cure Right), and upon the receipt by the 
Borrower of such cash (the Cure Amount), pursuant to the exercise of the 
Cure Right, the Financial Covenant shall be recalculated giving effect to a 
pro forma adjustment by which EBITDA shall be increased with respect to 
such applicable quarter and any four-quarter period that contains such 
quarter, solely for the purpose of measuring the Financial Covenant and not 
for any other purpose under this Agreement, by an amount equal to the Cure 
Amount; provided, that (i) in each four consecutive fiscal quarter period 
there shall be at least two fiscal quarters in which a Cure Right is not 
exercised, (ii) a Cure Right shall not be exercised more than five times 
during the term of the Revolving Facility, (iii) for purposes of this 
Section 7.03, the Cure Amount shall be no greater than the amount required

of the Cure Right for determining compliance with the Financial Covenant 
for the fiscal quarter in respect of which such Cure Right is exercised 
(either directly through prepayment or indirectly as a result of the 
netting of unrestricted cash). If, after giving effect to the adjustments 
in this paragraph, the Borrower shall then be in compliance with the 
requirements of the Financial Covenant, the Borrower shall be deemed to 
have satisfied the requirements of the Financial Covenant as of the 
relevant date of determination with the same effect as though there had 
been no failure to comply therewith at such date, and the applicable breach 
or default of the Financial Covenant that had occurred shall be deemed 
cured for the purposes of this Agreement.

Agreements and Secured Hedging Agreements) and each Issuing Bank (in such 
capacities and on behalf of itself and its Affiliates as potential 
counterparties to Secured Cash Management Agreements and Secured Hedging 
Agreements) hereby irrevocably designates and appoints the Administrative 
Agent as the agent of such Lender under this Agreement and the other Loan 
Documents, including as the Collateral Agent for such Lender and the other 
Secured Parties under the Security Documents, and each such Lender 
irrevocably authorizes the Administrative Agent, in such capacity, to take 
such action on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and the 
other Loan Documents and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as 
are expressly delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms of this 
Agreement and the other Loan Documents, together with such other powers as 
are reasonably incidental thereto. In addition, to the extent required 
under the laws of any jurisdiction other than the United States of America, 
each of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks hereby grants to the 
Administrative Agent any required powers of attorney to execute any 
Security Document governed by the laws of such jurisdiction on such 
Lenders or Issuing Banks behalf. Notwithstanding any provision to the 
contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall not 
have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth 
herein, or any fiduciary relationship with any Lender, and no implied 
covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities 
shall be read into this Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise 
exist against the Administrative Agent.

(b) In furtherance of the foregoing, each Lender (in its capacities as a 
Lender and the Swingline Lender (if applicable) and on behalf of itself and 
its Affiliates as potential counterparties to Secured Cash Management 
Agreements or Secured Hedge Agreements) and each Issuing Bank (in such 
capacities and on behalf of itself and its Affiliates as potential 
counterparties to Secured Cash Management Agreements and Secured Hedging 
Agreements) hereby appoints and authorizes the Collateral Agent to act as 
the agent of such Lender for purposes of acquiring, holding and enforcing 
any and all Liens on Collateral granted by any of the Loan Parties to 
secure any of the Obligations, together with such powers and discretion as 
are reasonably incidental thereto. In this connection, the Collateral Agent 
(and any Subagents appointed by the Collateral Agent pursuant to Section 
8.02 for purposes of holding or enforcing any Lien on the Collateral (or 
any portion thereof) granted under the Security Documents, or for 
exercising any rights or remedies thereunder at the direction of the 
Collateral Agent) shall be entitled to the benefits of this Article VIII 
(including, without limitation, Section 8.07) as though the Collateral 
Agent (and any such Subagents) were an Agent under the Loan Documents, as 
if set forth in full herein with respect thereto.

Section 8.02 Delegation of Duties. The Administrative Agent and the 
Collateral Agent may execute any of their respective duties under this 
Agreement and the other Loan Documents (including for purposes of holding 
or enforcing any Lien on the Collateral (or any portion thereof) by or 
through agents, employees or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to
 
165

------------------------------------------------------------------------
advice of counsel and other consultants or experts concerning all matters 
pertaining to such duties. No Agent shall be responsible for the negligence 
or misconduct of any agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by it with 
reasonable care. Each Agent may also from time to time, when it deems it to 
be necessary or desirable, appoint one or more trustees, co-trustees, 
collateral co-agents, collateral subagents or attorneys-in-fact (each, a 
Subagent) with respect to all or any part of the Collateral; provided, 
that no such Subagent shall be authorized to take any action with respect 
to any Collateral unless and except to the extent expressly authorized in 
writing by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent. Should any 
instrument in writing from the Borrower or any other Loan Party be required 
by any Subagent so appointed by an Agent to more fully or certainly vest in 
and confirm to such Subagent such rights, powers, privileges and duties, 
the Borrower shall, or shall cause such Loan Party to, execute, acknowledge 
and deliver any and all such instruments promptly upon request by such 
Agent. If any Subagent, or successor thereto, shall become incapable of 
acting, resign or be removed, all rights, powers, privileges and duties of 
such Subagent, to the extent permitted by law, shall automatically vest in 
and be exercised by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent until 
the appointment of a new Subagent. No Agent shall be responsible for the 
negligence or misconduct of any agent, attorney-in-fact or Subagent that it 
selects with reasonable care.

Section 8.03 Exculpatory Provisions. None of the Agents, or their 
respective Affiliates or any of their respective officers, directors, 
employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates shall be (a) liable for 
any action lawfully taken or omitted to be taken by it or such person under 
or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document (except to 
the extent that any of the foregoing are found by a final and nonappealable 
decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from its or 
such persons own gross negligence or willful misconduct) or (b) 
responsible in any manner to any of the Lenders for any recitals, 
statements, representations or warranties made by any Loan Party or any 
officer thereof contained in this Agreement or any other Loan Document or 
in any certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or 
provided for in, or received by any Agent under or in connection with, this 
Agreement or any other Loan Document or for the value, validity, 
effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement 
or any other Loan Document or for any failure of any Loan Party a party 
thereto to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder. No Agent shall 
be under any obligation to any Lender to ascertain or to inquire as to the 
observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or 
conditions of, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or to inspect the 
properties, books or records of any Loan Party. No Agent shall have any 
duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the 
other Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) 
no Agent shall be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, 
regardless of whether a Default or Event of Default has occurred and is 
continuing, and (b) no Agent shall, except as expressly set forth herein 
and in the other Loan Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall be 
liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the 
Borrower or any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by 
such Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. The Agents shall be 
deemed not to have knowledge of any Default or Event of Default unless and 
until written notice describing such Default or Event of Default is given 
to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower, a Lender or Issuing Bank. No 
Agent shall be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire 
into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection 
with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any 
certificate, report or
 
166

------------------------------------------------------------------------
other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith 
or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, 
agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the 
occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, (iv) the validity, 
enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other 
Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, or the 
creation, perfection or priority of any Lien purported to be created by the 
Security Documents, (v) the value or the sufficiency of any Collateral, or 
(vi) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere 
herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be 
delivered to the Administrative Agent.

Section 8.04 Reliance by Agents. Each Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, 
and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, 
certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing 
(including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or 
other distribution) or conversation believed by it to be genuine and to 
have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper person. 
Each Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by 
telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper person, and 
shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining 
compliance with any condition hereunder to any Credit Event, that by its 
terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender or any Issuing 
Bank, each Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such 
Lender or Issuing Bank unless such Agent shall have received notice to the 
contrary from such Lender or Issuing Bank prior to such Credit Event. Each 
Agent may consult with legal counsel (including counsel to Holdings or the 
Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and 
shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance 
with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts. Each Agent may 
deem and treat the Lender specified in the Register with respect to any 
amount owing hereunder as the owner thereof for all purposes unless a 
written notice of assignment, negotiation or transfer thereof shall have 
been filed with such Agent. Each Agent shall be fully justified in failing 
or refusing to take any action under this Agreement or any other Loan 
Document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the 
Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all or other 
Lenders) as it deems appropriate or it shall first be indemnified to its 
satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense that 
may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such 
action. Each Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in 
refraining from acting, under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents 
in accordance with a request of the Required Lenders (or, if so specified 
by this Agreement, all or other Lenders), and such request and any action 
taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the 
Lenders and all future holders of the Loans.

Section 8.05 Notice of Default. Neither Agent shall be deemed to have 
knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default 
unless such Agent has received written notice from a Lender, Holdings or 
the Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event 
of Default and stating that such notice is a notice of default. In the 
event that the Administrative Agent receives such a notice, the 
Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Lenders. The 
Administrative Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or 
Event of Default as shall be reasonably directed by the Required Lenders 
(or, if so specified by this Agreement, all or other Lenders); provided, 
that unless and until the Administrative Agent shall have received such 
directions, the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) 
take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such 
Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable in the best 
interests of the Lenders.
 
167

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Section 8.06 Non-Reliance on Agents and Other Lenders. Each Lender 
expressly acknowledges that neither the Agents nor any of their respective 
officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates 
have made any representations or warranties to it and that no act by any 
Agent hereafter taken, including any review of the affairs of a Loan Party 
or any affiliate of a Loan Party, shall be deemed to constitute any 
representation or warranty by any Agent to any Lender. Each Lender 
represents to the Agents that it has, independently and without reliance 
upon any Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and 
information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of, and 
investigation into the business, operations, property, financial and other 
condition and creditworthiness of, the Loan Parties and their affiliates 
and made its own decision to make its Loans hereunder and enter into this 
Agreement. Each Lender also represents that it will, independently and 
without reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender, and based on such 
documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, 
continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in 
taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan 
Documents, and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform 
itself as to the business, operations, property, financial and other 
condition and creditworthiness of the Loan Parties and their affiliates. 
Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be 
furnished to the Lenders by the Administrative Agent hereunder, the 
Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide 
any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business, 
operations, property, condition (financial or otherwise), prospects or 
creditworthiness of any Loan Party or any affiliate of a Loan Party that 
may come into the possession of the Administrative Agent or any of its 
officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates.

Section 8.07 Indemnification. The Lenders agree to indemnify each Agent and 
the Revolving Facility Lenders agree to indemnify each Issuing Bank, in 
each case in its capacity as such (to the extent not reimbursed by Holdings 
or the Borrower and without limiting the obligation of Holdings or the 
Borrower to do so), in the amount of its pro rata share (based on its 
aggregate Revolving Facility Credit Exposure and, in the case of the 
indemnification of each Agent, outstanding Term Loans and unused 
Commitments hereunder; provided, that the aggregate principal amount of 
Swingline Loans owing to the Swingline Lender and of L/C Disbursements 
owing to any Issuing Bank shall be considered to be owed to the Revolving 
Facility Lenders ratably in accordance with their respective Revolving 
Facility Credit Exposure) (determined at the time such indemnity is 
sought), from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, 
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or 
disbursements of any kind whatsoever that may at any time (whether before 
or after the payment of the Loans) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted 
against such Agent or such Issuing Bank in any way relating to or arising 
out of the Commitments, this Agreement, any of the other Loan Documents or 
any documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the 
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted 
by such Agent or such Issuing Bank under or in connection with any of the 
foregoing; provided, that no Lender shall be liable for the payment of any 
portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, 
actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements that are found 
by a final and nonappealable
 
168

------------------------------------------------------------------------
decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from such 
Agents or such Issuing Banks gross negligence or willful misconduct. The 
failure of any Lender to reimburse any Agent or any Issuing Bank, as the 
case may be, promptly upon demand for its ratable share of any amount 
required to be paid by the Lenders to such Agent or such Issuing Bank, as 
the case may be, as provided herein shall not relieve any other Lender of 
its obligation hereunder to reimburse such Agent or such Issuing Bank, as 
the case may be, for its ratable share of such amount, but no Lender shall 
be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to reimburse such Agent 
or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, for such other Lenders ratable 
share of such amount. The agreements in this Section shall survive the 
payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.

Section 8.08 Agent in Its Individual Capacity. Each Agent and its 
affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from, and generally engage in 
any kind of business with any Loan Party as though such Agent were not an 
Agent. With respect to its Loans made or renewed by it and with respect to 
any Letter of Credit issued, or Letter of Credit or Swingline Loan 
participated in, by it, each Agent shall have the same rights and powers 
under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as any Lender and may 
exercise the same as though it were not an Agent, and the terms Lender 
and Lenders shall include each Agent in its individual capacity.

Section 8.09 Successor Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may 
resign as Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent upon 10 days notice to 
the Lenders and the Borrower. If the Administrative Agent shall resign as 
Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent under this Agreement and the 
other Loan Documents, then the Required Lenders shall have the right, 
subject to the reasonable consent of the Borrower (so long as no Event of 
Default under Section 7.01(b), (c), (h) or (i) shall have occurred and be 
continuing), to appoint a successor which shall be a bank with an office in 
the United States, or an Affiliate of any such bank with an office in the 
United States, whereupon such successor agent shall succeed to the rights, 
powers and duties of the Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent, and the 
term Administrative Agent shall mean such successor agent effective upon 
such appointment and approval, and the former Administrative Agents 
rights, powers and duties as Administrative Agent shall be terminated, 
without any other or further act or deed on the part of such former 
Administrative Agent or any of the parties to this Agreement or any holders 
of the Loans. If no successor agent has accepted appointment as 
Administrative Agent by the date that is 10 days following a retiring 
Administrative Agents notice of resignation, the retiring Administrative 
Agents resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become effective (except 
in the case of the Collateral Agent holding collateral security on behalf 
of such Secured Parties, the retiring Collateral Agent shall continue to 
hold such collateral security as nominee until such time as a successor 
Collateral Agent is appointed), and the Lenders shall assume and perform 
all of the duties of the Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent 
hereunder until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a 
successor agent as provided for above. After any retiring Administrative 
Agents resignation as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Section 
8.09 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be 
taken by it while it was Administrative Agent under this Agreement and the 
other Loan Documents.
 
169

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Section 8.10 Arrangers, Syndication Agent and Documentation Agent. 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or any provision of 
any other Loan Document, each of the persons named on the cover page hereof 
as Joint Bookrunner, Joint Lead Arranger, Syndication Agent or 
Documentation Agent is named as such for recognition purposes only, and in 
its capacity as such shall have no rights, duties, responsibilities or 
liabilities with respect to this Agreement or any other Loan Document, 
except that each such person and its Affiliates shall be entitled to the 
rights expressly stated to be applicable to them in Section 9.05 and 9.17 
(subject to the applicable obligations and limitations as set forth 
therein).

Section 8.11 Security Documents, Collateral Agent and Collateral Agent. The 
Lenders authorize the Collateral Agent to release any Collateral or 
Guarantors in accordance with Section 9.18 or if approved, authorized or 
ratified in accordance with Section 9.08.

The Lenders hereby irrevocably authorize and instruct the Collateral Agent 
to, without any further consent of any Lender, enter into (or acknowledge 
and consent to) or amend, renew, extend, supplement, restate, replace, 
waive or otherwise modify any First Lien/First Lien Intercreditor 
Agreement, any First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement, any 
Permitted Junior Intercreditor Agreement, any Permitted Pari Passu 
Intercreditor Agreement or any other intercreditor agreement with the 
collateral agent or other representatives of the holders of Indebtedness 
that is permitted to be secured by a Lien on the Collateral that is 
permitted (including with respect to priority) under this Agreement and to 
subject the Liens on the Collateral securing the Obligations to the 
provisions thereof. The Lenders irrevocably agree that (x) the Collateral 
Agent may rely exclusively on a certificate of a Responsible Officer of the 
Borrower as to whether any such other Liens are permitted and (y) any First 
Lien/First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, any First Lien/Second Lien 
Intercreditor Agreement or any other intercreditor agreement referred to in 
the foregoing sentence, entered into by the Collateral Agent, shall be 
binding on the Secured Parties, and each Lender hereby agrees that it will 
take no actions contrary to the provisions, if entered into and if 
applicable, any Permitted Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement or any 
Permitted Junior Intercreditor Agreement. The foregoing provisions are 
intended as an inducement to any future providers of Indebtedness not 
prohibited by Section 6.01 hereof to extend credit to the Loan Parties and 
such persons are intended third-party beneficiaries of such provisions. 
Furthermore, the Lenders (including in their capacities as potential Cash 
Management Banks and potential Hedge Banks) hereby authorize the 
Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent to release any Lien on any 
property granted to or held by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral 
Agent under any Loan Document (i) to the holder of any Lien on such 
property that is permitted by clauses (c), (i), (j) and (aa) of Section 
6.02 or Section 6.02(a) (if the Liens thereunder are of a type that is 
contemplated by any of the foregoing clauses) in each case to the extent 
the contract or agreement pursuant to which such Lien is granted prohibits 
any other Liens on such property or (ii) that is or becomes Excluded 
Property; and the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent shall do so 
upon request of the Borrower; provided, that prior to any such request, the 
Borrower shall have in each case delivered to the Administrative Agent a 
certificate of a Responsible Officer of the Borrower certifying (x) that 
such Lien is permitted under this Agreement, (y) in the case of a request 
pursuant to clause (i) of this sentence, that the contract or agreement 
pursuant to which such Lien is granted prohibits any other Lien on such 
property and (z) in the case of a request pursuant to clause (ii) of this 
sentence, that (A) such property is or has become Excluded Property and (B) 
if such property has become Excluded Property as a result of a contractual 
restriction, such restriction does not violate Section 6.09(c).
 
170

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Section 8.12 Right to Realize on Collateral and Enforce Guarantees. In case 
of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, 
reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial 
proceeding relative to any Loan Party, (i) the Administrative Agent 
(irrespective of whether the principal of any Obligation shall then be due 
and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and 
irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand 
on the Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such 
proceeding or otherwise (A) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount 
of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of any or all of 
the Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents 
as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the 
Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the Administrative Agent and any Subagents 
allowed in such judicial proceeding, and (B) to collect and receive any 
monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to 
distribute the same, and (ii) any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, 
liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial 
proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender and Issuing Bank to make 
such payments to the Administrative Agent and, if the Administrative Agent 
shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Lenders and 
the Issuing Banks, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for 
the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the 
Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due 
the Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents. Nothing contained herein 
shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative Agent to authorize or 
consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender or Issuing Bank any 
plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting 
the Obligations or the rights of any Lender or Issuing Bank or to authorize 
the Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender or 
Issuing Bank in any such proceeding.

Anything contained in any of the Loan Documents to the contrary 
notwithstanding, the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Collateral 
Agent and each Secured Party hereby agree that (a) no Secured Party shall 
have any right individually to realize upon any of the Collateral or to 
enforce the Guarantee, it being understood and agreed that all powers, 
rights and remedies hereunder may be exercised solely by the Administrative 
Agent, on behalf of the Secured Parties in accordance with the terms hereof 
and all powers, rights and remedies under the Security Documents may be 
exercised solely by the Collateral Agent, and (b) in the event of a 
foreclosure by the Collateral Agent on any of the Collateral pursuant to a 
public or private sale or other disposition, the Collateral Agent or any 
Lender may be the purchaser or licensor of any or all of such Collateral at 
any such sale or other disposition and the Collateral Agent, as agent for 
and representative of the Secured Parties (but not any Lender or Lenders in 
its or their respective individual capacities unless the Required Lenders 
shall otherwise agree in writing) shall be entitled, for the purpose of 
bidding and making settlement or payment of the purchase price for all or 
any portion of the Collateral sold at any such public sale, to use and 
apply any of the Obligations as a credit on account of the purchase price 
for any collateral payable by the Collateral Agent at such sale or other 
Disposition.

Section 8.13 Withholding Tax. To the extent required by any applicable 
Requirement of Law, the Administrative Agent may withhold from any payment 
to any Lender an amount equivalent to any applicable withholding Tax. If 
the Internal Revenue Service or any authority of the United States or other 
jurisdiction asserts a claim that the Administrative Agent
 
171

------------------------------------------------------------------------
did not properly withhold Tax from amounts paid to or for the account of 
any Lender for any reason (including because the appropriate form was not 
delivered, was not properly executed, or because such Lender failed to 
notify the Administrative Agent of a change in circumstances that rendered 
the exemption from, or reduction of, withholding Tax ineffective), such 
Lender shall indemnify the Administrative Agent (to the extent that the 
Administrative Agent has not already been reimbursed by any applicable Loan 
Party and without limiting the obligation of any applicable Loan Party to 
do so) fully for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the 
Administrative Agent as Tax or otherwise, including penalties, fines, 
additions to Tax and interest, together with all expenses incurred, 
including legal expenses, allocated staff costs and any out of pocket 
expenses. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off 
and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under this 
Agreement or any other Loan Document against any amount due to the 
Administrative Agent under this Section 8.13.

representations and warranties made by the Loan Parties herein, in the 
other Loan Documents and in the certificates or other instruments prepared 
or delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement or any other 
Loan Document shall be considered to have been relied upon by the Lenders 
and each Issuing Bank and shall survive the making by the Lenders of the 
Loans and the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents and the issuance 
of the Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by such 
persons or on their behalf, and shall continue in full force and effect 
until the Termination Date. Without prejudice to the survival of any other 
agreements contained herein, indemnification and reimbursement obligations 
contained herein (including pursuant to Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.05) 
shall survive the Termination Date.

Section 9.03 Binding Effect. This Agreement shall become effective when it 
shall have been executed by Holdings, the Borrower and the Administrative 
Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received copies hereof 
which, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other 
parties hereto, and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the 
benefit of Holdings, the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, each Issuing 
Bank and each Lender and their respective permitted successors and assigns.

Section 9.04 Successors and Assigns. (a) The provisions of this Agreement 
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and 
their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any 
Affiliate of the Issuing Bank that issues any Letter of Credit), except 
that (i) the Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its 
rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each 
Lender (and any attempted assignment or transfer by the Borrower without 
such consent shall be null and void) and (ii) no Lender may assign or 
otherwise transfer its rights or obligations hereunder except in accordance 
with this Section 9.04. Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, 
shall be construed to confer upon any person (other than the parties 
hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby (including 
any Affiliate of the Issuing Bank that issues any Letter of Credit), 
Participants (to the extent provided in clause (c) of this Section 9.04), 
and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of 
each of the Agents, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders) any legal or 
equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement or 
the other Loan Documents.

(b) (i) Subject to the conditions set forth in subclause (ii) below, any 
Lender may assign to one or more assignees (each, an Assignee) all or a 
portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all 
or a portion of its Commitments and the Loans at the time owing to it) with 
the prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or 
delayed) of:

(A) the Borrower, which consent, with respect to the assignment of a Term 
Loan, will be deemed to have been given if the Borrower has not responded 
within ten (10) Business Days after the delivery of any request for such 
consent; provided, that no consent of the Borrower shall be required for an 
assignment of a Term Loan to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender, an 
Approved Fund (as defined below), or in the case of assignments during the 
primary syndication of the Commitments and Loans to persons identified to 
and agreed by the Borrower in writing prior to the Closing Date, or for an 
assignment of a Revolving Facility Commitment or Revolving Facility Loan to 
a Revolving Facility Lender, an Affiliate of a Revolving Facility Lender or 
Approved Fund with respect to a Revolving Facility Lender, or, in each 
case, if an Event of Default under Section 7.01(b), (c), (h) or (i) has 
occurred and is continuing, any other person; and

(B) the Administrative Agent; provided, that no consent of the 
Administrative Agent shall be required for an assignment of all or any 
portion of a Term Loan to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender, an Approved 
Fund or an Affiliate of the Borrower made in accordance with Section 
9.04(i) or Section 9.21; and
 
174

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(C) the Issuing Bank and the Swingline Lender; provided, that no consent of 
the Issuing Bank and the Swingline Lender shall be required for an 
assignment of all or any portion of a Term Loan.

(ii) Assignments shall be subject to the following additional conditions:

(A) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a 
Lender or an Approved Fund or an assignment of the entire remaining amount 
of the assigning Lenders Commitments or Loans under any Facility, the 
amount of the Commitments or Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each 
such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Acceptance 
with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) 
shall not be less than (x) $1,000,000 in the case of Term Loans and (y) 
$5,000,000 in the case of Revolving Facility Loans or Revolving Facility 
Commitments, unless each of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent 
otherwise consent; provided, that such amounts shall be aggregated in 
respect of each Lender and its Affiliates or Approved Funds (with 
simultaneous assignments to or by two or more Related Funds shall be 
treated as one assignment), if any;

(B) the parties to each assignment shall (1) execute and deliver to the 
Administrative Agent an Assignment and Acceptance via an electronic 
settlement system acceptable to the Administrative Agent or (2) if 
previously agreed with the Administrative Agent, manually execute and 
deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Acceptance, in each 
case together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500 (which fee 
may be waived or reduced in the reasonable discretion of the Administrative 
Agent);

(C) the Assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the 
Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire and any tax forms 
required to be delivered pursuant to Section 2.17; and

(D) the Assignee shall not be the Borrower or any of the Borrowers 
Affiliates or Subsidiaries except in accordance with Section 9.04(i) or 
Section 9.21.

For the purposes of this Section 9.04, Approved Fund means any person 
(other than a natural person) that is engaged in making, purchasing, 
holding or investing in bank loans and similar extensions of credit in the 
ordinary course and that is administered or managed by (a) a Lender, (b) an 
Affiliate of a Lender or (c) an entity or an Affiliate of an entity that 
administers or
 
175

------------------------------------------------------------------------
manages a Lender. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary 
herein, no Lender shall be permitted to assign or transfer any portion of 
its rights and obligations under this Agreement to (A) any Ineligible 
Institution, (B) any Defaulting Lender or any of its Subsidiaries, or any 
person who, upon becoming a Lender hereunder, would constitute any of the 
foregoing persons described in this clause (B), or (C) a natural person. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Loan Party and the Lenders acknowledge 
and agree that the Administrative Agent shall not have any responsibility 
or obligation to determine whether any Lender or potential Lender is an 
Ineligible Institution and the Administrative Agent shall have no liability 
with respect to any assignment made to an Ineligible Institution. Any 
assigning Lender shall, in connection with any potential assignment, 
provide to the Borrower a copy of its request (including the name of the 
prospective assignee) concurrently with its delivery of the same request to 
the Administrative Agent irrespective of whether or not an Event of Default 
under Section 7.01(b), (c), (h) or (i) has occurred and is continuing.

(iii) Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to subclause (v) 
below, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and 
Acceptance the Assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the 
extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, have the 
rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning 
Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such 
Assignment and Acceptance, be released from its obligations under this 
Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all of 
the assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement, such 
Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled 
to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.05 (subject to the 
limitations and requirements of those Sections)); provided, that an 
Assignee shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment pursuant to 
Section 2.17 than the applicable Assignor would have been entitled to 
receive had no such assignment occurred. Any assignment or transfer by a 
Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply 
with this Section 9.04 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a 
sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in 
accordance with clause (c) of this Section 9.04.

(iv) The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as a non-fiduciary 
agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices a copy of each 
Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register for the 
recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments 
of, and principal and interest amounts of the Loans and Revolving L/C 
Exposure owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to 
time (the Register). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive 
absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the 
Issuing Bank, the Swingline Lender and the Lenders shall treat each person 
whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a 
Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice 
to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the 
Borrower, the Issuing Bank, the Swingline Lender and any Lender, at any 
reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

(v) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Acceptance executed 
by an assigning Lender and an Assignee, the Assignees completed 
Administrative Questionnaire (unless the Assignee shall already be a Lender 
hereunder),
 
176

------------------------------------------------------------------------
the processing and recordation fee referred to in clause (b) of this 
Section, if applicable, and any written consent to such assignment required 
by clause (b) of this Section and any applicable tax forms, the 
Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Acceptance and 
promptly record the information contained therein in the Register. No 
assignment, whether or not evidenced by a promissory note, shall be 
effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the 
Register as provided in this subclause (v).

(c) [Reserved].

(d) (i) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower or the 
Administrative Agent, sell participations in Loans and Commitments to one 
or more banks or other entities other than any Ineligible Institution (to 
the extent that the list of Ineligible Institutions has been made available 
to all Lenders) (a Participant) in all or a portion of such Lenders 
rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of 
its Commitments and the Loans owing to it); provided, that (A) such 
Lenders obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (B) such 
Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the 
performance of such obligations and (C) the Borrower, the Administrative 
Agent, the Issuing Bank and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely 
and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lenders rights and 
obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement pursuant to which a Lender 
sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the 
sole right to enforce this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and to 
approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this 
Agreement and the other Loan Documents; provided, that (x) such agreement 
may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the 
Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver that (1) 
requires the consent of each Lender directly affected thereby pursuant to 
clauses (i), (ii), (iii) or (vi) of the first proviso to Section 9.08(b) 
and (2) directly affects such Participant (but, for the avoidance of doubt, 
not any waiver of any Default or Event of Default) and (y) no other 
agreement with respect to amendment, modification or waiver may exist 
between such Lender and such Participant. Subject to clause (d)(iii) of 
this Section 9.04, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be 
entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16 and 2.17 (subject to the 
limitations and requirements of those Sections and Section 2.19) to the 
same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by 
assignment pursuant to clause (b) of this Section 9.04. To the extent 
permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits 
of Section 9.06 as though it were a Lender; provided, that such Participant 
shall be subject to Section 2.18(c) as though it were a Lender. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Loan Party and the Lenders acknowledge 
and agree that the Administrative Agent shall not have any responsibility 
or obligation to determine whether any Participant or potential Participant 
is an Ineligible Institution and the Administrative Agent shall have no 
liability with respect to any participation made to an Ineligible 
Institution.

(ii) Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this 
purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on 
which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal 
amounts and interest amounts of each Participants interest in the Loans or 
other obligations under the Loan Documents (the Participant Register). 
The entries in the Participant Register shall be
 
177

------------------------------------------------------------------------
conclusive absent manifest error, and each party hereto shall treat each 
person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of 
such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any 
notice to the contrary. Without limitation of the requirements of Section 
9.04(d), no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion 
of a Participant Register to any person (including the identity of any 
Participant or any information relating to a Participants interest in any 
Commitments, Loans or other Loan Obligations under any Loan Document), 
except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that 
such Commitment, Loan or other Loan Obligation is in registered form for 
U.S. federal income tax purposes or is otherwise required by applicable 
law.

(iii) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment 
under Section 2.15, 2.16 or 2.17 than the applicable Lender would have been 
entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such 
Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is 
made with the Borrowers prior written consent (not to be unreasonably 
withheld or delayed), which consent shall state that it is being given 
pursuant to this Section 9.04(d)(iii); provided, that each potential 
Participant shall provide such information as is reasonably requested by 
the Borrower in order for the Borrower to determine whether to provide its 
consent.

(e) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all 
or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of 
such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a 
Federal Reserve Bank and in the case of any Lender that is an Approved 
Fund, any pledge or assignment to any holders of obligations owed, or 
securities issued, by such Lender, including to any trustee for, or any 
other representative of, such holders, and this Section 9.04 shall not 
apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided, 
that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a 
Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee 
or Assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

(f) The Borrower, upon receipt of written notice from the relevant Lender, 
agrees to issue Notes to any Lender requiring Notes to facilitate 
transactions of the type described in clause (e) above.

(g) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Conduit Lender may assign any or all 
of the Loans it may have funded hereunder to its designating Lender without 
the consent of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent. Each of Holdings, 
the Borrower, each Lender and the Administrative Agent hereby confirms that 
it will not institute against a Conduit Lender or join any other person in 
instituting against a Conduit Lender any bankruptcy, reorganization, 
arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceeding under any state 
bankruptcy or similar law, for one year and one day after the payment in 
full of the latest maturing commercial paper note issued by such Conduit 
Lender; provided, however, that each Lender designating any Conduit Lender 
hereby agrees to indemnify, save and hold harmless each other party hereto 
and each Loan Party for any loss, cost, damage or expense arising out of 
its inability to institute such a proceeding against such Conduit Lender 
during such period of forbearance.
 
178

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(h) If the Borrower wishes to replace the Loans or Commitments under any 
Facility with ones having different terms, it shall have the option, with 
the consent of the Administrative Agent and subject to at least three 
Business Days advance notice to the Lenders under such Facility, instead 
of prepaying the Loans or reducing or terminating the Commitments to be 
replaced, to (i) require the Lenders under such Facility to assign such 
Loans or Commitments to the Administrative Agent or its designees and (ii) 
amend the terms thereof in accordance with Section 9.08 (with such 
replacement, if applicable, being deemed to have been made pursuant to 
Section 9.08(d)). Pursuant to any such assignment, all Loans and 
Commitments to be replaced shall be purchased at par (allocated among the 
Lenders under such Facility in the same manner as would be required if such 
Loans were being optionally prepaid or such Commitments were being 
optionally reduced or terminated by the Borrower), accompanied by payment 
of any accrued interest and fees thereon and any amounts owing pursuant to 
Section 9.05(b). By receiving such purchase price, the Lenders under such 
Facility shall automatically be deemed to have assigned the Loans or 
Commitments under such Facility pursuant to the terms of the form of 
Assignment and Acceptance attached hereto as Exhibit A, and accordingly no 
other action by such Lenders shall be required in connection therewith. The 
provisions of this clause (h) are intended to facilitate the maintenance of 
the perfection and priority of existing security interests in the 
Collateral during any such replacement.

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, including 
Section 2.18(c) (which provisions shall not be applicable to clauses (i) or 
(j) of this Section 9.04), any of Holdings or its Subsidiaries, including 
the Borrower, may purchase by way of assignment and become an Assignee with 
respect to Term Loans at any time and from time to time from Lenders in 
accordance with Section 9.04(b) hereof (each, a Permitted Loan Purchase
); provided, that, in respect of any Permitted Loan Purchase, (A) any such 
purchase occurs pursuant to Dutch auction procedures open to all Lenders of 
the relevant Class of Term Loans on a pro rata basis in accordance with 
customary procedures to be agreed between the Borrower and the 
Administrative Agent; provided, that any of Holdings or its Subsidiaries, 
including the Borrower shall be entitled to make open market purchases of 
the Term Loans without complying with such Dutch auction procedures so long 
as the aggregate principal amount (calculated on the par amount thereof) of 
all Term Loans purchased in open market purchases from the Closing Date 
does not exceed the Permitted Loan Purchase Amount, (B) no Permitted Loan 
Purchase shall be made from the proceeds of any extensions of credit under 
the Revolving Facility, (C) upon consummation of any such Permitted Loan 
Purchase, the Loans purchased pursuant thereto shall be deemed to be 
automatically and immediately cancelled and extinguished in accordance with 
Section 9.04(j), (D) in connection with any such Permitted Loan Purchase, 
any of Holdings or its Subsidiaries, including the Borrower, and such 
Lender that is the Assignor shall execute and deliver to the Administrative 
Agent a Permitted Loan Purchase Assignment and Acceptance (and for the 
avoidance of doubt, (x) shall make the representations and warranties set 
forth in the Permitted Loan Purchase Assignment and Acceptance and (y) 
shall not be required to execute and deliver an Assignment and Acceptance 
pursuant to Section 9.04(b)(ii)(B)) and shall otherwise comply with the 
conditions to Assignments under this Section 9.04 and (E) no Default or 
Event of Default would exist after giving effect on a Pro Forma Basis to 
such Permitted Loan Purchase.
 
179

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(j) Each Permitted Loan Purchase shall, for purposes of this Agreement be 
deemed to be an automatic and immediate cancellation and extinguishment of 
such Term Loans and the Borrower shall, upon consummation of any Permitted 
Loan Purchase, notify the Administrative Agent that the Register be updated 
to record such event as if it were a prepayment of such Loans.

(k) In connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any 
Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective unless 
and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, 
the parties to the assignment shall make such additional payments to the 
Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution 
thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the 
assignee of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating 
actions, including funding, with the consent of the Borrower and the 
Administrative Agent, the applicable pro rata share of Loans previously 
requested but not funded by the Defaulting Lender, to each of which the 
applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (x) pay 
and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting 
Lender to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder (and interest 
accrued thereon) and (y) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full pro 
rata share of all Loans and participations in Letters of Credit and 
Swingline Loans in accordance with its Revolving Facility Percentage; 
provided, that notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any 
assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder 
shall become effective under applicable law without compliance with the 
provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of such interest shall be 
deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until 
such compliance occurs.

(l) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the rights of the 
Lenders to make assignments and grant participations shall be subject to 
the approval of any Gaming Authority, to the extent required by any 
applicable Gaming Laws.

Section 9.05 Expenses; Indemnity. (a) The Borrower agrees to pay (i) all 
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses (including Other Taxes) 
incurred by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent in connection 
with the preparation of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, or by 
the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent in connection with the 
administration of this Agreement and any amendments, modifications or 
waivers of the provisions hereof or thereof, including the reasonable fees, 
charges and disbursements of Cahill Gordon & Reindel LLP, counsel for the 
Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Arrangers, and, if 
necessary, the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of one local 
counsel per jurisdiction, and (ii) all out-of-pocket expenses (including 
Other Taxes) incurred by the Agents or any Lender in connection with the 
enforcement of their rights in connection with this Agreement and the other 
Loan Documents, in connection with the Loans made or the Letters of Credit 
issued hereunder, including the fees, charges and disbursements of a single 
counsel for all such persons, taken as a whole, and, if necessary, a single 
local counsel in each appropriate jurisdiction for all such persons, taken 
as a whole (and, in the case of an actual or perceived conflict of interest 
where such person affected by such conflict informs the Borrower of such 
conflict and thereafter retains its own counsel with the Borrowers prior 
written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld), of another firm of such 
for such affected person).
 
180

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(b) The Borrower agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent, the 
Collateral Agent, the Arrangers, the Joint Bookrunners, each Issuing Bank, 
each Lender, the Syndication Agent, the Documentation Agent, each of their 
respective Affiliates, successors and assignors, and each of their 
respective directors, trustees, officers, employees, agents, trustees and 
advisors, (each such person being called an Indemnitee) against, and to 
hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, 
liabilities and related expenses, including reasonable counsel fees, 
charges and disbursements (excluding the allocated costs of in house 
counsel and limited to not more than one counsel for all such Indemnitees, 
taken as a whole, and, if necessary, a single local counsel in each 
appropriate jurisdiction for all such Indemnitees, taken as a whole (and, 
in the case of an actual or perceived conflict of interest where the 
Indemnitee affected by such conflict informs the Borrower of such conflict 
and thereafter retains its own counsel with the Borrowers prior written 
consent (not to be unreasonably withheld), of another firm of counsel for 
such affected Indemnitee)), incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee 
arising out of, in any way connected with, or as a result of (i) the 
execution or delivery of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any 
agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby, the performance by 
the parties hereto and thereto of their respective obligations thereunder 
or the consummation of the Transactions and the other transactions 
contemplated hereby, (ii) the use of the proceeds of the Loans or the use 
of any Letter of Credit, (iii) any violation of or liability under 
Environmental Laws by the Borrower or any Subsidiary, (iv) any actual or 
alleged presence, Release or threatened Release of or exposure to Hazardous 
Materials at, under, on, from or to any property owned, leased or operated 
by the Borrower or any Subsidiary or (v) any claim, litigation, 
investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether or 
not any Indemnitee is a party thereto and regardless of whether such matter 
is initiated by a third party or by Holdings, the Borrower or any of their 
subsidiaries or Affiliates; provided, that such indemnity shall not, as to 
any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, 
damages, liabilities or related expenses (x) are determined by a final, 
non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction to have 
resulted from the gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of such 
Indemnitee or any of its Related Parties, (y) arose from a material breach 
of such Indemnitees or any of its Related Parties obligations under any 
Loan Document (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a 
final, non-appealable judgment) or (z) arose from any claim, actions, 
suits, inquiries, litigation, investigation or proceeding that does not 
involve an act or omission of the Borrower or any of its Affiliates and is 
brought by an Indemnitee against another Indemnitee (other than any claim, 
actions, suits, inquiries, litigation, investigation or proceeding against 
any Agent or an Arranger in its capacity as such). None of the Indemnitees 
(or any of their respective affiliates) shall be responsible or liable to 
the Fund, Holdings, the Borrower or any of their respective subsidiaries, 
Affiliates or stockholders or any other person or entity for any special, 
indirect, consequential or punitive damages, which may be alleged as a 
result of the Facilities or the Transactions. The provisions of this 
Section 9.05 shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless 
of the expiration of the term of this Agreement, the consummation of the 
transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of any of the Obligations, 
the invalidity or unenforceability of any term or provision of this 
Agreement or any other Loan Document, or any investigation made by or on 
behalf of the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender. All 
amounts due under this Section 9.05 shall be payable within fifteen (15) 
days of written demand therefor accompanied by reasonable documentation 
with respect to any reimbursement, indemnification or other amount 
requested.
 
181

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(c) Except as expressly provided in Section 9.05(a) with respect to Other 
Taxes, which shall not be duplicative with any amounts paid pursuant to 
Section 2.17, this Section 9.05 shall not apply to any Taxes (other than 
Taxes that represent losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related 
expenses resulting from a non-Tax claim), which shall be governed 
exclusively by Section 2.17 and, to the extent set forth therein, Section 
2.15.

(d) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Holdings and the 
Borrower shall not assert, and hereby waive, any claim against any 
Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, 
consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) 
arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement, any 
other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the 
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, any Loan or Letter of Credit 
or the use of the proceeds thereof. No Indemnitee shall be liable for any 
damages arising from the use by unintended recipients of any information or 
other materials distributed by it through telecommunications, electronic or 
other information transmission systems in connection with this Agreement or 
the other Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or 
thereby.

(e) The agreements in this Section 9.05 shall survive the resignation of 
the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Issuing Bank, the 
replacement of any Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the 
repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all the other Obligations and the 
termination of this Agreement.

Section 9.06 Right of Set-off. If an Event of Default shall have occurred 
and be continuing, each Lender and each Issuing Bank is hereby authorized 
at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, 
to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or 
demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other indebtedness at 
any time owing by such Lender or such Issuing Bank to or for the credit or 
the account of Holdings (prior to a Qualified IPO), the Borrower or any 
Subsidiary against any of and all the obligations of Holdings (prior to a 
Qualified IPO) or the Borrower now or hereafter existing under this 
Agreement or any other Loan Document held by such Lender or such Issuing 
Bank, irrespective of whether or not such Lender or such Issuing Bank shall 
have made any demand under this Agreement or such other Loan Document and 
although the obligations may be unmatured; provided, that in the event that 
any Defaulting Lender shall exercise any such right of setoff, (x) all 
amounts so set off shall be paid over immediately to the Administrative 
Agent for further application in accordance with the provisions of Section 
2.22 and, pending such payment, shall be segregated by such Defaulting 
Lender from its other funds and deemed held in trust for the benefit of the 
Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and (y) the Defaulting Lender shall 
provide promptly to the Administrative Agent a statement describing in 
reasonable detail the Obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender as to 
which it exercised such right of setoff. The rights of each Lender and each 
Issuing Bank under this Section 9.06 are in addition to other rights and 
remedies (including other rights of set-off) that such Lender or such 
Issuing Bank may have.

Section 9.07 Applicable Law. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS 
AND ANY CLAIMS, CONTROVERSY, DISPUTE OR CAUSES OF ACTION (WHETHER IN 
CONTRACT OR TORT OR OTHERWISE) BASED UPON, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO 
THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN

DOCUMENT (OTHER THAN AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS) SHALL 
BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF 
NEW YORK, WITHOUT REGARD TO ANY PRINCIPLE OF CONFLICTS OF LAW THAT COULD 
REQUIRE THE APPLICATION OF ANY OTHER LAW.

Section 9.08 Waivers; Amendment. (a) No failure or delay of the 
Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender in exercising any 
right or power hereunder or under any Loan Document shall operate as a 
waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right 
or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a 
right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the 
exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the 
Administrative Agent, each Issuing Bank and the Lenders hereunder and under 
the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights 
or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of 
this Agreement or any other Loan Document or consent to any departure by 
Holdings, the Borrower or any other Loan Party therefrom shall in any event 
be effective unless the same shall be permitted by clause (b) below, and 
then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific 
instance and for the purpose for which given. No notice or demand on 
Holdings, the Borrower or any other Loan Party in any case shall entitle 
such person to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other 
circumstances.

(b) Neither this Agreement nor any other Loan Document nor any provision 
hereof or thereof may be waived, amended or modified except (x) as provided 
in Section 2.21, (y) in the case of this Agreement, pursuant to an 
agreement or agreements in writing entered into by Holdings (prior to a 
Qualified IPO), the Borrower and the Required Lenders (or, in respect of 
any waiver, amendment or modification of Section 4.01 after the Closing 
Date, solely as relates to the Revolving Facility Loans and Letters of 
Credit, the Required Revolving Facility Lenders voting as a single Class, 
rather than the Required Lenders), and (z) in the case of any other Loan 
Document, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by 
each Loan Party party thereto and the Administrative Agent and consented to 
by the Required Lenders; provided, however, that no such agreement shall:

(i) decrease or forgive the principal amount of, or extend the final 
maturity of, or decrease the rate of interest on, any Loan or any L/C 
Disbursement, or extend the stated expiration of any Letter of Credit 
beyond the applicable Revolving Facility Maturity Date (except as provided 
in Section 2.05(c)), without the prior written consent of each Lender 
directly adversely affected thereby (which, notwithstanding the foregoing, 
such consent of such Lender directly adversely affected thereby shall be 
the only consent required hereunder to make such modification); provided, 
that any amendment to the financial definitions in this Agreement shall not 
constitute a reduction in the rate of interest for purposes of this clause 
(i),

(ii) increase or extend the Commitment of any Lender, or decrease the 
Commitment Fees, L/C Participation Fees or any other Fees of any Lender 
without the prior written consent of such Lender (which, notwithstanding 
the foregoing, such consent of such Lender shall be the only consent 
required hereunder to make such modification); provided, that waivers or 
modifications of conditions precedent, covenants, Defaults or Events of 
Default or of a mandatory reduction in the aggregate Commitments shall not 
constitute an increase of the Commitments of any Lender,
 
183

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(iii) extend or waive any Term Loan Installment Date or reduce the amount 
due on any Term Loan Installment Date or extend any date on which payment 
of interest on any Loan or any L/C Disbursement or any Fees is due, without 
the prior written consent of each Lender directly adversely affected 
thereby (which, notwithstanding the foregoing, such consent of such Lender 
directly adversely affected thereby shall be the only consent required 
hereunder to make such modification),

(iv) amend the provisions of Section 7.02 in a manner that would by its 
terms alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby, without the 
prior written consent of each Lender adversely affected thereby (which, 
notwithstanding the foregoing, such consent of such Lender directly 
adversely affected thereby shall be the only consent required hereunder to 
make such modification),

(v) amend or modify the provisions of this Section 9.08 or the definition 
of the terms Required Lenders, Majority Lenders or any other provision 
hereof specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, 
amend or modify any rights hereunder or make any determination or grant any 
consent hereunder, without the prior written consent of each Lender 
adversely affected thereby (it being understood that, with the consent of 
the Required Lenders, additional extensions of credit pursuant to this 
Agreement may be included in the determination of the Required Lenders on 
substantially the same basis as the Loans and Commitments are included on 
the Closing Date),

(vi) release all or substantially all of the Collateral or release all or 
substantially all of the Subsidiary Loan Parties from their respective 
Guarantees under the Subsidiary Guarantee Agreement, unless, in the case of 
a Subsidiary Loan Party, all or substantially all of the Equity Interests 
of such Subsidiary Loan Party is sold or otherwise disposed of in a 
transaction permitted by this Agreement or unless, in each case, such 
release is otherwise pursuant to the terms of the Collateral Agreement or 
the Subsidiary Guarantee Agreement, as applicable, without the prior 
written consent of each Lender;

(vii) effect any waiver, amendment or modification that by its terms 
adversely affects the rights in respect of payments or collateral of 
Lenders participating in any Facility differently from those of Lenders 
participating in another Facility, without the consent of the Majority 
Lenders participating in the adversely affected Facility (it being agreed 
that the Required Lenders may waive, in whole or in part, any prepayment or 
Commitment reduction required by Section 2.11 so long as the application of 
any prepayment or Commitment reduction still required to be made is not 
changed);

provided, further, that no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise 
affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent, Swingline Lender 
or an Issuing Bank hereunder without the prior written consent of the 
Administrative Agent, Swingline Lender or such Issuing Bank acting as such 
at the effective date of such agreement, as applicable. Each Lender shall 
be bound by any waiver, amendment or modification authorized by this 
Section 9.08 and any consent by any Lender pursuant to this Section 9.08 
shall bind any Assignee of such Lender.
 
184

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(c) Without the consent of any Lender or Issuing Bank, the Loan Parties and 
the Administrative Agent may (in their respective sole discretion, or 
shall, to the extent required by any Loan Document) enter into any 
amendment, modification or waiver of any Loan Document, or enter into any 
new agreement or instrument, to effect the granting, perfection, 
protection, expansion or enhancement of any security interest in any 
Collateral or additional property to become Collateral for the benefit of 
the Secured Parties, or as required by local law to give effect to, or 
protect any security interest for the benefit of the Secured Parties, in 
any property or so that the security interests therein comply with 
applicable law or this Agreement or in each case to otherwise enhance the 
rights or benefits of any Lender under any Loan Document.

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement may be amended (or 
amended and restated) with the written consent of the Required Lenders, the 
Administrative Agent, Holdings (prior to a Qualified IPO) and the Borrower 
(a) to permit additional extensions of credit to be outstanding hereunder 
from time to time and the accrued interest and fees and other obligations 
in respect thereof to share ratably in the benefits of this Agreement and 
the other Loan Documents with the Term Loans and the Revolving Facility 
Loans and the accrued interest and fees and other obligations in respect 
thereof and (b) to include appropriately the holders of such extensions of 
credit in any determination of the requisite lenders required hereunder, 
including Required Lenders and the Required Revolving Facility Lenders.

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, technical and conforming modifications 
to the Loan Documents may be made with the consent of the Borrower and the 
Administrative Agent (but without the consent of any Lender) to the extent 
necessary (A) to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency or 
(B) to integrate any Incremental Term Loan Commitments or Incremental 
Revolving Facility Commitments in a manner consistent with Section 2.21, 
including, with respect to Other Revolving Loans or Other Term Loans, as 
may be necessary to establish such Incremental Term Loan Commitments or 
Revolving Facility Loans as a separate Class or tranche from the existing 
Term Loan Commitments or Incremental Revolving Facility Commitments, as 
applicable, or (C) to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or 
inconsistency.

(f) Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that the Administrative Agent 
may take any and all action as may be necessary to ensure that all Term 
Loans established pursuant to Section 2.21 after the Closing Date that will 
be included in an existing Class of Term Loans outstanding on such date (an 
Applicable Date), when originally made, are included in each Borrowing of 
outstanding Term Loans of such Class (the Existing Class Loans), on a pro 
rata basis, and/or to ensure that, immediately after giving effect to such 
new Term Loans (the New Class Loans and, together with the Existing Class 
Loans, the Class Loans), each Lender holding Class Loans will be deemed 
to hold its Pro Rata Share of each Class Loan on the Applicable Date (but 
without changing the amount of any such Lenders Term Loans), and each such 
Lender shall be deemed to have effectuated such assignments as shall be 
required to ensure
 
185

------------------------------------------------------------------------
the foregoing. The Pro Rata Share of any Lender on the Applicable Date is 
the ratio of (1) the sum of such Lenders Existing Class Loans immediately 
prior to the Applicable Date plus the amount of New Class Loans made by 
such Lender on the Applicable Date over (2) the aggregate principal amount 
of all Class Loans on the Applicable Date.

(g) With respect to the incurrence of any secured or unsecured Indebtedness 
(including any intercreditor agreement relating thereto), the Borrower may 
elect (in its discretion, but shall not be obligated) to deliver to the 
Administrative Agent a certificate of a Responsible Officer at least three 
Business Days prior to the incurrence thereof (or such shorter time as the 
Administrative Agent may agree), together with either drafts of the 
material documentation relating to such Indebtedness or a description of 
such Indebtedness (including a description of the Liens intended to secure 
the same or the subordination provisions thereof, as applicable) in 
reasonably sufficient detail to be able to make the determinations referred 
to in this paragraph, which certificate shall either, at the Borrowers 
election, (x) state that the Borrower has determined in good faith that 
such Indebtedness satisfies the requirements of the applicable provisions 
of Sections 6.01 and 6.02 (taking into account any other applicable 
provisions of this Section 9.08), in which case such certificate shall be 
conclusive evidence thereof, or (y) request the Administrative Agent to 
confirm, based on the information set forth in such certificate and any 
other information reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent, that 
such Indebtedness satisfies such requirements, in which case the 
Administrative Agent may determine whether, in its reasonable judgment, 
such requirements have been satisfied (in which case it shall deliver to 
the Borrower a written confirmation of the same), with any such 
determination of the Administrative Agent to be conclusive evidence 
thereof, and the Lenders hereby authorize the Administrative Agent to make 
such determinations.

(h) Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement may be amended, waived or 
otherwise modified with the written consent of the Required Revolving 
Facility Lenders (and not the Required Lenders), the Administrative Agent, 
Holdings (prior to a Qualified IPO) and the Borrower with respect to the 
provisions of Section 4.01, solely as they relate to the Revolving Facility 
Loans and Letters of Credit.

Section 9.09 Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding anything herein to 
the contrary, if at any time the applicable interest rate, together with 
all fees and charges that are treated as interest under applicable law 
(collectively, the Charges), as provided for herein or in any other 
document executed in connection herewith, or otherwise contracted for, 
charged, received, taken or reserved by any Lender or any Issuing Bank, 
shall exceed the maximum lawful rate (the Maximum Rate) that may be 
contracted for, charged, taken, received or reserved by such Lender in 
accordance with applicable law, the rate of interest payable hereunder, 
together with all Charges payable to such Lender or such Issuing Bank, 
shall be limited to the Maximum Rate; provided, that such excess amount 
shall be paid to such Lender or such Issuing Bank on subsequent payment 
dates to the extent not exceeding the legal limitation.

Section 9.10 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the other Loan Documents and 
the agreements regarding certain Fees referred to herein constitute the 
entire contract between the parties relative to the subject matter hereof. 
Any previous agreement among or representations from the parties or their 
Affiliates with respect to the subject matter hereof is
 
186

------------------------------------------------------------------------
superseded by this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Notwithstanding 
the foregoing, the Fee Letter shall survive the execution and delivery of 
this Agreement and remain in full force and effect in accordance with its 
terms. Nothing in this Agreement or in the other Loan Documents, expressed 
or implied, is intended to confer upon any party other than the parties 
hereto and thereto any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under 
or by reason of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents.

Section 9.11 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE 
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A 
TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING 
OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE OTHER LOAN 
DOCUMENTS (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY 
HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER 
PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD 
NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND 
(B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO 
ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS, AS APPLICABLE, BY, 
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 
9.11.

Section 9.12 Severability. In the event any one or more of the provisions 
contained in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document should be held 
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the validity, legality 
and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein and therein 
shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. The parties shall 
endeavor in good-faith negotiations to replace the invalid, illegal or 
unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which 
comes as close as possible to that of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable 
provisions.

Section 9.13 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more 
counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original but all of which, 
when taken together, shall constitute but one contract, and shall become 
effective as provided in Section 9.03. Delivery of an executed counterpart 
to this Agreement by facsimile transmission (or other electronic 
transmission pursuant to procedures approved by the Administrative Agent) 
shall be as effective as delivery of a manually signed original.

Section 9.14 Headings. Article and Section headings and the Table of 
Contents used herein are for convenience of reference only, are not part of 
this Agreement and are not to affect the construction of, or to be taken 
into consideration in interpreting, this Agreement.

Section 9.15 Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process. (a) Each of the 
parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself 
and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of any New York State court 
or federal court of the United States of America sitting in New York 
County, and of the United States District Court of the Southern District of 
New York, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or 
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the other Loan 
Documents, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of 
the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally
 
187

------------------------------------------------------------------------
submits to the jurisdiction of such courts and agrees that all claims in 
respect of any such action, litigation or proceeding may be heard and 
determined in such New York State court or, to the fullest extent permitted 
by applicable law, in such federal court. Each of the parties hereto agrees 
that a final judgment in any such action, litigation or proceeding shall be 
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the 
judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement 
or in any other Loan Document shall affect any right that the 
Administrative Agent or any Lender may otherwise have to bring any action 
or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document against 
the Borrower or any other Loan Party or its properties in the courts of any 
jurisdiction.

(b) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally 
waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any 
objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any 
suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or 
the other Loan Documents in any New York State or federal court. Each of 
the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent 
permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance 
of such action or proceeding in any such court.

(c) Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process 
in the manner provided for notices in Section 9.01. Nothing in this 
Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Agreement or any other 
Loan Document to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.

Section 9.16 Confidentiality. Each of the Lenders, each Issuing Bank and 
each of the Agents agrees that it shall maintain in confidence any 
information relating to Holdings, any Parent Entity, the Borrower and any 
Subsidiary furnished to it by or on behalf of Holdings, any Parent Entity, 
the Borrower or any Subsidiary (other than information that (a) has become 
generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by 
such party, (b) has been independently developed by such Lender, such 
Issuing Bank or such Agent without violating this Section 9.16 or (c) was 
available to such Lender, such Issuing Bank or such Agent from a third 
party having, to such persons knowledge, no obligations of confidentiality 
to Holdings, any Parent Entity, the Borrower or any other Loan Party) and 
shall not reveal the same other than to its directors, trustees, officers, 
employees and advisors with a need to know and any numbering, 
administration or settlement service providers or to any person that 
approves or administers the Loans on behalf of such Lender (so long as each 
such person shall have been instructed to keep the same confidential in 
accordance with this Section 9.16), except: (A) to the extent necessary to 
comply with law or any legal process or the requirements of any 
Governmental Authority, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners 
or of any securities exchange on which securities of the disclosing party 
or any Affiliate of the disclosing party are listed or traded, (B) as part 
of normal reporting or review procedures to, or examinations by, 
Governmental Authorities or self-regulatory authorities, including the 
National Association of Insurance Commissioners or the National Association 
of Securities Dealers, Inc., (C) to its parent companies, Affiliates or 
auditors (so long as each such person shall have been instructed to keep 
the same confidential in accordance with this Section 9.16), (D) in order 
to enforce its rights under any Loan Document in a legal proceeding, (E) to 
any pledgee under Section 9.04(d) or any other prospective assignee of, or 
prospective Participant in, any of its rights under this Agreement (so long 
as such person shall have been instructed to keep the same confidential in
 
188

------------------------------------------------------------------------
accordance with this Section 9.16) and (F) to any direct or indirect 
contractual counterparty in Hedging Agreements or such contractual 
counterpartys professional advisor (so long as such contractual 
counterparty or professional advisor to such contractual counterparty 
agrees to be bound by the provisions of this Section 9.16).

Section 9.17 Platform; Borrower Materials. The Borrower hereby acknowledges 
that (a) the Administrative Agent and/or the Arrangers will make available 
to the Lenders and the Issuing Bank materials and/or information provided 
by or on behalf of the Borrower hereunder (collectively, Borrower 
Materials) by posting the Borrower Materials on IntraLinks or another 
similar electronic system (the Platform), and (b) certain of the Lenders 
may be public-side Lenders (i.e., Lenders that do not wish to receive 
material non-public information with respect to Holdings, the Borrower or 
its Subsidiaries or any of their respective securities) (each, a Public 
Lender). The Borrower hereby agrees that it will use commercially 
reasonable efforts to identify that portion of the Borrower Materials that 
may be distributed to the Public Lenders and that (i) all such Borrower 
Materials shall be clearly and conspicuously marked PUBLIC which, at a 
minimum, shall mean that the word PUBLIC shall appear prominently on the 
first page thereof, (ii) by marking Borrower Materials PUBLIC, the 
Borrower shall be deemed to have authorized the Administrative Agent, the 
Arrangers, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders to treat such Borrower 
Materials as solely containing information that is either (A) publicly 
available information or (B) not material (although it may be sensitive and 
proprietary) with respect to Holdings, the Borrower or its Subsidiaries or 
any of their respective securities for purposes of United States Federal 
and state securities laws (provided, however, that such Borrower Materials 
shall be treated as set forth in Section 9.16, to the extent such Borrower 
Materials constitute information subject to the terms thereof), (iii) all 
Borrower Materials marked PUBLIC are permitted to be made available 
through a portion of the Platform designated Public Investor; and (iv) 
the Administrative Agent and the Arrangers shall be entitled to treat any 
Borrower Materials that are not marked PUBLIC as being suitable only for 
posting on a portion of the Platform not designated Public Investor.

Section 9.18 Release of Liens and Guarantees.

(a) The Lenders, the Issuing Banks and other Secured Parties hereby 
irrevocably agree that the Liens granted to the Collateral Agent by the 
Loan Parties on any Collateral shall be automatically released: (i) in full 
upon the occurrence of the Termination Date as set forth in Section 9.18(d) 
below; (ii) upon the Disposition of such Collateral by any Loan Party to a 
person that is not (and is not required to become) a Loan Party in a 
transaction not prohibited by this Agreement (and the Collateral Agent may 
rely conclusively on a certificate to that effect provided to it by any 
Loan Party upon its reasonable request without further inquiry), (iii) to 
the extent that such Collateral comprises property leased to a Loan Party 
by a person that is not a Loan Party, upon termination or expiration of 
such lease (and the Collateral Agent may rely conclusively on a certificate 
to that effect provided to it by any Loan Party upon its reasonable request 
without further inquiry), (iv) if the release of such Lien is approved, 
authorized or ratified in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other 
percentage of the Lenders whose consent may be required in accordance with 
Section 9.08), (v) to the extent that the property constituting such 
Collateral is owned by any Guarantor, upon the release of such Guarantor 
from its obligations under the Guarantee in accordance with the Holdings 
Guarantee
 
189

------------------------------------------------------------------------
and Pledge Agreement or the Subsidiary Guarantee, as applicable, or clause 
(b) below (and the Collateral Agent may rely conclusively on a certificate 
to that effect provided to it by any Loan Party upon its reasonable request 
without further inquiry), (vi) as provided in Section 8.11 (and the 
Collateral Agent may rely conclusively on a certificate to that effect 
provided to it by any Loan Party upon its reasonable request without 
further inquiry), and (vii) as required by the Collateral Agent to effect 
any Disposition of Collateral in connection with any exercise of remedies 
of the Collateral Agent pursuant to the Security Documents. Any such 
release shall not in any manner discharge, affect, or impair the 
Obligations or any Liens (other than those being released) upon (or 
obligations (other than those being released) of the Loan Parties in 
respect of) all interests retained by the Loan Parties, including the 
proceeds of any Disposition, all of which shall continue to constitute part 
of the Collateral except to the extent otherwise released in accordance 
with the provisions of the Loan Documents.

(b) In addition, (i) the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and other Secured 
Parties hereby irrevocably agree that the Subsidiary Loan Parties shall be 
released from the Guarantees upon consummation of any transaction not 
prohibited hereunder resulting in such Subsidiary ceasing to constitute a 
Subsidiary Loan Party or otherwise becoming an Excluded Subsidiary (and the 
Collateral Agent may rely conclusively on a certificate to that effect 
provided to it by any Loan Party upon its reasonable request without 
further inquiry) and (ii) immediately prior to the consummation of a 
Qualified IPO, the Guarantee incurred by Holdings of the Obligations shall 
automatically terminate and Holdings shall be released from its obligations 
under the Loan Documents, shall cease to be a Loan Party and any Liens 
created by any Loan Documents on any assets or Equity Interests owned by 
Holdings shall automatically be released (unless the Borrower shall elect 
in its sole discretion that such release of Holdings shall not be 
effected).

(c) The Lenders, the Issuing Banks and other Secured Parties hereby 
authorize the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent, as applicable, 
to execute and deliver any instruments, documents, and agreements necessary 
or desirable to evidence and confirm the release of any Guarantor or 
Collateral pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 9.18, all 
without the further consent or joinder of any Lender. Upon release pursuant 
to this Section 9.18, any representation, warranty or covenant contained in 
any Loan Document relating to any such Collateral or Guarantor shall no 
longer be deemed to be made. In connection with any release hereunder, the 
Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent shall promptly (and the 
Secured Parties hereby authorize the Administrative Agent and the 
Collateral Agent to) take such action and execute any such documents as may 
be reasonably requested by the Borrower and at the Borrowers expense in 
connection with the release of any Liens created by any Loan Document in 
respect of such Subsidiary, property or asset; provided, that the 
Administrative Agent shall have received a certificate of a Responsible 
Officer of the Borrower containing such certifications as the 
Administrative Agent shall reasonably request.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or any other 
Loan Document, on the Termination Date, upon request of the Borrower, the 
Administrative Agent and/or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, shall 
(without notice to, or vote or consent of, any Secured Party) take such 
actions as shall be required to release its security interest in all 
Collateral, and to release all obligations under any Loan Document, whether 
or not
 
190

------------------------------------------------------------------------
on the date of such release there may be any (i) obligations in respect of 
any Secured Hedge Agreements or any Secured Cash Management Agreements and 
(ii) any contingent indemnification obligations or expense reimburse claims 
not then due; provided, that the Administrative Agent shall have received a 
certificate of a Responsible Officer of the Borrower containing such 
certifications as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably request. Any 
such release of obligations shall be deemed subject to the provision that 
such obligations shall be reinstated if after such release any portion of 
any payment in respect of the obligations guaranteed thereby shall be 
rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned upon the insolvency, 
bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or reorganization of the Borrower or 
any Guarantor, or upon or as a result of the appointment of a receiver, 
intervenor or conservator of, or trustee or similar officer for, the 
Borrower or any Guarantor or any substantial part of its property, or 
otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made. The Borrower 
agrees to pay all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred 
by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent (and their respective 
representatives) in connection with taking such actions to release security 
interest in all Collateral and all obligations under the Loan Documents as 
contemplated by this Section 9.18(d).

(e) Obligations of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries under any 
Secured Cash Management Agreement or Secured Hedge Agreement (after giving 
effect to all netting arrangements relating to such Secured Hedge 
Agreements) shall be secured and guaranteed pursuant to the Security 
Documents only to the extent that, and for so long as, the other 
Obligations are so secured and guaranteed. No person shall have any voting 
rights under any Loan Document solely as a result of the existence of 
obligations owed to it under any such Secured Hedge Agreement or Secured 
Cash Management Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, no release of 
Collateral or Guarantors effected in the manner permitted by this Agreement 
shall require the consent of any holder of obligations under Secured Hedge 
Agreements or any Secured Cash Management Agreements.

Section 9.19 Judgment Currency. If, for the purposes of obtaining judgment 
in any court, it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder or any other 
Loan Document in one currency into another currency, the rate of exchange 
used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures 
the Administrative Agent could purchase the first currency with such other 
currency on the Business Day preceding that on which final judgment is 
given. The obligation of the Borrower in respect of any such sum due from 
it to the Administrative Agent or the Lenders hereunder or under the other 
Loan Documents shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency (the 
Judgment Currency) other than that in which such sum is denominated in 
accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement (the 
Agreement Currency), be discharged only to the extent that on the Business 
Day following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any sum adjudged to be 
so due in the Judgment Currency, the Administrative Agent may in accordance 
with normal banking procedures purchase the Agreement Currency with the 
Judgment Currency. If the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is 
less than the sum originally due to the Administrative Agent from the 
Borrower in the Agreement Currency, the Borrower agrees, as a separate 
obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify the 
Administrative Agent or the person to whom such obligation was owing 
against such loss. If the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is 
greater than the sum originally due to the Administrative Agent in such 
currency, the Administrative Agent agrees to return the amount of any 
excess to the Borrower (or to any other person who may be entitled thereto 
under applicable law).
 
191

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Section 9.20 USA PATRIOT Act Notice. Each Lender that is subject to the USA 
PATRIOT Act and the Administrative Agent (for itself and not on behalf of 
any Lender) hereby notifies the Borrower that pursuant to the requirements 
of the USA PATRIOT Act, it is required to obtain, verify and record

Loan Party in accordance with the USA PATRIOT Act.

Section 9.21 Affiliate Lenders.

(a) Each Lender who is an Affiliate of the Borrower, excluding (x) 
Holdings, the Borrower and their respective Subsidiaries and (y) any Debt 
Fund Affiliate Lender (each, an Affiliate Lender; it being understood 
that (x) neither Holdings, the Borrower, nor any of their Subsidiaries may 
be Affiliate Lenders and (y) Debt Fund Affiliate Lenders and Affiliate 
Lenders may be Lenders hereunder in accordance with Section 9.04, subject 
in the case of Affiliate Lenders, to this Section 9.21), in connection with 
any (i) consent (or decision not to consent) to any amendment, 
modification, waiver, consent or other action with respect to any of the 
terms of any Loan Document, (ii) other action on any matter related to any 
Loan Document or (iii) direction to the Administrative Agent, the 
Collateral Agent or any Lender to undertake any action (or refrain from 
taking any action) with respect to or under any Loan Document, agrees that, 
except with respect to any amendment, modification, waiver, consent or 
other action (1) described in clauses (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) of the first 
proviso of Section 9.08(b) or (2) that affects such Affiliate Lender (in 
its capacity as a Lender) in a disproportionately adverse manner as 
compared to other Lenders, such Affiliate Lender shall be deemed to have 
voted its interest as a Lender without discretion in such proportion as the 
allocation of voting with respect to such matter by Lenders who are not 
Affiliate Lenders. Each Affiliate Lender hereby irrevocably appoints the 
Administrative Agent (such appointment being coupled with an interest) as 
such Affiliate Lenders attorney-in-fact, with full authority in the place 
and stead of such Affiliate Lender and in the name of such Affiliate 
Lender, from time to time in the Administrative Agents discretion to take 
any action and to execute any instrument that the Administrative Agent may 
deem reasonably necessary to carry out the provisions of this clause (a).

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no 
Affiliate Lender shall have any right to (a) attend (including by 
telephone) any meeting or discussions (or portion thereof) among the 
Administrative Agent or any Lender to which representatives of the Borrower 
are not then present, (b) receive any information or material prepared by 
Administrative Agent or any Lender or any communication by or among 
Administrative Agent and/or one or more Lenders, except to the extent such 
information or materials have been made available to the Borrower or its 
representatives, (c) make or bring (or participate in, other than as a 
passive participant in or recipient of its pro rata benefits of) any claim, 
in its capacity as a Lender, against Administrative Agent, the Collateral 
Agent or any other Lender with respect to any duties or obligations or 
alleged duties or obligations of such Agent or any other such Lender under 
the Loan Documents, (d) purchase any Term Loan if, after giving effect to 
such purchase, Affiliate Lenders in the aggregate would own Term Loans with 
an aggregate principal amount in excess of 25% of the aggregate principal 
amount of all Term Loans then outstanding or (e) purchase any Revolving 
Facility Loans or Revolving Facility Commitments.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Section 9.22 Agency of the Borrower for the Loan Parties.

Each of the other Loan Parties hereby appoints the Borrower as its agent 
for all purposes relevant to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, 
including the giving and receipt of notices and the execution and delivery 
of all documents, instruments and certificates contemplated herein and 
therein and all modifications hereto and thereto.

Section 9.23 No Liability of the Issuing Banks. The Borrower assumes all 
risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee of any 
Letter of Credit with respect to its use of such Letter of Credit. Neither 
any Issuing Bank nor any of its officers or directors shall be liable or 
responsible for: (a) the use that may be made of any Letter of Credit or 
any acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee in connection 
therewith; (b) the validity, sufficiency or genuineness of documents, or of 
any endorsement thereon, even if such documents should prove to be in any 
or all respects invalid, insufficient, fraudulent or forged; (c) payment by 
such Issuing Bank against presentation of documents that do not comply with 
the terms of a Letter of Credit, including failure of any documents to bear 
any reference or adequate reference to the Letter of Credit; or (d) any 
other circumstances whatsoever in making or failing to make payment under 
any Letter of Credit, except that the Borrower shall have a claim against 
such Issuing Bank, and such Issuing Bank shall be liable to the Borrower, 
to the extent of any direct, but not consequential, damages suffered by the 
Borrower that the Borrower proves were caused by (i) such Issuing Banks 
willful misconduct or gross negligence as determined in a final, 
non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction in determining 
whether documents presented under any Letter of Credit comply with the 
terms of the Letter of Credit or (ii) such Issuing Banks willful failure 
to make lawful payment under a Letter of Credit after the presentation to 
it of a draft and certificates strictly complying with the terms and 
conditions of the Letter of Credit. In furtherance and not in limitation of 
the foregoing, such Issuing Bank may accept documents that appear on their 
face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, 
regardless of any notice or information to the contrary.

Section 9.24 Application of Gaming Laws.

(a) This Agreement and the other Loan Documents are subject to Gaming Laws. 
Without limiting the foregoing and notwithstanding anything herein or in 
any other Loan Document to the contrary, the Lenders, Agents and Secured 
Parties acknowledge that (i) they are subject to the jurisdiction of the 
Gaming Authorities, in their discretion, for licensing, qualification or 
findings of suitability or to file or provide other information, and (ii) 
all rights, remedies and powers in or under this Agreement and the other 
Loan Documents, including with respect to the Collateral (including the 
pledge and delivery of the Pledged Collateral (as defined in the applicable 
Security Documents)), any Mortgaged Property and the ownership and 
operation of facilities, are, in each case, subject to the jurisdiction of 
the Gaming Authorities, and may be exercised only to the extent that the 
exercise thereof does not violate any applicable provisions of the Gaming 
Laws and only to the extent that required approvals (including prior 
approvals) are obtained from the relevant Gaming Authorities.
 
193

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(b) The Lenders, Agents and Secured Parties agree to cooperate with all 
Gaming Authorities in connection with the provision in a timely manner of 
such documents or other information as may be requested by such Gaming 
Authorities relating to the Loan or Loan Documents.

(c) The Lenders acknowledge and agree that if the Borrower receives a 
notice from any applicable Gaming Authority that any Lender is a 
Disqualified holder (and such Lender is notified by the Borrower in writing 
of such Disqualification), the Borrower shall, following any available 
appeal of such determination by such Gaming Authority (unless the rules of 
the applicable Gaming Authority do not permit such Lender to retain its 
Loans or Commitments pending appeal of such determination), have the right 
to (i) cause such Disqualified holder to transfer and assign, without 
recourse all of its interests, rights and obligations in its Loans and 
Commitments or (ii) in the event that (A) the Borrower is unable to assign 
such Loan or Commitments after using its best efforts to cause such an 
assignment and (B) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is 
continuing, prepay such Disqualified holders Loan and terminate such 
Disqualified holders Commitments, as applicable. Notice to such 
Disqualified holder shall be given ten days prior to the required date of 
assignment or prepayment, as the case may be, and shall be accompanied by 
evidence demonstrating that such transfer or prepayment is required 
pursuant to Gaming Laws. If reasonably requested by any Disqualified 
holder, the Borrower will use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate 
with any such holder that is seeking to appeal such determination and to 
afford such holder an opportunity to participate in any proceedings 
relating thereto. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any 
prepayment of a Loan shall be at a price that, unless otherwise directed by 
a Gaming Authority, shall be equal to the sum of the principal amount of 
such Loan and interest to the date on which such Lender or holder became a 
Disqualified holder (plus any fees and other amounts accrued for the 
account of such Disqualified holder to the date such Lender or holder 
became a Disqualified holder).

(d) If during the existence of an Event of Default hereunder or any of the 
other Loan Documents, it shall become necessary or, in the opinion of the 
Administrative Agent, advisable for an agent, supervisor, receiver or other 
representative of the Lenders to become licensed or found qualified under 
any Gaming Law as a condition to receiving the benefit of any Collateral 
encumbered by the Loan Documents or to otherwise enforce the rights of the 
Agents, Secured Parties and the Lenders under the Loan Documents, the 
Borrower hereby agrees to consent to the application for such license or 
qualification and to execute such further documents as may be required in 
connection with the evidencing of such consent.

SOLVENCY CERTIFICATE

[], 201[]

This Solvency Certificate is delivered pursuant to Section 4.02(i) of the 
First Lien Credit Agreement, dated as of December 20, 2013 (as the same may 
be amended, restated, or otherwise modified from time to time, the Credit 
Agreement), among AP Gaming Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability 
company, AP Gaming I, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the 
Borrower), the lenders party thereto from time to time (the Lenders) and 
Citicorp North America, Inc., as Administrative Agent. Capitalized terms 
used herein and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings 
assigned to such terms in the Credit Agreement.

The undersigned hereby certifies, solely in [his][her] capacity as an 
Authorized Signatory of the Borrower and not in [his][her] individual 
capacity, as follows:

1. I am a Financial Officer of the Borrower. I am familiar with the 
Transactions, and have reviewed the Credit Agreement, financial statements 
referred to in Section 3.05 of the Credit Agreement and such documents and 
made such investigation as I have deemed relevant for the purposes of this 
Solvency Certificate.

2. As of the date hereof, immediately after giving effect to the 
consummation of the Transactions, on and as of such date (i) the fair value 
of the assets of the Borrower and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, 
at a fair valuation, exceeds the debts and liabilities, direct, 
subordinated, contingent or otherwise, of the Borrower and its subsidiaries 
on a consolidated basis; (ii) the present fair saleable value of the 
property of the Borrower and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis is 
greater than the amount that will be required to pay the probable liability 
of the Borrower and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis on their debts 
and other liabilities, direct, subordinated, contingent or otherwise, as 
such debts and other liabilities become absolute and matured; (iii) the 
Borrower and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis are able to pay their 
debts and liabilities, direct, subordinated, contingent or otherwise, as 
such debts and liabilities become absolute and matured; and (iv) the 
Borrower and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis do not have 
unreasonably small capital with which to conduct the businesses in which 
they are engaged as such businesses are now conducted and are proposed to 
be conducted following the Closing Date.

3. As of the date hereof, immediately after giving effect to the 
consummation of the Transactions, the Borrower does not intend to, and the 
Borrower does not believe that it or any of its subsidiaries will, incur 
debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature, taking into 
account the timing and amounts of cash to be received by it or any such 
subsidiary and the timing and amounts of cash to be payable on or in 
respect of its debts or the debts of any such subsidiary.

This Solvency Certificate is being delivered by the undersigned Authorized 
Signatory only in [his][her] capacity as a Financial Officer of the 
Borrower and not individually and the undersigned shall have no personal 
liability to the Administrative Agent or the Lenders with respect thereto.

FORM OF GLOBAL INTERCOMPANY NOTE

[], 201[]

FOR VALUE RECEIVED, each of the undersigned, to the extent a borrower from 
time to time from any other entity listed on the signature pages hereto 
(each, in such capacity, an Issuer), hereby promises to pay on demand to 
the order of such other entity listed below (each, in such capacity as 
lender to the applicable Issuer, a Holder and, together with each Issuer, 
a Note Party), in immediately available funds in the currencies as shall 
be agreed upon from time to time, at such location as the applicable Holder 
shall from time to time designate, the unpaid principal amount of all loans 
and advances or other credit extensions made by such Holder to such Issuer. 
Each Issuer promises also to pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of 
all such loans and advances or other credit extensions in like money at 
said location from the date of such loans and advances until paid at such 
rate per annum as shall be agreed upon from time to time by such Issuer and 
such Holder.

With respect to any Issuer and any Holder between whom loans, advances or 
other credit extensions exist as of the date of this intercompany 
promissory note (this Note) (such loans, advances or other credit 
extensions, Existing Obligations), (a) if any Existing Obligation is 
evidenced by a promissory note or other instrument or agreement in 
existence as of the date hereof (an Existing Note), it is agreed to 
between such Issuer and such Holder that the obligations under such 
Existing Note are hereafter to be evidenced by this Note and (b) it is 
agreed to between such Issuer and such Holder that the agreements in 
existence as of the date hereof with respect to any Existing Obligation 
(including agreements contained in any Existing Note) as to principal, 
amortization, currency, payment location and interest rate (if any) will 
continue to have effect under this Note until modified by agreement between 
such Issuer and such Holder.

Reference is hereby made to the First Lien Credit Agreement, dated as of 
December 20, 2013 (as amended, amended and restated, supplemented or 
otherwise modified from time to time, the Credit Agreement), among AP 
Gaming Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, AP Gaming I, 
LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the Borrower), the lenders 
party thereto from time to time (collectively, the Lenders and 
individually, a Lender), Citicorp North America, Inc., as administrative 
agent (in such capacity, the Agent). Capitalized terms used herein and 
not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to such terms 
in the Credit Agreement.

Anything in this Note to the contrary notwithstanding, the indebtedness 
evidenced by this Note owed by any Issuer that is the Borrower or a 
Subsidiary Loan Party to any Holder that is not a Loan Party shall be 
subordinate and junior in right of payment, to the extent and in the manner 
hereinafter set forth, to (i) all Obligations of the Borrower or such 
Issuer under the Credit Agreement and (ii) all other Indebtedness of such 
Issuer or any guaranty thereof other than Indebtedness that by its terms 
expressly provides that it shall not be Senior Indebtedness hereunder (such 
Obligations and such Indebtedness and other indebtedness and obligations in 
connection with any renewal, refunding, restructuring or refinancing 
thereof, including interest

------------------------------------------------------------------------
thereon accruing after the commencement of any proceedings referred to in 
clause (i) below, whether or not such interest is an allowed claim in such 
proceeding, being hereinafter collectively referred to as Senior 
Indebtedness):

(i) In the event of any insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings, and any 
receivership, liquidation, reorganization or other similar proceedings in 
connection therewith, relative to any Issuer or to its creditors, as such, 
or to its property, and in the event of any proceedings for voluntary 
liquidation, dissolution or other winding up of such Issuer, whether or not 
involving insolvency or bankruptcy, then, if a Default has occurred and is 
continuing, (x) the holders of Senior Indebtedness shall be paid in full in 
cash in respect of all amounts constituting Senior Indebtedness before any 
Holder is entitled to receive (whether directly or indirectly), or make any 
demands for, any payment on account of this Note and (y) until the holders 
of Senior Indebtedness are paid in full in cash in respect of all amounts 
constituting Senior Indebtedness, any payment or distribution to which such 
Holder would otherwise be entitled (other than debt securities of such 
Issuer that are subordinated, to at least the same extent as this Note, to 
the payment of all Senior Indebtedness then outstanding (such securities 
being hereinafter referred to as Restructured Debt Securities)) shall be 
made to the holders of Senior Indebtedness;

(ii) if any Event of Default has occurred and is continuing with respect to 
any Senior Indebtedness (including any Default under the Credit Agreement), 
then no payment or distribution of any kind or character shall be made by 
or on behalf of any Issuer or any other Person on its behalf with respect 
to this Note; and

(iii) if any payment or distribution of any character, whether in cash, 
securities or other property (other than Restructured Debt Securities), in 
respect of this Note shall (despite these subordination provisions) be 
received by any Holder in violation of clause (i) or (ii) before all Senior 
Indebtedness shall have been paid in full in cash, such payment or 
distribution shall be held in trust for the benefit of, and shall be paid 
over or delivered to, the holders of Senior Indebtedness (or their 
representatives), ratably according to the respective aggregate amounts 
remaining unpaid thereon, to the extent necessary to pay all Senior 
Indebtedness in full in cash.

To the fullest extent permitted by law, no present or future holder of 
Senior Indebtedness shall be prejudiced in its right to enforce the 
subordination of this Note by any act or failure to act on the part of any 
Issuer or by any act or failure to act on the part of such holder or any 
trustee or agent for such holder. Each Holder and each Issuer hereby agree 
that the subordination of this Note is for the benefit of the Agent and the 
Lenders and the Agent and the Lenders are obligees under this Note to the 
same extent as if their names were written herein as such and the Agent 
may, on behalf of itself and the Lenders, proceed to enforce the 
subordination provisions herein.

The indebtedness evidenced by this Note owed by any Issuer that is not the 
Borrower or a Subsidiary Loan Party shall not be subordinated to, and shall 
rank pari passu in right of payment with, any other obligation of such 
Issuer.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in the subordination 
provisions set forth above is intended to or will impair, as between each 
Issuer and each Holder, the obligations of such Issuer, which are absolute 
and unconditional, to pay to such Holder the principal of and interest on 
this Note as and when due and payable in accordance with its terms, or is 
intended to or will affect the relative rights of such Holder and other 
creditors of such Issuer other than the holders of Senior Indebtedness.

Each Holder is hereby authorized to record all loans and advances or other 
credit extensions made by it to any Issuer (all of which shall be evidenced 
by this Note), and all repayments or prepayments thereof, in its books and 
records, such books and records constituting prima facie evidence of the 
accuracy of the information contained therein. For the avoidance of doubt, 
this Note as between each Issuer and each Holder contains additional terms 
to any intercompany loan agreement between them and this Note does not in 
any way replace such intercompany loans between them nor does this Note in 
any way change the principal amount of any intercompany loans between them.

Upon execution and delivery after the date hereof by the Borrower or any 
subsidiary of the Borrower of a counterpart signature page hereto, such 
subsidiary shall become a Note Party hereunder with the same force and 
effect as if originally named as a Note Party hereunder. The rights and 
obligations of each Note Party hereunder shall remain in full force and 
effect notwithstanding the addition of any new Note Party as a party to 
this Note.

Each Issuer hereby waives presentment, demand, protest or notice of any 
kind in connection with this Note. All payments under this Note shall be 
made without offset, counterclaim or deduction of any kind.

THIS NOTE SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS 
OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.
