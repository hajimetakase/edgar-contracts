this Agreement.
 
Acquisition Consideration means the purchase consideration for any 
Permitted Acquisition and all other payments by the Parent or any of its 
Subsidiaries in exchange for, or as part of any Permitted Acquisition, 
whether paid in cash or by exchange of Equity Interests or of properties or 
otherwise (including by incurrence of Indebtedness, whether or not in favor 
of any seller or affiliate of any seller) and whether payable at or prior 
to the consummation of such Permitted Acquisition or deferred for payment 
at any future time, whether or not any such future payment is subject to

representing the purchase price and any assumptions of Indebtedness, 
earn-outs and other agreements to make any payment, whether or not the 
amount thereof is, or the terms of payment of which are, in any respect 
subject to or contingent upon the revenues, income, cash flow or profits 
(or the like) of any person or business, but excluding transaction-related 
fees and expenses; and any such future payment shall be considered 
Acquisition Consideration at 100% of the maximum amount thereof if such 
amount is not contingent, or, if such amount is contingent, the amount 
reasonably estimated in good faith by the Parent on the basis of 
assumptions and calculations provided in writing to the Administrative 
Agent.  Such
 
2
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
assumptions shall include reasonable projections of any measure of 
financial or other performance that enters into the calculation of the 
amount of any such payment or other consideration but shall not include any 
assumption that any other future event that is a condition to such payment 
or consideration (such as the later disposition of the acquired business or 
a public or private offering of securities) will not occur.  Any such 
amounts payable after the 12-month period following the closing of the 
acquisition shall be calculated on a net present value basis discounted at 
the then current U.S. Treasury rate with a maturity substantially the same 
as the final payment date thereunder.
 
Additional Lender has the meaning specified in Section 2.14(c).
 
Adjusted Eurodollar Rate means, with respect to any Eurodollar Borrowing 
for any Interest Period, an interest rate per annum equal to the Eurodollar

paragraph to this Agreement.

that OID and upfront or commitment fees paid to lenders shall be equated to 
interest rate assuming a 4-year life to maturity (or, if less, the stated 
life to maturity at the time of its incurrence of the applicable 
Indebtedness); and provided, further, that All-In Yield shall not include 
arrangement fees, structuring fees or underwriting or similar fees paid 
solely to arrangers for or underwriters of such Indebtedness.
 
Annual Financial Statements means the audited consolidated balance sheet 
of the Parent as of June 30, 2013, and the related consolidated statements

(a)                                 Term Loans.  Subject to the terms and 
conditions set forth herein, each Term Lender severally agrees to make to 
3D Material a single Term Loan denominated in Dollars equal to such 
Lenders Term Loan Commitment on the Closing Date.  Amounts borrowed under 
this Section 2.01(a) and repaid or prepaid may not be reborrowed.  Term 
Loans may be Base Rate Loans or Eurodollar Rate Loans, as further provided 
herein.
 
(b)                                 Revolving Loans.  Subject to the terms 
and conditions set forth herein, each Revolving Lender severally agrees to 
make to the Borrowers Revolving Loans denominated in Dollars in an 
aggregate principal amount that will not result in (i) such Lenders 
Revolving Exposure exceeding such Lenders Revolving Commitment or (ii) the 
Aggregate Revolving Exposure exceeding the sum of the aggregate Revolving 
Commitments, at any time and from
 
44
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
time to time during the Availability Period for the Revolving Facility.  
Amounts borrowed under this Section 2.01(b) and repaid or prepaid may be 
reborrowed, on the terms and subject to the conditions herein.  Revolving 
Loans may be Base Rate Loans or Eurodollar Rate Loans, as further provided 
herein.
 
(c)                                  Delayed Draw Term Loans.  Subject to 
the terms and conditions set forth herein, each Delayed Draw Term Lender 
severally agrees to make to the Borrowers Delayed Draw Term Loans 
denominated in Dollars in an aggregate principal amount that will not 
result in the aggregate principal amount at such time of all outstanding 
Delayed Draw Term Loans exceeding the aggregate Delayed Draw Term Loan 
Commitment, at any time on a date after the Closing Date but prior to end 
of the Availability Period for the Delayed Draw Term Facility.  Any 
Borrowing of a Delayed Draw Term Loan will automatically and permanently 
reduce the Delayed Draw Term Loan Commitment in an amount corresponding to 
the amount of such Borrowing.  Amounts borrowed under this Section 2.01(c) 
and repaid or prepaid may not be reborrowed.  Delayed Draw Term Loans may 
be Base Rate Loans or Eurodollar Rate Loans, as further provided herein.
 
Section 2.02.                          Borrowings, Conversions and 
Continuations of Loans.
 
(a)                                 Each Borrowing, each conversion of 
Loans from one Type to the other, and each continuation of Eurodollar Rate 
Loans shall be made upon the Parents irrevocable notice to the 
Administrative Agent.  Each such notice must be received by the 
Administrative Agent not later than 1:00 p.m. (i) three (3) Business Days 
prior to the requested date of any Borrowing or continuation of Eurodollar 
Rate Loans or any conversion of Base Rate Loans to Eurodollar Rate Loans, 
and (ii) on or before 12:00 noon on the requested date of any Borrowing of 
Base Rate Loan.  Each Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of 
Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of $500,000 or a whole 
multiple of $250,000 in excess thereof.  Each Borrowing of or conversion to 
Base Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of $250,000 or a whole 
multiple of $50,000 in excess thereof.  Each Loan Notice shall specify (i) 
whether the Parent is requesting a Borrowing, a conversion of Loans from 
one Type to the other, or a continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans, (ii) the 
requested date of the Borrowing, conversion or continuation, as the case 
may be (which shall be a Business Day), (iii) the principal amount of Loans 
to be borrowed, converted or continued, (iv) the Class and Type of Loans to 
be borrowed or the Type of Loans to which existing Loans are to be 
converted, (v) if applicable, the duration of the Interest Period with 
respect thereto, and (vi) if the Borrowing is a Borrowing of Revolving 
Loans or Delayed Draw Term Loans, the Borrower to whom such Loan is being 
made.  If the Parent fails to specify a Type of Loan in a Loan Notice, then 
the applicable Loans shall be made as Base Rate Loans.  If the Parent 
requests a Borrowing of, conversion to, or continuation of Eurodollar Rate 
Loans in any such Loan Notice, but fails to specify an Interest Period (or 
the Parent fails to timely deliver a notice of conversion or continuation 
prior to the expiration of an Interest Period), it will be deemed to have 
specified an Interest Period of one (1) month.  Any Swingline Loans shall 
be made in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.12.
 
(b)                                 Following receipt of a Loan Notice, the 
Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the amount of its 
Pro Rata Share of the applicable Class of Loans, and if no timely notice of 
a conversion or continuation is provided by the Parent, the Administrative 
Agent shall notify each Lender of the details of any automatic conversion 
to Base Rate Loans or
 
45
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
continuation of Loans described in Section 2.02(a).  In the case of each 
Borrowing, each Appropriate Lender shall make the amount of its Loan 
available to the Administrative Agent in Same Day Funds at the 
Administrative Agents Office not later than 1:00 p.m., on the Business Day 
specified in the applicable Loan Notice.  Upon satisfaction of the 
applicable conditions set forth in Section 4.02 (and, if such Borrowing is 
on the Closing Date, Section 4.01), the Administrative Agent shall make all 
funds so received available to the applicable Borrower in like funds as 
received by the Administrative Agent either by (i) crediting the account of 
the applicable Borrower on the books of the Administrative Agent with the 
amount of such funds or (ii) wire transfer of such funds, in each case in 
accordance with instructions provided to (and reasonably acceptable to) the 
Administrative Agent by the Parent.
 
(c)                                  Except as otherwise provided herein, a 
Eurodollar Rate Loan may be continued or converted only on the last day of 
an Interest Period for such Eurodollar Rate Loan.  Upon the occurrence and 
during the continuation of an Event of Default, the Administrative Agent or 
the Required Lenders may require by notice to the Parent that no Loans may 
be converted to or continued as Eurodollar Rate Loans.
 
(d)                                 The Administrative Agent shall promptly 
notify the Parent and the Lenders of the interest rate applicable to any 
Interest Period for Eurodollar Rate Loans upon determination of such 
interest rate.  The determination of the Eurodollar Rate by the 
Administrative Agent shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest or 
demonstrable error.  At any time when Base Rate Loans are outstanding, the 
Administrative Agent shall notify the Parent and the Lenders of any change 
in the Administrative Agents prime rate used in determining the Base Rate 
promptly following the public announcement of such change.
 
(e)                                  After giving effect to all Borrowings, 
all conversions of Loans from one Type to the other, and all continuations 
of Loans as the same Type, there shall not be more than six (6) Interest 
Periods in effect unless otherwise agreed between the Parent and the 
Administrative Agent.
 
(f)                                   The failure of any Lender to make the 
Loan to be made by it as part of any Borrowing shall not relieve any other 
Lender of its obligation, if any, hereunder to make its Loan on the date of 
such Borrowing, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any 
other Lender to make the Loan to be made by such other Lender on the date 
of any Borrowing.
 
(g)                                  Unless the Administrative Agent shall 
have received notice from a Lender prior to the date of any Borrowing that 
such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such 
Lenders Pro Rata Share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may 
assume that such Lender has made such Pro Rata Share available to the 
Administrative Agent on the date of such Borrowing in accordance with 
paragraph (b) above, and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon 
such assumption, make available to the applicable Borrower on such date a 
corresponding amount.  If the Administrative Agent shall have so made funds 
available, then, to the extent that such Lender shall not have made such 
portion available to the Administrative Agent, each of such Lender and the 
applicable Borrower severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent 
forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together with interest 
thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to such 
Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent 
at (i) in the case of a Borrower, the
 
46
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
interest rate applicable at the time to the Loans comprising such Borrowing 
and (ii) in the case of such Lender, the Overnight Rate plus any 
administrative, processing, or similar fees customarily charged by the 
Administrative Agent in accordance with the foregoing.  A certificate of 
the Administrative Agent submitted to any Lender with respect to any 
amounts owing under this Section 2.02(g) shall be conclusive in the absence 
of manifest or demonstrable error.  If such Lender pays its share of the 
applicable Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid 
shall constitute such Lenders Loan included in such Borrowing.  Any 
payment by a Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrowers 
may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to 
the Administrative Agent.
 
Section 2.03.                          Prepayments.
 
(a)                                 Optional.

    time voluntarily prepay Loans in whole or in part without premium or
    penalty; provided that (1) such notice must be received by the
    Administrative Agent not later than 1:00 pm (New York, New York time)
    (A) three (3) Business Days prior to any date of prepayment of
    Eurodollar Rate Loans and (B) on the date of prepayment of Base Rate
    Loans; (2) any partial prepayment of Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be in
    a principal amount of $500,000 or a whole multiple of $250,000 in
    excess thereof or, if less, the entire principal amount thereof then
    outstanding; and (3) any prepayment of Base Rate Loans shall be in a
    principal amount of $250,000 or a whole multiple of $50,000 in excess
    thereof or, if less, the entire principal amount thereof then
    outstanding.  Each such notice shall specify the date and amount of
    such prepayment and the Class(es) and Type(s) of Loans to be prepaid
    and the payment amount specified in such notice shall be due and
    payable on the date specified therein.  The Administrative Agent will
    promptly notify each Appropriate Lender of its receipt of each such
    notice, and of the amount of such Lenders Pro Rata Share of such
    prepayment.  Any prepayment of a Eurodollar Rate Loan shall be
    accompanied by all accrued interest thereon, together with any
    additional amounts required pursuant to Section 3.05.  Each prepayment
    of the Loans pursuant to this Section 2.03(a) shall be paid to the
    Appropriate Lenders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata
    Shares.
     
    (ii)                                  Notwithstanding anything to the
    contrary contained in this subsection (a), the Parent may rescind any
    notice of prepayment under Section 2.03(a)(i) if such prepayment would
    have resulted from a refinancing of all of the applicable Credit
    Facility or other transaction, which refinancing or transaction shall
    not be consummated or shall otherwise be delayed.
     
    (iii)                               Voluntary prepayments of any Term
    Loans permitted hereunder shall be applied as directed by the Parent. 
    Voluntary prepayments of outstanding Revolving Loans shall be applied
    pro rata to the outstanding Revolving Loans and shall not result in a
    permanent reduction in the Revolving Commitments.

    (i)                                     If the Aggregate Revolving
    Exposure outstanding exceeds the Revolving Commitment, the Borrowers
    will immediately prepay the Revolving Loans hereunder without any
    prepayment premium or penalty (but subject to the payment of all
    amounts for which the Borrowers are liable under Section 3.05 or

    Delayed Draw Term Loans hereunder without any prepayment premium or
    penalty (but subject to the payment of all amounts for which the
    Borrowers are liable under Section 3.05 or similar costs) to the extent

    date of any Asset Sale by the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, the
    Borrowers will prepay the Loans hereunder in an aggregate amount equal
    to 100% of the amount of Net Cash Proceeds from such Asset Sale

    (iv)                              On the fifth Business Day after any
    incurrence of Indebtedness by the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
    (including the incurrence of the Indebtedness evidenced by the
    Subordinated Debt but other than other Indebtedness expressly permitted
    pursuant to Section 7.03), the Borrowers will prepay the Loans
    hereunder in an aggregate amount equal to 100% of the amount of the Net
    Cash Proceeds from such incurrence of Indebtedness received by the
    Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.
     
    (v)                                 On the fifth Business Day after the
    closing of any offering or sale of Equity Interests by or any capital
    contribution to the Parent (other than any Excluded Contribution), the
    Borrowers will prepay the Loans hereunder in an aggregate amount equal
    to 100% of the Net Cash Proceeds from such offering or sale of Equity
    Interests, provided that (x) if the Senior  Leverage Ratio is less than
    2.75:1.00 but greater than or equal to 2.25:1.00 without giving effect
    to such issuance and the application of the proceeds thereof for the
    period of four consecutive fiscal quarters most recently ended and for
    which financial statements are required to have been delivered pursuant
    to

------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
    Section 6.01(a) or (b), the Borrowers will prepay the Loans hereunder
    in an aggregate amount equal to 75% of the Net Cash Proceeds from such
    offering or sale of Equity Interests and (y) if the Senior  Leverage
    Ratio is less than 2.25:1.00 without giving effect to such issuance and
    the application of the proceeds thereof for the period of four
    consecutive fiscal quarters most recently ended and for which financial
    statements are required to have been delivered pursuant to Section
    6.01(a) or (b), the Borrowers will prepay the Loans hereunder in an
    aggregate amount equal to 50% of the Net Cash Proceeds from such
    offering or sale of Equity Interests.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,
    the Borrowers will make such prepayments in respect of any Net Cash
    Proceeds constituting a Cure Amount in an amount equal to 100% of such
    Net Cash Proceeds.
     
    (vi)                              On the tenth Business Day after the
    receipt by the Administrative Agent or the Parent or any of its
    Subsidiaries of the proceeds of insurance, condemnation award or other
    compensation (other than business interruption insurance proceeds) in
    respect of any Casualty Event affecting any property or assets of the
    Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, the Borrowers shall prepay the Loans
    in an aggregate amount equal to 100% of the Net Cash Proceeds from such
    Casualty Event, provided that the Borrowers shall not be required to
    make any prepayment of the Loans under this Section 2.03(b)(vi) with
    respect to Net Cash Proceeds received by any Borrower or any of its
    Subsidiaries from Casualty Events to the extent if, at the time
    proceeds of insurance, condemnation award or other compensation (other
    than business interruption insurance proceeds) in respect of such
    Casualty Event are received, no Event of Default shall have occurred
    and be continuing, to the extent that, on or prior to the date such Net
    Cash Proceeds would otherwise be required to be so applied the Parent
    notifies the Administrative Agent that such Net Cash Proceeds from such
    Casualty Event are to be reinvested in the repair, restoration or
    replacement of the property affected by such Casualty Event or in other
    assets used or usable in the business of the Borrowers and their
    Subsidiaries within 180 days of the receipt of such proceeds, and if
    such Net Cash Proceeds intended to be reinvested are not in fact
    reinvested then such proceeds shall be due and payable and applied to
    the prepayment of Loans as provided in this clause (v) at the
    expiration of such 180-day period).
     
    (vii)                           Not later than the fifth Business Day
    after the date on which the annual financial statements are required to
    be delivered for any fiscal year (beginning with the fiscal year ending
    June 30, 2015) pursuant to Section 6.01(a), if the Total Leverage Ratio
    is greater than or equal to 2.00:1.00 for the Test Period ending on the
    last day of such fiscal year, the Borrowers will prepay the Loans
    hereunder in an aggregate amount equal to 75% (or, if the Total
    Leverage Ratio is less than 2.50:1.00 but greater than or equal to
    2.00:1.00 for the Test Period ending on the last day of such fiscal
    year, 50%) of the Excess Cash Flow for such fiscal year (or, in the
    case of the prepayment under this clause (vii) for the period ending on
    June 30, 2015, for the period of two consecutive fiscal quarters ending
    on such date) minus the aggregate amount of voluntary prepayments of
    the Term Loans, and Delayed Draw Term Loans and, to the extent
    accompanied by a permanent reduction of the Revolving Commitments,
    Revolving Loans, during such fiscal year or period of two consecutive
    fiscal quarters, as applicable (but, in the case of Term Loans and,
    only to the extent that such voluntary prepayments were applied pro

    rata to remaining installments of the Term Loans or Delayed Draw Term
    Loans, as applicable);
     
    (viii)                        (A) Each prepayment of Loans pursuant to
    this Section 2.03(b) shall be applied first to the Term Loans and any
    Delayed Draw Term Loans then outstanding (and applied pro rata to the
    remaining installments thereof in inverse order of maturity), then to
    the outstanding Revolving Loans and lastly, to the Cash
    Collateralization of Letters of Credit, (B) each such prepayment shall
    be paid to the Lenders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata
    Shares of such prepayment and (C) prepayments of outstanding Revolving
    Loans shall not result in a permanent reduction in the Revolving
    Commitments.
     
(c)                                  The Parent shall notify the 
Administrative Agent in writing of any mandatory prepayment of the Loans 
required to be made pursuant to Section 2.03(b)(iii) through (vii) at least 
two (2) Business Days prior to the required date of such prepayment.  Each 
such notice shall specify the date of such prepayment and provide a 
reasonably detailed calculation of the amount of such prepayment.  The 
Administrative Agent will promptly notify each applicable Lender of the 
contents of the Parents prepayment notice and of such Lenders Pro Rata 
Share or other applicable share of the prepayment.
 
(d)                                 Interest, Funding Losses, etc.  All 
prepayments under this Section 2.03 shall be accompanied by all accrued 
interest thereon, together with, in the case of any such prepayment of a 
Eurodollar Rate Loan on a date prior to the last day of an Interest Period 
therefor, any amounts owing in respect of such Eurodollar Rate Loan 
pursuant to Section 3.05.
 
Section 2.04.                          Termination or Reduction of 
Commitments.
 
(a)                                 Optional.  The Borrowers may, upon 
written notice from the Parent to the Administrative Agent, terminate the 
unused Commitments of any Class, or from time to time permanently reduce 
the unused Commitments of any Class, in each case without premium or 
penalty; provided that (i) any such notice shall be received by the 
Administrative Agent one (1) Business Day prior to the date of termination 
or reduction and (ii) any such partial reduction shall be in an aggregate 
amount of $1,000,000 or any multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof or, if 
less, the entire amount thereof.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parent 
may rescind or postpone any notice of termination of the Commitments if 
such termination would have resulted from a refinancing of all of the 
applicable Credit Facility or any other transaction, which refinancing or 
any other transaction, shall not be consummated or otherwise shall be 
delayed.
 
(b)                                 Mandatory.  The Term Loan Commitment of 
each Lender shall be automatically and permanently reduced to $0 upon the 
making of such Lenders Term Loans pursuant to Section 2.01(a).  The 
Delayed Draw Term Loan Commitment of each Delayed Draw Term Lender shall be 
automatically and permanently reduced to $0 upon the earlier of (i) the 
last day of the Availability Period for the Delayed Draw Term Facility and 
(ii) the date that the aggregate principal amount of the Delayed Draw Term 
Loan borrowed equals the aggregate Delayed Draw Term Loan Commitment.  The 
Delayed Draw Term Loan Commitment of each Delayed Draw Term Lender shall be 
automatically and permanently reduced on the date and in such Lenders

Section 2.06.                          Interest.
 
(a)                                 Subject to the provisions of Section 
2.06(c), (i) each Eurodollar Rate Loan shall bear interest on the 
outstanding principal amount thereof for each Interest Period at a rate per 
annum equal to the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period plus 
the Applicable Rate and (ii) each Base Rate Loan shall bear interest on the 
outstanding principal amount thereof from
 
52
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
the applicable Borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate 
plus the Applicable Rate.
 
(b)                                 (i)                                     
If any amount of principal of any Loan is not paid when due (without regard 
to any applicable grace periods), whether at stated maturity, by 
acceleration or otherwise, such amount shall thereafter bear interest at a 
fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate 
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws.
 
    (ii)                                  If any amount (other than
    principal or interest of any Loan) payable by any Borrower under any
    Loan Document is not paid when due (without regard to any applicable
    grace periods), whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or
    otherwise, then upon the request of the Person to whom such amount is
    owed, such amount shall thereafter bear interest at a fluctuating
    interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the
    fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws.
     
    (iii)                               While any Event of Default exists,
    upon the request of the Required Lenders, the Borrowers shall pay
    interest on the principal amount of all outstanding Obligations
    hereunder at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal
    to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws.
     
(c)                                  If, as a result of any restatement of 
or other adjustment to the financial statements of the Parent or for any 
other reason, the Administrative Agent or the Lenders reasonably determine 
that (i) the Total Leverage Ratio as calculated by the Parent as of any 
applicable date was inaccurate and (ii) a proper calculation of the Total 
Leverage Ratio would have resulted in higher pricing for such period, the 
Borrowers shall immediately and retroactively be obligated to pay to the 
Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Lenders or the 
Issuing Bank, as the case may be, promptly on demand by the Administrative 
Agent (or, after the occurrence of an actual or deemed entry of an order 
for relief with respect to the applicable Borrower under the Bankruptcy 
Code of the United States, automatically and without further action by the 
Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Bank), an amount equal to 
the excess of the amount of interest and fees that should have been paid 
for such period over the amount of interest and fees actually paid for such 
period; provided that if a proper calculation of the Total Leverage Ratio 
would have resulted in lower pricing for such period, such Borrower shall 
receive credit towards the next interest payment(s) in an amount equal to 
the excess of the amount of interest and fees that have been actually paid 
for such period over the amount of interest and fees that should have been 
paid for such period.  This paragraph shall not limit the rights of the 
Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, 
under Section 2.06, 2.07(b) or 2.13(e) or under Article VIII.
 
(d)                                 Interest on each Loan shall be due and 
payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date applicable thereto and at 
such other times as may be specified herein.  Interest hereunder shall be 
due and payable in accordance with the terms hereof before and after 
judgment, and before and after the commencement of any proceeding under any 
Debtor Relief Law.

Section 2.07.                          Fees.
 
(a)                                 The Borrowers shall pay to the 
Administrative Agent for the ratable benefit of the Lenders a commitment 
fee (a Commitment Fee):  (i) with respect to the Revolving Facility, in 
an amount equal to (A) the percentages per annum set forth in the pricing 
grid below based on Total Leverage Ratio as set forth in the most recent 
Compliance Certificate received by the Administrative Agent pursuant to 
Section 6.02(a) multiplied by (B) the difference between the Revolving 
Commitment and the average daily outstanding Revolving Loans (other than 
Swingline Loans) during the immediately preceding quarter, and (ii) with 
respect to the Delayed Draw Term Loans, in an amount equal to 0.50% per 
annum multiplied by the difference between the Delayed Draw Term Loan 
Commitment and the average daily outstanding Delayed Draw Term Loans during 
the immediately preceding quarter.  Until delivery of the Compliance 
Certificate for the fiscal quarter ending on or about December 31, 2014, 
the Commitment Fee rate payable with respect to the Revolving Facility will 
be 0.45% per annum.

Accrued Commitment Fees shall be payable in arrears (A) on the last 
Business Day of March, June, September and December of each year, 
commencing on the first such date to occur after the Closing Date, and (B) 
on the date on which such Commitment terminates.  Commitment Fees shall be 
computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the 
actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the 
last day).  For purposes of computing Commitment Fees in respect of the 
Revolving Loans, a Revolving Commitment of a Lender shall be deemed to be 
used to the extent of the outstanding Revolving Loans and LC Exposure of 
such Lender (and the Swingline Exposure of such Lender shall be disregarded 
for such purpose).
 
(b)                                 The Borrowers shall pay to the 
Administrative Agent for the ratable benefit of the Lenders (including the 
Issuing Bank), a fee calculated at a rate per annum equal to the Applicable 
Rate from time to time for Eurodollar Rate Revolving Loans (the LC 
Participation Fee).  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained 
herein, while any Event of Default under Section 8.01(a) or (f) exists, all 
LC Participation Fees shall accrue at the Default Rate.  In addition, the 
Borrowers shall pay to the Issuing Bank a 0.25% issuance fee, and customary 
negotiations, processing and arranging fees of the Issuing Bank (as agreed 
to by the Borrowers) (the LC Fronting Fee).  Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, any LC Participation Fees and LC Fronting Fees otherwise payable 
for the account of a Defaulting Lender with respect to any Letter of Credit 
as to which such Defaulting Lender has not provided Cash Collateral 
satisfactory to the Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.13 shall be payable, 
to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, to the other Lenders in 
accordance with the upward adjustments in their

respective Applicable Percentages allocable to such Letter of Credit 
pursuant to Section 2.15(a)(iv), with the balance of such fee, if any, 
payable to the Issuing Bank for its own account
 
(c)                                  The Borrowers shall pay to the 
Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Arranger such fees as 
shall have been separately agreed upon in writing in the amounts and at the 
times so specified.  Such fees shall be fully earned when paid and shall 
not be refundable for any reason whatsoever.
 
(d)                                 All fees shall be paid on the dates 
due, in immediately available funds in Dollars, to the Administrative Agent 
for distribution, if and as appropriate, among the Lenders, except that the 
Borrowers shall pay (i) the LC Fronting Fees directly to the Issuing Bank, 
and (ii) the fees provided under Section 2.07(c) directly to the 
Administrative Agent or the Arranger, as the case may be.  Once paid, none 
of the Fees shall be refundable under any circumstances.
 
Section 2.08.                          Computation of Interest and Fees.  
All computations of interest for Base Rate Loans shall be made on the basis 
of a year of 365 days or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual number of 
days elapsed.  All other computations of fees and interest shall be made on 
the basis of a 360 day year and actual number of days elapsed.  Interest 
shall accrue on each Loan for the day on which the Loan is made, and shall 
not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan 
or such portion is paid; provided that any Loan that is repaid on the same 
day on which it is made shall, subject to Section 2.10(a), bear interest 
for one day.  Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest 
rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, 
absent manifest or demonstrable error.
 
Section 2.09.                          Evidence of Indebtedness.
 
(a)                                 The Borrowings made by each Lender 
shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by such 
Lender and evidenced by one or more entries in the Register maintained by 
the Administrative Agent, acting solely for purposes of Treasury Regulation 
Section 5f.103-l(c), as non-fiduciary agent for the Borrowers, in each case 
in the ordinary course of business.  The accounts or records maintained by 
the Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be prima facie evidence 
absent manifest or demonstrable error of the amount of the Borrowings made 
by the Lenders to the Borrowers and the interest and payments thereon.  Any 
failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or 
otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrowers hereunder to pay any 
amount owing with respect to the Obligations.  In the event of any conflict 
between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts 
and records of the Administrative Agent in respect of such matters, the 
accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the 
absence of manifest or demonstrable error.  Upon the request of any Lender 
made through the Administrative Agent, the Borrowers shall execute and 
deliver to such Lender (through the Administrative Agent) a Note payable to 
such Lender, which shall evidence such Lenders Loans in addition to such 
accounts or records.  Each Lender that requests a Note shall attach 
schedules to its Note and shall endorse thereon the date, Type (if 
applicable), amount and maturity of its Loans and payments with respect 
thereto.
 
(b)                                 Entries made in good faith by the 
Administrative Agent in the Register pursuant to Section 2.09(a), and by 
each Lender in its account or accounts pursuant to Section 2.09(a),

------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
shall be prima facie evidence of the amount of principal and interest due 
and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrowers to, in the case 
of the Register, each Lender and, in the case of such account or accounts, 
such Lender, under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, absent 
manifest or demonstrable error; provided that the failure of the 
Administrative Agent or such Lender to make an entry, or any finding that 
an entry is incorrect, in the Register or such account or accounts shall 
not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of the Borrowers under this 
Agreement and the other Loan Documents.
 
Section 2.10.                          Payments Generally.
 
(a)                                 All payments to be made by the 
Borrowers shall be made without condition or deduction for any 
counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff.  Except as otherwise expressly 
provided herein, all payments by the Borrowers hereunder shall be made to 
the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to 
which such payment is owed, at the applicable Administrative Agents Office 
for payment and in Same Day Funds not later than 2:00 p.m. on the date 
specified herein.  The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to 
each Appropriate Lender its Pro Rata Share (or other applicable share as 
provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer 
to such Lenders Lending Office.  All payments received by the 
Administrative Agent shall in each case be deemed received on the Business 
Day so received (or, if received after 2:00 p.m. New York, New York time, 
the succeeding Business Day) and any applicable interest or fee shall 
continue to accrue, but in each case will be credited to the account of the 
applicable Borrower on the following Business Day.
 
(b)                                 If any payment to be made by the 
Borrowers shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall 
be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time 
shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be.
 
(c)                                  Unless the Parent has notified the 
Administrative Agent, prior to the date any payment is required to be made 
by a Borrower to the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of any 
Lender, that such Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative 
Agent may assume that such Borrower has timely made such payment and may 
(but shall not be so required to), in reliance thereon, make available a 
corresponding amount to such Lender.  If and to the extent that such 
payment was not in fact made to the Administrative Agent in Same Day Funds, 
then such Lender shall forthwith on demand repay to the Administrative 
Agent the portion of such assumed payment that was made available to such 
Lender in Same Day Funds, together with interest thereon in respect of each 
day from and including the date such amount was made available by the 
Administrative Agent to such Lender to the date such amount is repaid to 
the Administrative Agent in Same Day Funds at the applicable Overnight Rate 
from time to time in effect.
 
(d)                                 If any Lender makes available to the 
Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender as 
provided in the foregoing provisions of this Article and such funds are not 
made available to the applicable Borrower by the Administrative Agent 
because the conditions to the applicable Borrowing set forth in Article IV 
are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the 
Administrative Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as received 
from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest.
 
56
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
(e)                                  The obligations of the Lenders 
hereunder to make Loans are several and not joint.  The failure of any 
Lender to make any Loan on any date required hereunder shall not relieve 
any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and 
no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so 
make its Loan or purchase its participation.
 
(f)                                   Nothing herein shall be deemed to 
obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular 
place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has 
obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or 
manner.
 
(g)                                  Whenever any payment received by the 
Administrative Agent under this Agreement or any of the other Loan 
Documents is insufficient to pay in full all amounts due and payable to the 
Administrative Agent and the Lenders under or in respect of this Agreement 
and the other Loan Documents on any date, such payment shall be distributed 
by the Administrative Agent and applied by the Administrative Agent and the 
Lenders in the order of priority set forth in Section 8.03.  If the 
Administrative Agent receives funds for application to the Obligations of 
the Loan Parties under or in respect of the Loan Documents under 
circumstances for which the Loan Documents do not specify the manner in 
which such funds are to be applied, the Administrative Agent may, but shall 
not be obligated to, elect to distribute such funds to each of the Lenders 
in accordance with such Lenders Pro Rata Share of such of the outstanding 
Loans or other Obligations then owing to such Lender.
 
Section 2.11.                          Sharing of Payments, etc.  If, other 
than as expressly provided elsewhere herein, any Lender shall obtain 
payment in respect of any principal of or interest on account of the Loans 
made by it (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any 
right of setoff, or otherwise) in excess of its ratable share (or other 
share contemplated hereunder) thereof, such Lender shall immediately (a) 
notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase from the 
other Lenders such participations in the Loans made by them as shall be 
necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment of 
principal of or interest on such Loans, pro rata with each of them; 
provided that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter 
recovered from the purchasing Lender under any of the circumstances 
described in Section 10.06 (including pursuant to any settlement entered 
into by the purchasing Lender in its discretion), such purchase shall to 
that extent be rescinded and each other Lender shall repay to the 
purchasing Lender the purchase price paid therefor, together with an amount 
equal to such paying Lenders ratable share (according to the proportion of 
(i) the amount of such paying Lenders required repayment to (ii) the total 
amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other 
amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total 
amount so recovered, without further interest thereon.  For avoidance of 
doubt, the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to 
(A) any payment made by a Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the 
express terms of this Agreement as in effect from time to time or (B) any 
payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale 
of a participation in any of its Loans to any assignee or participant 
permitted hereunder.  The Borrowers agree that any Lender so purchasing a 
participation from another Lender may, to the fullest extent permitted by 
applicable Law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of 
setoff, but subject to Section 10.09) with respect to such participation as 
fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrowers in the 
amount of such participation.  The Administrative Agent will keep records 
(which shall be conclusive and binding in the absence of manifest or 
demonstrable error) of participations purchased under this Section 2.11 and 
will in
 
57
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
each case notify the Lenders following any such purchases or repayments.  
Each Lender that purchases a participation pursuant to this Section 2.11 
shall from and after such purchase have the right to give all notices, 
requests, demands, directions and other communications under this Agreement 
with respect to the portion of the Obligations purchased to the same extent 
as though the purchasing Lender were the original owner of the Obligations 
purchased.
 
Section 2.12.                          Swingline Loans.
 
(a)                                 Subject to the terms and conditions set 
forth herein, the Swingline Lender agrees to make Swingline Loans to the 
Borrowers from time to time during the Availability Period, in an aggregate 
principal amount at any time outstanding that will not result in (i) the 
aggregate principal amount of outstanding Swingline Loans exceeding 
$2,000,000 or (ii) the sum of the Aggregate Revolving Exposures exceeding 
the lesser of the aggregate Revolving Commitments and Availability; 
provided that the Swingline Lender shall not be required to make a 
Swingline Loan to refinance an outstanding Swingline Loan.  Within the 
foregoing limits and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, 
the Borrowers may borrow, prepay and reborrow Swingline Loans.  To request 
a Swingline Loan, the Parent shall notify the Administrative Agent of such 
request by a Loan Notice by facsimile, not later than noon, New York time, 
on the day of a proposed Swingline Loan and the Borrower to which such 
Swingline Loan is to be made.  Each such notice shall be irrevocable and 
shall specify the requested date (which shall be a Business Day) and amount 
of the requested Swingline Loan.  The Administrative Agent will promptly 
advise the Swingline Lender of any such notice received from the Parent.  
The Swingline Lender shall make each Swingline Loan available to the 
applicable Borrower by means of a credit to such Borrowers Funding Account 
(or, in the case of a Swingline Loan made to finance the reimbursement of 
an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.13(e), by remittance to the 
Issuing Bank) on the requested date of such Swingline Loan.  All Swingline 
Loans shall be Base Rate Loans.
 
(b)                                 The Swingline Lender at any time may, 
and at least once per week shall, by written notice given to the 
Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m., New York time, on any 
Business Day require the Revolving Lenders to acquire participations on 
such Business Day in all or a portion of the Swingline Loans outstanding.  
Such notice shall specify the aggregate amount of Swingline Loans in which 
Revolving Lenders will participate.  Promptly upon receipt of such notice, 
the Administrative Agent will give notice thereof to each Revolving Lender, 
specifying in such notice such Lenders Pro Rata Share of such Swingline 
Loan or Loans.  Each Revolving Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally 
agrees, upon receipt of notice as provided above, to pay to the 
Administrative Agent, for the account of the Swingline Lender, such 
Lenders Pro Rata Share of such Swingline Loan or Loans.  Each Revolving 
Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire 
participations in Swingline Loans pursuant to this paragraph is absolute 
and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, 
including the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or 
termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made 
without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.  Each 
Revolving Lender shall comply with its obligation under this paragraph by 
wire transfer of immediately available funds, in the same manner as 
provided in Section 2.02 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and 
Section 2.02 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of 
the Revolving Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to 
the Swingline Lender the amounts so received by
 
58
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
it from the Revolving Lenders.  The Administrative Agent shall notify the 
Parent of any participations in any Swingline Loan acquired pursuant to 
this paragraph, and thereafter payments in respect of such Swingline Loan 
shall be made to the Administrative Agent and not to the Swingline Lender.  
Any amounts received by the Swingline Lender from the Borrowers (or other 
party on behalf of the Borrowers) in respect of a Swingline Loan after 
receipt by the Swingline Lender of the proceeds of a sale of participations 
therein shall be promptly remitted to the Administrative Agent; any such 
amounts received by the Administrative Agent shall be promptly remitted by 
the Administrative Agent to the Revolving Lenders that shall have made 
their payments pursuant to this paragraph and to the Swingline Lender, as 
their interests may appear; provided that any such payment so remitted 
shall be repaid to the Swingline Lender or to the Administrative Agent, as 
applicable, if and to the extent such payment is required to be refunded to 
the Borrowers for any reason.  The purchase of participations in a 
Swingline Loan pursuant to this paragraph shall not relieve the Borrowers 
of any default in the payment thereof.
 
Section 2.13.                          Letters of Credit.
 
(a)                                 General.  Subject to the terms and 
conditions set forth herein, the Parent may request the issuance of Letters 
of Credit for the account of any Loan Party, in a form reasonably 
acceptable to the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank, at any time 
and from time to time during the Availability Period.  In the event of any 
inconsistency between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the 
terms and conditions of any form of letter of credit application or other 
agreement submitted by any Borrower to, or entered into by any Borrower 
with, the Issuing Bank relating to any Letter of Credit, the terms and 
conditions of this Agreement shall control.
 
(b)                                 Notice of Issuance, Amendment, Renewal. 
 Extension; Certain Conditions.  To request the issuance of a Letter of 
Credit (or the amendment, renewal or extension of an outstanding Letter of 
Credit), the Parent shall deliver by hand or facsimile (or transmit by 
electronic communication, if arrangements for doing so have been approved 
by the Issuing Bank) to the Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent 
(prior to 2:00 pm, New York time, at least five (5) Business Days prior to 
the requested date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension) a notice 
requesting the issuance of a Letter of Credit, or identifying the Letter of 
Credit to be amended, renewed or extended, reasonably satisfactory to the 
Issuing Bank (each, a Letter of Credit Notice) and specifying the date of 
issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (which shall be a Business Day), 
the date on which such Letter of Credit is to expire (which shall comply 
with paragraph (c) of this Section), the amount of such Letter of Credit, 
the name and address of the beneficiary thereof and such other information 
as shall be necessary to prepare, amend, renew or extend such Letter of 
Credit.  If requested by the Issuing Bank, the Borrowers also shall submit 
a letter of credit application on the Issuing Banks standard form in 
connection with any request for a Letter of Credit.  A Letter of Credit 
shall be issued, amended, renewed or extended only if (and upon issuance, 
amendment, renewal or extension of each Letter of Credit the Borrowers and 
the Parent shall be deemed to represent and warrant that), after giving 
effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (i) the LC 
Exposure shall not exceed the Letter of Credit Sublimit, (ii) the Aggregate 
Revolving Exposures shall not exceed the aggregate Revolving Commitments 
and (iii) no default of any Revolving Lenders obligations to fund under 
Section 2.13(d) exists and no Revolving Lender is at that time a Defaulting 
Lender, unless the Issuing Bank has entered into arrangements, including 
the delivery of Cash Collateral,
 
59
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
satisfactory to the Issuing Bank (in its sole discretion) with the 
Borrowers or such Lender to eliminate the Issuing Banks actual or 
potential Fronting Exposure (after giving effect to Section 2.15(a)(iv)) 
with respect to the Defaulting Lender arising from either the Letter of 
Credit then proposed to be issued or that Letter of Credit and all other LC 
Exposure as to which the Issuing Bank has actual or potential Fronting 
Exposure, as it may elect in its sole discretion.
 
(c)                                  Expiration Date.  Each Letter of 
Credit shall expire at or prior to the close of business on the earlier of 
(i) the date one year after the date of the issuance of such Letter of 
Credit (or, in the case of any renewal or extension thereof, one year after 
such renewal or extension) and (ii) the date that is five Business Days 
prior to the Maturity Date for the Revolving Facility.
 
(d)                                 Participations.  By the issuance of a 
Letter of Credit (or an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the 
amount thereof) and without any further action on the part of the Issuing 
Bank or the Revolving Lenders, the Issuing Bank hereby grants to each 
Revolving Lender, and each Revolving Lender hereby acquires from the 
Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such 
Lenders Pro Rata Share of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under 
such Letter of Credit.  In consideration and in furtherance of the 
foregoing, each Revolving Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally 
agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Issuing 
Bank, such Lenders Pro Rata Share of each LC Disbursement made by the 
Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the Borrowers on the date due as 
provided in paragraph (e) of this Section, or of any reimbursement payment 
required to be refunded to the Borrowers for any reason.  Each Revolving 
Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire 
participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit 
is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance 
whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of 
Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or 
termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made 
without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.
 
(e)                                  Reimbursement.  If the Issuing Bank 
shall make any LC Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the 
Borrowers shall reimburse such LC Disbursement by paying to the 
Administrative Agent an amount equal to such LC Disbursement (i) not later 
than 11:00 a.m., New York time, on the date that such LC Disbursement is 
made, if the Parent shall have received notice of such LC Disbursement 
prior to 9:00 a.m., New York time, on such date, or, (ii) if such notice 
has not been received by the Parent prior to such time on such date, then 
not later than 11:00 a.m., New York time, on the Business Day immediately 
following the day that the Parent receives such notice, if such notice is 
not received prior to such time on the day of receipt; provided that the 
Borrowers may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, 
request in accordance with Section 2.01 that such payment be financed with 
a Base Rate Revolving Borrowing or Swingline Loan in an equivalent amount 
and, to the extent so financed, the Borrowers obligation to make such 
payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting Base Rate 
Revolving Borrowing or Swingline Loan.  If the Borrowers fail to make such 
payment when due, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Revolving 
Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from the 
Borrowers in respect thereof and such Lenders Pro Rata Share thereof.  
Promptly following receipt of such notice, each Revolving Lender shall pay 
to the Administrative Agent its Pro Rata Share of the payment then due from 
the Borrowers, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.02 with respect 
to Loans made by such Lender (and
 
60
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 

 
Section 2.02 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of 
the Revolving Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to 
the Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the Revolving Lenders.  
Promptly following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any payment from 
the Borrowers pursuant to this paragraph, the Administrative Agent shall 
distribute such payment to the Issuing Bank or, to the extent that 
Revolving Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to 
reimburse the Issuing Bank, then to such Lenders and the Issuing Bank as 
their interests may appear.  Any payment made by a Revolving Lender 
pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Bank for any LC 
Disbursement (other than the funding of Revolving Loans or a Swingline Loan 
as contemplated above) shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve 
the Borrowers of their obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement.
 
(f)                                   Obligations Absolute.  The Borrowers 
obligation to reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of 
this Section shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be 
performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any 
and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of 
validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or 
any term or provision therein or herein, (ii) any draft or other document 
presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or 
invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate 
in any respect, (iii) payment by the Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit 
against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply with 
the terms of such Letter of Credit, or (iv) any other event or circumstance 
whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but 
for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable 
discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, the Borrowers 
obligations hereunder.  Neither the Administrative Agent, the Revolving 
Lenders nor the Issuing Bank, nor any of their Related Parties, shall have 
any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the 
issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to 
make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances 
referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, 
interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, 
notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit 
(including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error 
in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes 
beyond the control of the Issuing Bank; provided that the foregoing shall 
not be construed to excuse the Issuing Bank from liability to the Borrowers 
to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, 
claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrowers to the extent 
permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Borrowers that are caused by 
the Issuing Banks failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts 
and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the 
terms thereof.  The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of 
bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the 
Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), 
the Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such 
determination.  In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the 
generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents 
presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with 
the terms of a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank may, in its sole 
discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without 
responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or 
information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such 
documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of 
such Letter of Credit.
 
61
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
(g)                                  Disbursement Procedures.  The Issuing 
Bank shall, promptly following its receipt thereof, examine all documents 
purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit.  The 
Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Parent 
by facsimile of such demand for payment and whether the Issuing Bank has 
made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; provided that any failure 
to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrowers of 
its obligation to reimburse the Issuing Bank and the Revolving Lenders with 
respect to any such LC Disbursement.
 
(h)                                 Interim Interest.  If the Issuing Bank 
shall make any LC Disbursement, then, unless the Borrowers shall reimburse 
such LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the 
unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including 
the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the 
Borrowers reimburse such LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum then 
applicable to Base Rate Revolving Loans; provided that, if the Borrowers 
fail to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to paragraph (e) 
of this Section, then Section 2.06(a)(i) shall apply.  Interest accrued 
pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of the Issuing Bank, 
except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any 
Revolving Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section to reimburse the 
Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such 
payment.
 
(i)                                     Replacement of the Issuing Bank.  
The Issuing Bank may be replaced at any time by written agreement among the 
Parent, the Administrative Agent, the replaced Issuing Bank and the 
successor Issuing Bank.  The Administrative Agent shall notify the 
Revolving Lenders of any such replacement of the Issuing Bank.  At the time 
any such replacement shall become effective, the Borrowers shall pay all 
unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced Issuing Bank pursuant 
to Section 2.07(b).  From and after the effective date of any such 
replacement, (i) the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and 
obligations of the Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to 
Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii) references herein to the 
term Issuing Bank shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any 
previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all previous Issuing Banks, 
as the context shall require.  After the replacement of an Issuing Bank 
hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall 
continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under 
this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such 
replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of 
Credit.
 
(j)                                    Cash Collateralization.  (i) Upon 
the request of the Administrative Agent to the Parent, (A) if the Issuing 
Bank has honored any full or partial drawing request under any Letter of 
Credit and such drawing has resulted in an LC Disbursement, or (B) if, as 
of the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, any LC Exposure for any reason 
remains outstanding, the Borrowers shall, in each case, promptly, and in 
any event within one Business Day, Cash Collateralize the then outstanding 
amount of all LC Exposure.  At any time that there shall exist a Defaulting 
Lender that is a Revolving Lender, within three Business Days after the 
request of the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank, the Borrowers 
shall deliver to the Administrative Agent Cash Collateral in an amount 
sufficient to cover all Fronting Exposure (after giving effect to Section 
2.15(a)(iv) and any Cash Collateral provided by the Defaulting Lender).
 
62
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
    (ii)                                  In addition, if the
    Administrative Agent notifies the Parent at any time that the
    outstanding amount of all LC Exposure at such time exceeds 100% of the
    Letter of Credit Sublimit then in effect, then, within two Business
    Days after receipt of such notice, the Borrowers shall Cash
    Collateralize the LC Exposure in an amount equal to the amount by which
    the outstanding amount of all LC Exposure exceeds the Letter of Credit
    Sublimit.
     
    (iii)                               Sections 2.03 and 8.02(c) set forth
    certain additional requirements to deliver Cash Collateral hereunder. 
    For purposes of this Section 2.13, Section 2.03 and Section 8.02(c), 
    Cash Collateralize means to pledge and deposit with or deliver to the
    Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Issuing Bank and the
    Lenders, as collateral for the LC Exposure, cash or deposit account
    balances pursuant to documentation in form and substance reasonably
    satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank (which
    documents are hereby consented to by the Lenders).  Derivatives of such
    term have corresponding meanings.  Upon such pledge and deposit, the
    Borrowers shall grant to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of
    the Issuing Bank and the Lenders, a security interest in all such cash,
    deposit accounts and all balances therein and all proceeds of the
    foregoing.  Cash Collateral shall be maintained in blocked,
    non-interest bearing deposit accounts at Citizens.
     
Section 2.14.                          Increase of Commitments; Additional 
Lenders.
 
(a)                                 After the first anniversary of the 
Closing Date, the Parent may request that the then effective aggregate 
principal amount of the Term Loan Commitments be increased; provided that 
(i) the aggregate principal amount of the increases in the Term Loan 
Commitments pursuant to this Section 2.14 shall not exceed $20,000,000; 
(ii) the Borrowers shall execute and deliver such documents and instruments 
and take such other actions as may be reasonably required by Administrative 
Agent in connection with such increases and at the time of any such 
proposed increase; (iii) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred 
and be continuing or would occur after giving effect to such increase, all 
representations and warranties of each Loan Party set forth in the Loan 
Documents shall be true and correct in all material respects (without 
duplication of materiality qualifiers in the case of those representations 
and warranties that are expressly qualified by a Material Adverse Effect or 
other materiality) on and as of the date of such increase or, to the extent 
such representations and warranties expressly relate to an earlier date, on 
and as of such earlier date; (iv) the incremental Term Loans made under 
this Section 2.14 (Incremental Term Loans) shall have a maturity date no 
earlier than the Maturity Date for the Term Facility, and shall have a 
Weighted Average Life to Maturity no shorter than the Term Loans made under 
Section 2.01(a); (v) after giving effect to any Incremental Term Loans, the 
Borrowers shall be in compliance on a Pro Forma Basis with each of the 
financial covenants specified in Section 7.14, and the Total Leverage Ratio 
shall be lower than the lesser of (A) 2.95:1.00 and (B) the maximum ratio 
permitted under Section 7.14, adjusted by reducing the numerator of such 
ratio by 0.25, in each case as of the most recently ended fiscal quarter 
for which financial statements have been delivered, calculated as if such 
Incremental Term Loans had been made as of the first day of the relevant 
period for testing compliance after giving effect to the borrowing of such 
Incremental Term Loans; (vi) the terms (other than maturity, amortization 
and pricing) of any Incremental Term Loans shall be identical to those of 
the Term Loans made under Section 2.01(a), and if the All-In Yield 
applicable to any Incremental Term
 
63
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Loans exceeds the All-In Yield of the Term Loans existing at such time by 
more than 50 basis points, then the interest rate margins for the Term 
Loans existing at such time shall be increased to the extent necessary so 
that the All-In Yield of such Term Loans is equal to the All-In Yield of 
such Incremental Loans minus 50 basis points, (vii) the proceeds of any 
Incremental Term Loans may be used only to fund Permitted Acquisitions, 
other Investments permitted hereunder, and Capital Expenditures permitted 
hereunder and (viii) all other terms and conditions with respect to the 
Incremental Term Loans shall be reasonably satisfactory to Administrative 
Agent.  The Parent may also, but is not required to (except that the Parent 
shall so notify the Administrative Agent), specify any fees offered to 
those Lenders (the Increasing Lenders) which agree to increase the 
principal amount of their Term Loan Commitments, which fees may be variable 
based upon the amount by which any such Lender increases the principal 
amount of its Term Loan Commitment. No Lender shall have any obligation, 
express or implied, to offer to increase the aggregate principal amount of 
its Term Loan Commitment.
 
(b)                                 Only the consent of each Increasing 
Lender shall be required for an increase in the aggregate principal amount 
of the Term Loan Commitments, pursuant to this Section 2.14. No Lender 
which declines to increase the principal amount of its Term Loan Commitment 
may be replaced in respect to its existing Term Loan Commitment, as 
applicable, as a result thereof without such Lenders consent.
 
(c)                                  Each Increasing Lender shall as soon 
as practicable specify the amount of the proposed increase that it is 
willing to assume. Subject to subsection (a)(5) above, the Borrowers may 
accept some or all of the offered amounts or designate new lenders that are 
acceptable to Administrative Agent (such approval not to be unreasonably 
withheld) as additional Lenders hereunder in accordance with this Section 
2.14 (each such new lender being an Additional Lender), which Additional 
Lenders may assume all or a portion of the Incremental Term Loans.  The 
Administrative Agent shall have discretion to adjust the allocation of 
Incremental Term Loans among Increasing Lenders and Additional Lenders.
 
(d)                                 Subject to subsections (a) and (b) of 
this Section 2.14, any increase requested by the Parent shall be effective 
upon delivery to Administrative Agent of each of the following documents:
 
    (i)                                     an originally executed copy of
    any instrument of joinder signed by a duly authorized officer of each
    Additional Lender, if any, in form and substance reasonably acceptable
    to Administrative Agent;
     
    (ii)                                  a notice to the Increasing
    Lenders and Additional Lenders, in form and substance reasonably
    acceptable to Administrative Agent, signed by a Responsible Officer of
    the Parent; (iii) a certificate of the Parent signed by a Responsible
    Officer, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Administrative
    Agent, certifying that each of the conditions in subsection (a) of this
    Section 2.14 has been satisfied; (iv) to the extent requested by any
    Additional Lender or Increasing Lender, executed promissory notes
    evidencing the Incremental Term Loan issued by the Borrowers in
    accordance with Section 2.09 and (v) any other certificates or
    documents that Administrative Agent shall reasonably request, in form
    and substance reasonably satisfactory to Administrative Agent. Any such
    increase shall be in a principal amount equal to the sum of the
    principal
 
64
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
    amount of the Incremental Term Loans that the Increasing Lenders and
    Additional Lenders are willing to assume, as applicable, as adjusted by
    the Parent and Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 2.14. Upon
    effectiveness of any such increase, the Commitments and Pro Rata Share
    of each Lender will be adjusted to give effect to the Incremental Term
    Loans, as applicable.
     
(e)                                  Commitments in respect of Incremental 
Loans shall become Commitments under this Agreement pursuant to an 
amendment (an Incremental Amendment) to this Agreement and, as 
appropriate, the other Loan Documents, executed by the Borrowers, each 
Lender agreeing to provide such Commitment, if any, each Additional Lender, 
if any, and the Administrative Agent.  The Incremental Amendment may, 
without the consent of any other Lenders, effect such amendments to this 
Agreement and the other Loan Documents as may be necessary or appropriate, 
in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent and the Parent, to 
effect the provisions of this Section 2.14.  The Administrative Agent is 
expressly permitted to amend the Loan Documents to the extent necessary to 
give effect to any increase pursuant to this Section 2.14 and mechanical 
changes necessary or advisable in connection therewith (including 
amendments to implement the requirements in the preceding two sentences and 
amendments to ensure pro rata allocations of Eurodollar Loans and Base Rate 
Loans between Loans incurred pursuant to this Section 2.14 and Loans 
outstanding immediately prior to any such incurrence).
 
(f)                                   This Section 2.14 shall supersede any 
provisions in Section 2.11 or 10.01 to the contrary.
 
Section 2.15.                          Defaulting Lenders.
 
(a)                                 Defaulting Lender Adjustments.  
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if 
any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as such 
Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by 
applicable law:
 
    (i)                                     Waivers and Amendments.  Such
    Defaulting Lenders right to approve or disapprove any amendment,
    waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as
    set forth in the definition of Required Lenders.
     
    (ii)                                  Defaulting Lender Waterfall. Any
    payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the
    Administrative Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender (whether
    voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Article VIII or
    otherwise) or received by the Administrative Agent from a Defaulting
    Lender pursuant to Section 10.09 shall be applied at such time or times
    as may be determined by the Administrative Agent as follows: first, to
    the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the
    Administrative Agent hereunder; second, to the payment on a pro rata
    basis of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to any Issuing
    Bank or Swingline Lender hereunder; third, to Cash Collateralize the
    Issuing Banks Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender
    in accordance with Section 2.13(j); fourth, as the Parent may request
    (so long as no Default or Event of Default exists), to the funding of
    any Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund
    its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the
    Administrative Agent; fifth, if so determined by the Administrative
    Agent and the Parent, to be held in a
 
65
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
    deposit account and released pro rata in order to (x) satisfy such
    Defaulting Lenders potential future funding obligations with respect
    to Loans under this Agreement and (y) Cash Collateralize the Issuing
    Banks future Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender
    with respect to future Letters of Credit issued under this Agreement,
    in accordance with Section 2.13(j); sixth, to the payment of any
    amounts owing to the Lenders, the Issuing Banks or Swingline Lenders as
    a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained
    by any Lender, the Issuing Banks or Swingline Lenders against such
    Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lenders breach of its
    obligations under this Agreement; seventh, so long as no Default or
    Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the
    Borrowers as a result of any judgment of a court of competent
    jurisdiction obtained by a Borrower against such Defaulting Lender as a
    result of such Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under this
    Agreement; and eighth, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise
    directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if (x)
    such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans or LC
    Disbursements in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has not fully
    funded its appropriate share, and (y) such Loans were made or the
    related Letters of Credit were issued at a time when the conditions set
    forth in Section 4.02 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be
    applied solely to pay the Loans of, and LC Disbursements owed to, all
    non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to
    the payment of any Loans of, or LC Disbursements owed to, such
    Defaulting Lender until such time as all Loans and funded and unfunded
    participations in obligations in respect of Letters of Credit and
    Swingline Loans are held by the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the
    Commitments under the applicable Facility without giving effect to
    Section 2.15(a)(iv). Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or
    payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay
    amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post Cash Collateral pursuant
    to this Section 2.15(a)(ii) shall be deemed paid to and redirected by
    such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.
     
    (iii)                               Certain Fees.
     
        (A)                               No Defaulting Lender shall be
        entitled to receive any Commitment Fee for any period during which
        that Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and the Borrowers shall not be
        required to pay any such fee that otherwise would have been
        required to have been paid to that Defaulting Lender).
         
        (B)                               Each Defaulting Lender shall be
        entitled to receive any LC Participation Fee or LC Fronting Fee for
        any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender only to
        the extent allocable to its Applicable Percentage of the stated
        amount of Letters of Credit for which it has provided Cash
        Collateral pursuant to Section 2.13(j).
         
        (C)                               With respect to any Commitment
        Fee, LC Participation Fee or LC Fronting Fee not required to be
        paid to any Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (A) or (B) above,
        the Borrowers shall (x) pay to each non-Defaulting Lender that
        portion of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender
        with respect to such Defaulting Lenders participation in Letters
        of Credit or Swingline Loans that has been reallocated to such
        non-Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (iv)
 
66
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
        below, (y) pay to each Issuing Bank and Swingline Lender, as
        applicable, the amount of any such fee otherwise payable to such
        Defaulting Lender to the extent allocable to such Issuing Banks or
        Swingline Lenders Fronting Exposure to such Defaulting Lender, and
        (z) not be required to pay the remaining amount of any such fee.
         
    (iv)                              Reallocation of Participations to
    Reduce Fronting Exposure.  All or any part of such Defaulting Lenders
    participation in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans shall be
    reallocated among the non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their
    respective Applicable Percentages (calculated without regard to such
    Defaulting Lenders Commitment) but only to the extent that (x) the
    conditions set forth in Section 4.02 are satisfied at the time of such
    reallocation (and, unless the Parent shall have otherwise notified the
    Administrative Agent at such time, the Borrowers shall be deemed to
    have represented and warranted that such conditions are satisfied at
    such time), and (y) such reallocation does not cause the aggregate
    Revolving Exposure of any non-Defaulting Lender to exceed such
    non-Defaulting Lenders Revolving Commitment.  No reallocation
    hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any
    party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender
    having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a
    non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such non-Defaulting Lenders
    increased exposure following such reallocation.
     
    (v)                                 Cash Collateral, Repayment of
    Swingline Loans.  If the reallocation described in clause (iv) above
    cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrowers shall,
    without prejudice to any right or remedy available to it hereunder or
    under law, (x) first, prepay Swingline Loans in an amount equal to the
    Swingline Lenders Fronting Exposure and (y) second, Cash Collateralize
    the Issuing Banks Fronting Exposure in accordance with the procedures
    set forth in Section 2.13(j).
     
(b)                                 Defaulting Lender Cure.  If the Parent, 
the Administrative Agent and each Swingline Lender and Issuing Bank agree 
in writing that a Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, the 
Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the 
effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set 
forth therein (which may include arrangements with respect to any Cash 
Collateral), that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par 
that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take such other 
actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause 
the Loans and funded and unfunded participations in Letters of Credit and 
Swingline Loans to be held pro rata by the Lenders in accordance with the 
Commitments under the applicable Facility (without giving effect to Section 
2.15(a)(ii), whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; 
provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to 
fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrowers while that 
Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided, further, that except to the 
extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change 
hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or 
release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lenders 
having been a Defaulting Lender.
 
(c)                                  New Swingline Loans/Letters of Credit
.  So long as any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, (i) the Swingline Lender 
shall not be required to fund any Swingline Loans unless it is satisfied 
that it will have no Fronting Exposure after giving effect to such 
Swingline Loan and (ii)
 
67
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
no Issuing Bank shall be required to issue, extend, renew or increase any 
Letter of Credit unless it is satisfied that it will have no Fronting 
Exposure after giving effect thereto.
 
Section 2.16.                          Obligations of the Borrowers; 
Appointment of the Parent as Agent.
 
(a)                                 The Obligations of all Borrowers shall 
be joint and several in nature as provided in the Guarantee and Collateral 
Agreement.
 
(b)                                 Each Borrower hereby irrevocably 
appoints the Parent as its agent for all purposes relevant to this 
Agreement and each of the other Loan Documents, including (i) the giving 
and receipt of notices, (ii) the execution and delivery of all documents, 
instruments and certificates contemplated herein and all modifications 
hereto, and (iii) the receipt of the proceeds of any Loans made by the 
Lenders to any such Borrower hereunder.  Any acknowledgment, consent, 
direction, certification or other action which might otherwise be valid or 
effective only if given or taken by all Borrowers, or by any Borrower 
acting singly, shall be valid and effective if given or taken only by the 
Parent, whether or not any such other Borrower joins therein. Any notice, 
demand, consent, acknowledgement, direction, certification or other 
communication delivered to the Parent in accordance with the terms of this 
Agreement shall be deemed to have been delivered to each Borrower.
 
ARTICLE III.
 
Taxes, Increased Costs Protection and Illegality
 
Section 3.01.                          Taxes.  For the purposes of this 
Section 3.01, the term Lender includes any Issuing Bank and the term 
applicable law includes FATCA.
 
(a)                                 Except as required by applicable law, 
any and all payments by any Loan Party to or for the account of any Agent 
or any Lender under any Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and 
without deduction for any and all present or future taxes, duties, levies, 
imposts, deductions, assessments, fees, withholdings or similar charges, 
and all liabilities (including additions to tax, penalties and interest) 
with respect thereto (Taxes).  If any applicable law (as determined in 
the good faith discretion of an applicable withholding agent) requires an 
applicable withholding agent to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any 
sum payable by a Loan Party under any Loan Document to any Agent or any 
Lender, (i) if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, the sum payable by such Loan 
Party shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required 
deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable 
under this Section 3.01(a)), each of such Agent and such Lender receives an 
amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been 
made, (ii) the applicable withholding agent shall make such deductions, and 
(iii) the applicable withholding agent shall pay the full amount deducted 
to the relevant taxing authority.  Within thirty (30) days after the date 
of the payment of Taxes by any Loan Party to a Governmental Authority 
pursuant to this Section 3.01 (or, if receipts or evidence are not 
available within thirty (30) days, as soon as practicable thereafter), such 
Loan Party shall furnish to the Administrative Agent the original or a 
facsimile copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof to the extent such a 
receipt has been made available to such Loan Party (or other evidence of 
payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent).  If a Loan 
Party fails to pay any Indemnified Taxes when due to the
 
68
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
appropriate taxing authority or fails to remit to any Agent or any Lender 
the required receipts or other required documentary evidence that has been 
made available to such Loan Party, such Loan Party shall indemnify such 
Agent and such Lender for any incremental Taxes that may become payable by 
such Agent or such Lender arising out of such failure.
 
(b)                                 Each Lender (including an Eligible 
Assignee to which a Lender assigns its interest in accordance with Section 
10.07) that is not a United States person within the meaning of Section 
7701(a)(30) of the Code (each a Foreign Lender) agrees to complete and 
deliver to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the 
date on which such Foreign Lender (or Eligible Assignee) becomes a party 
hereto and at the time or times prescribed by applicable Law, two (2) 
accurate, complete and original signed copies of whichever of the following 
is applicable:  (i) IRS Form W-8BEN certifying that it is entitled to 
benefits under an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party; 
(ii) IRS Form W-ECI certifying that the income receivable pursuant to any 
Loan Document is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or 
business in the United States; (iii) if the Foreign Lender is not (A) a 
bank described in Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (B) a 10-percent 
shareholder described in Section 871(h)(3)(B) of the Code, and (C) a 
controlled foreign corporation related to any Borrower within the meaning 
of Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code, a certificate to that effect in 
substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit F-1, F-2, F-3 or F-4, as 
applicable (a Non-Bank Certificate) and an IRS Form W-8BEN, certifying 
that the Foreign Lender is not a United States person; (iv) to the extent a 
Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner for U.S. federal income tax 
purposes, IRS Form W-8IMY (or any successor forms) of the Foreign Lender, 
accompanied by, as and to the extent applicable, a Form W-8BEN, Form W-ECI, 
Non-Bank Certificate, Form W-9 (or other successor forms) and any other 
required supporting information from each beneficial owner (it being 
understood that a Foreign Lender need not provide certificates or 
supporting documentation from beneficial owners if such Foreign Lender is 
able to establish, and does establish, to the reasonable satisfaction of 
the Parent and the Administrative Agent that payments to such Foreign 
Lender are, to the extent applicable, entitled to an exemption from or, if 
an exemption is not available, a reduction in the rate of, U.S. federal 
withholding taxes without providing such certificates or supporting 
documentation); or (v) any other form prescribed by applicable requirements 
of U.S. federal income tax law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a 
reduction in U.S. federal withholding tax duly completed together with such 
supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable requirements 
of law to permit the Parent and the Administrative Agent to determine the 
withholding or deduction required to be made.  Each Foreign Lender agrees 
that if any form or certification it previously delivered pursuant to this 
paragraph (b) expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it 
shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and 
the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.
 
(c)                                  In addition, each such Foreign Lender 
shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, (i) promptly submit 
to the Parent and the Administrative Agent two (2) accurate, complete and 
original signed copies of such other or additional forms or certificates 
(or such successor forms or certificates as shall be adopted from time to 
time by the relevant taxing authorities) as may then be applicable or 
available to secure an exemption from or reduction in the rate of, or to 
determine the withholding or deduction required to be made on account of, 
U.S. federal withholding tax (A) on or before the date that such Foreign 
Lenders most recently delivered form, certificate or other evidence 
expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any material
 
69
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
respect (or promptly notifies the Parent and Administrative Agent in 
writing of its legal inability to do so), (B) after the occurrence of a 
change in the Foreign Lenders circumstances requiring a change in the most 
recent form, certificate or evidence previously delivered by it to the 
Parent and the Administrative Agent, and (C) from time to time thereafter 
if reasonably requested by a Borrower or the Administrative Agent, and (ii) 
promptly notify the Parent and the Administrative Agent of any change in 
the Foreign Lenders circumstances which would modify or render invalid any 
claimed exemption or reduction.
 
(d)                                 Each Lender that is a United States 
person (within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) (each a 
U.S. Lender) agrees to complete and deliver to the Parent and the 
Administrative Agent two (2) original copies of accurate, complete and 
signed IRS Form W-9 or successor form certifying that such U.S. Lender is 
not subject to United States backup withholding tax (i) on or prior to the 
Closing Date (or on or prior to the date it becomes a party to this 
Agreement), (ii) on or before the date that such form expires or becomes 
obsolete or inaccurate in any material respect (or promptly notifies the 
Parent and Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do 
so), (iii) after the occurrence of a change in such U.S. Lenders 
circumstances requiring a change in the most recent form previously 
delivered by it to the Parent and the Administrative Agent, and (iv) from 
time to time thereafter if reasonably requested by the Parent or the 
Administrative Agent.
 
(e)                                  The Loan Parties agree to timely pay 
any and all present or future stamp, court or documentary taxes and any 
other excise, property, intangible or mortgage recording taxes or charges 
or similar levies which arise from any payment made under any Loan Document 
or from the execution, delivery, performance, enforcement or registration 
of, or otherwise with respect to, any Loan Document (including additions to 
tax, penalties and interest related thereto) (all such non-excluded taxes 
described in this Section 3.01(e) being hereinafter referred to as Other 
Taxes).
 
(f)                                   If claims for any Indemnified Taxes 
are paid or payable by any Agent or Lender with respect to any payment 
received by such Agent or Lender in respect of any Loan Document, such 
Agent or Lender may pay such Indemnified Taxes and the Loan Parties will 
promptly jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless such Agent or 
Lender for the full amount of such Indemnified Taxes (and any Indemnified 
Taxes imposed on amounts payable under this Section 3.01), and any 
reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or 
not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted.  
Payments under this Section 3.01(f) shall be made within ten (10) days 
after the date the Parent receives written demand for payment from such 
Agent or Lender.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or 
liability delivered to the Parent by a Lender (with a copy to the 
Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or 
on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
 
(g)                                  Each Lender shall severally indemnify 
the Administrative Agent for any and all Taxes (but, in the case of any 
Indemnified Taxes, only to the extent that the Borrowers have not already 
indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without 
limiting the obligation of the Borrowers to do so) attributable to such 
Lender or attributable to such Lenders failure to comply with Section 
10.07(e) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register that are 
paid or payable by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 

 
Document and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect 
thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or 
asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  The indemnity under this 
Section 3.01(g) shall be paid within ten (10) days after the Administrative 
Agent delivers to the applicable Lender a certificate stating the amount of 
taxes so paid or payable by the Administrative Agent.  Such certificate 
shall be conclusive of the amount so paid or payable absent manifest error. 
 Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and 
apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan 
Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to the Lender 
from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent 
under this paragraph (g).
 
(h)                                 If a payment made to a Lender under any 
Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by 
FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting 
requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 
1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the 
Parent and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law 
and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Parent or the 
Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law 
(including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such 
additional documentation reasonably requested by the Parent or the 
Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Parent and the 
Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to 
determine that such Lender has complied with such Lenders obligations 
under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such 
payment.  Solely for purposes of this clause (D), FATCA shall include any 
amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
 
(i)                                     If any Agent or any Lender 
determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has 
received a refund in respect of any Taxes as to which it has been 
indemnified by the Borrowers, or with respect to which the Borrowers have 
paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 3.01, it shall promptly 
remit such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or 
additional amounts paid, by the Borrowers under this Section 3.01 with 
respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket 
expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent or such Lender and without 
interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental 
Authority with respect to such refund), provided that the Borrowers, upon 
the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agree to repay the 
amount paid over to the Borrowers (plus any penalties, interest or other 
charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the 
Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent 
or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental 
Authority.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (i), 
in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an 
indemnifying party pursuant to this paragraph (i) the payment of which 
would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax 
position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject 
to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, 
withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or 
additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid.  The 
Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, shall provide the 
Parent with a copy of any notice of assessment or other evidence reasonably 
available of the requirement to repay such refund received from the 
relevant Governmental Authority (provided that such Lender or the 
Administrative Agent may delete any information therein that such Lender or 
the Administrative Agent deems confidential in its sole discretion).  This 
subsection
 
71
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to 
make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its 
Taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrowers or any other Person.
 
(j)                                    The agreements in this Section 3.01 
shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or 
any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the 
termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other 
amounts payable hereunder.
 
Section 3.02.                          Illegality.  If any Lender 
determines that any Change in Law has made it unlawful, or that any 
Governmental Authority has asserted after the Closing Date that it is 
unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain 
or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to the Eurodollar 
Rate, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurodollar 
Rate or Adjusted Eurodollar Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed 
material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, 
or to take deposits of, Dollars in the London interbank market, then, on 
notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrowers through the Administrative 
Agent, (i) any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Eurodollar 
Rate Loans or to convert Base Rate Loans to Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be 
suspended, and (ii) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender 
making or maintaining Base Rate Loans the interest rate on which is 
determined by reference to the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate component of the 
Base Rate, the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, 
if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative 
Agent without reference to the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate component of the 
Base Rate, in each case until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent 
and the Borrowers that the circumstances giving rise to such determination 
no longer exist.  Upon receipt of such notice, (x) the Borrowers may revoke 
any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of 
Eurodollar Rate Loans and shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy 
to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, at the Borrowers option, convert 
all Eurodollar Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans (the interest 
rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid 
such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without 
reference to the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate), 
either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may 
lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans to such day, or 
immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such 
Eurodollar Rate Loans and (y) if such notice asserts the illegality of such 
Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon the Adjusted 
Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate with respect to any Base Rate 
Loans, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension 
compute the Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the 
Adjusted Eurodollar Rate component thereof until the Administrative Agent 
is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such 
Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurodollar 
Rate.  Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrowers shall also pay 
accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted.
 
Section 3.03.                          Inability to Determine Rates.  If 
the Required Lenders determine that for any reason in connection with any 
request for a Eurodollar Rate Loan or a conversion to or continuation 
thereof that (a) Dollar deposits are not being offered to banks in the 
London interbank eurodollar market for the applicable amount and Interest 
Period of such Eurodollar Rate Loan, (b) adequate and reasonable means do 
not exist for determining the Eurodollar Rate
 
72
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar 
Rate Loan or in connection with an existing or proposed Base Rate Loan, or 
(c) the Eurodollar Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a 
proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the 
cost to such Lenders of funding such Loan, the Administrative Agent will 
promptly so notify each Borrower and each Lender.  Thereafter, (x) the 
obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans shall 
be suspended, and (y) in the event of a determination described in the 
preceding sentence with respect to the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate component 
of the Base Rate, the utilization of the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate component 
in determining the Base Rate shall be suspended, in each case until the 
Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes 
such notice.  Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrowers may revoke any 
pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of 
Eurodollar Rate Loans or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted 
such request into a request for a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the 
amount specified therein.
 
Section 3.04.                          Increased Cost and Reduced Return; 
Capital Adequacy; Reserves on Eurodollar Rate Loans.
 
(a)                                 Increased Costs Generally.  If any 
Change in Law shall:
 
    (i)                                     impose, modify or deem
    applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance
    charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for
    the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender;
     
    (ii)                                  subject any Lender or Agent to
    any Tax of any kind whatsoever with respect to this Agreement or any
    Eurodollar Rate Loan made by it, or change the basis of taxation of
    payments to such Lender in respect thereof (except for Indemnified
    Taxes covered by Section 3.01 and the imposition of, or any change in
    the rate of, any Excluded Tax); or
     
    (iii)                               impose on any Lender or the London
    interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this
    Agreement or Eurodollar Rate Loans made by such Lender that is not
    otherwise accounted for in the definition of Adjusted Eurodollar Rate
    or this clause (a);
     
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to 
such Lender of making or maintaining any Loan the interest on which is 
determined by reference to the Eurodollar Rate (or of maintaining its 
obligation to make any such Loan), or to increase the cost to such Lender, 
or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender 
(whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then from time to time 
upon written demand of such Lender setting forth in reasonable detail the 
charge and the calculation of such additional costs or reduction suffered 
(with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent), the Borrowers 
will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will 
compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction 
suffered.
 
(b)                                 Capital Requirements.  If any Lender 
determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or any Lending 
Office of such Lender or such Lenders holding company, if any, regarding 
capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of 
return
 
73
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
on such Lenders capital or on the capital of such Lenders holding 
company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of 
such Lender or the Loans made by it to a level below that which such Lender 
or such Lenders holding company could have achieved but for such Change in 
Law (taking into consideration such Lenders policies and the policies of 
such Lenders holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from 
time to time upon demand of such Lender setting forth in reasonable detail 
the charge and the calculation of such reduced rate of return (with a copy 
of such demand to the Administrative Agent), the Borrowers will pay to such 
Lender, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will 
compensate such Lender or such Lenders holding company for any such 
reduction suffered.
 
(c)                                  Certificates for Reimbursement.  A 
certificate of a Lender setting forth, in reasonable detail, the 
calculation of the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or 
its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsection (a) or 
(b) of this Section 3.04 and delivered to the Borrowers shall be conclusive 
absent manifest or demonstrable error.  The Borrowers shall pay such 
Lender, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate 
within fifteen (15) days after receipt thereof.
 
(d)                                 Delay in Requests.  Failure or delay on 
the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing 
provisions of this Section 3.04 shall not constitute a waiver of such 
Lenders right to demand such compensation, provided that the Borrowers 
shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to the foregoing 
provisions of this Section 3.04 for any increased costs incurred or 
reductions suffered more than one hundred and eighty (180) days prior to 
the date that such Lender notifies the Borrowers of the Change in Law 
giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lenders 
intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law 
giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 
180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of 
retroactive effect thereof).
 
Section 3.05.                          Funding Losses.  Upon written demand 
of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to time, 
which demand shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for requesting 
such amount, the Borrowers shall promptly compensate such Lender for and 
hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as 
a result of:
 
(a)                                 any continuation, conversion, payment 
or prepayment of any Eurodollar Loan on a day prior to the last day of the 
Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by 
reason of acceleration, or otherwise);
 
(b)                                 any failure by any Borrower (for a 
reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, 
borrow, continue or convert to any Eurodollar Loan on the date or in the 
amount notified by any Borrower; or
 
(c)                                  any assignment of a Eurodollar Rate 
Loan on a day prior to the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a 
result of a request by a Borrower pursuant to Section 3.07;
 
including any loss or expense (excluding loss of anticipated profits or 
margin) actually incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of 
funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to 
terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained.
 
74
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Section 3.06.                          Matters Applicable to All Requests 
for Compensation.
 
(a)                                 Designation of a Different Lending 
Office.  If any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.04, or the 
Borrowers are required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any 
Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 
3.01, or if any Lender gives a notice pursuant to Section 3.02, then such 
Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different Lending Office 
for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and 
obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, 
if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) 
would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.01 or 3.04, 
as the case may be, in the future, or eliminate the need for the notice 
pursuant to Section 3.02, as applicable, and (ii) in each case, would not 
subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense and would 
not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender in any material economic, 
legal or regulatory respect.
 
(b)                                 Suspension of Lender Obligations.  If 
any Lender requests compensation by the Borrowers under Section 3.04, the 
Borrowers may, by notice to such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative 
Agent), suspend the obligation of such Lender to make or continue 
Eurodollar Rate Loans from one Interest Period to another Interest Period, 
or to convert Base Rate Loans into Eurodollar Rate Loans, until the event 
or condition giving rise to such request ceases to be in effect (in which 
case the provisions of Section 3.06(c) shall be applicable); provided that 
such suspension shall not affect the right of such Lender to receive the 
compensation so requested.
 
(c)                                  Conversion of Eurodollar Rate Loans.  
If any Lender gives notice to the Borrowers (with a copy to the 
Administrative Agent) that the circumstances specified in Section 3.03 or 
3.04 hereof that gave rise to the conversion of such Lenders Eurodollar 
Rate Loans no longer exist (which such Lender agrees to do promptly upon 
such circumstances ceasing to exist) at a time when Eurodollar Rate Loans 
made by other Lenders are outstanding, such Lenders Base Rate Loans shall 
be automatically converted, on the first day(s) of the next succeeding 
Interest Period(s) for such outstanding Eurodollar Rate Loans, to the 
extent necessary so that, after giving effect thereto, all Loans of a given 
Class held by the Lenders of such Class holding Eurodollar Rate Loans and 
by such Lender are held pro rata (as to principal amounts, interest rate 
basis, and Interest Periods) in accordance with their respective Pro Rata 
Shares.
 
Section 3.07.                          Replacement of Lenders under Certain 
Circumstances.  If (i) any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.04 
or ceases to make Eurodollar Rate Loans as a result of any condition 
described in Section 3.02 or Section 3.04, (ii) the Borrowers are required 
to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority 
for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.01, or (iii) any Lender 
is a Non-Consenting Lender (as defined below), then the Borrowers may, at 
their sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the 
Administrative Agent, require such Non-Consenting Lender to assign and 
delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the 
restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section 10.07), all of 
its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement and the related 
Loan Documents to one or more Eligible Assignees that shall assume such 
obligations (any of which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender 
accepts such assignment), provided that:
 
(a)                                 the Administrative Agent shall have 
received the assignment fee specified in Section 10.07(b)(iv), if any;
 
75
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
(b)                                 such Lender shall have received payment 
of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans, accrued 
interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it 
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including any amounts under 
Section 3.05) from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding 
principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrowers (in the case of 
all other amounts);
 
(c)                                  such Lender being replaced pursuant to 
this Section 3.07 shall (i) execute and deliver an Assignment and 
Assumption with respect to such Lenders Commitment and outstanding Loans, 
and (ii) deliver any Notes evidencing such Loans to the Borrowers or 
Administrative Agent (or a lost or destroyed note indemnity in lieu 
thereof); provided that the failure of any such Lender to execute an 
Assignment and Assumption or deliver such Notes shall not render such sale 
and purchase (and the corresponding assignment) invalid and such assignment 
shall be recorded in the Register and the Notes shall be deemed to be 
canceled upon such failure;
 
(d)                                 the Eligible Assignee shall become a 
Lender hereunder (if not already a Lender hereunder) and the assigning 
Lender shall cease to constitute a Lender hereunder with respect to such 
assigned Loans, Commitments and participations, except with respect to 
indemnification provisions under this Agreement, which shall survive as to 
such assigning Lender;
 
(e)                                  in the case of any such assignment 
resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 3.04 or payments 
required to be made pursuant to Section 3.01, such assignment will result 
in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter; and
 
(f)                                   such assignment does not conflict 
with applicable Laws.
 
In the event that (i) a Borrower or the Administrative Agent has requested 
that the Lenders consent to a departure or waiver of any provisions of the 
Loan Documents or agree to any amendment thereto, (ii) the consent, waiver 
or amendment in question requires the agreement of each Lender, all 
affected Lenders or all the Lenders or all affected Lenders with respect to 
a certain Class or Classes of the Loans and (iii) the Required Lenders or 
Required Facility Lenders, as applicable, have agreed to such consent, 
waiver or amendment, then any Lender who does not agree to such consent, 
waiver or amendment shall be deemed a Non-Consenting Lender.
 
A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation 
if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the 
circumstances entitling the Borrowers to require such assignment and 
delegation cease to apply.
 
Section 3.08.                          Survival.  All of the Borrowers 
obligations under this Article III shall survive termination of the 
Aggregate Commitments, repayment of all other Obligations hereunder and 
resignation of the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent.

and data furnished in writing by or on behalf of any Loan Party to any 
Agent or any Lender on or before the Closing Date in connection with the

circumstances under which it was delivered, not materially misleading; it 
being understood that for purposes of this Section 5.16, such information 
and data shall not include projections and pro forma financial information 
or information of a general economic or general industry nature.
 
Section 5.17.                          Collateral Documents.  The

licenses and other intellectual property rights (collectively, 
Intellectual Property) that are necessary for the operation of their 
respective businesses as currently conducted, except where the failure to 
have any such rights, either individually or in the aggregate, would not 
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.  To the knowledge 
of the Parent, the operation of the respective businesses of the Parent or 
any of its Subsidiaries as currently conducted does not infringe upon, 
misuse, misappropriate or violate any rights held by any Person except for 
such infringements, misuses, misappropriations or violations individually 
or in the aggregate, that would not reasonably be expected to have a 
Material Adverse Effect.  No claim or litigation regarding any Intellectual

any Loan Party or Subsidiary, that, either individually or in the 
aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

perform or observe any term, covenant or agreement contained in any of 
Sections 6.01, 6.02, 6.03, 6.05(a), 6.07, 6.10, 6.11, 6.13, 6.17 (including 
the items set forth in Schedule 6.17) or Article VII; or
 
(c)           Other Defaults.  Any Loan Party fails to perform or observe 
any other covenant or agreement (not specified in Section 8.01(a) or (b) 
above) contained in any Loan Document on its part to be performed or 
observed and such failure continues for thirty (30) days after receipt by 
the Parent of written notice thereof from the Administrative Agent; or
 
(d)           Representations and Warranties.  Any representation, 
warranty, certification or statement of fact made or deemed made by any 
Loan Party herein, in any other Loan Document, or in any document required 
to be delivered in connection herewith or therewith shall be untrue in any 
material respect (without duplication of materiality qualifiers in the case 
of those representations and warranties that are expressly qualified by a 
Material Adverse Effect or other materiality) when made or deemed made; or
 
(e)           Cross-Default.  Any Loan Party or any Subsidiary (i) fails to 
make any payment prior to the expiration of any applicable grace period 
with respect thereto, if any, (whether by scheduled maturity, required 
prepayment, acceleration, demand, or otherwise) in respect of any Material 
Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness hereunder) or (ii) fails to observe 
or perform any other agreement or condition relating to any such 
Indebtedness, or any other event occurs, the effect of which default or 
other event is to cause, or to permit the holder or holders of such 
Indebtedness (or a trustee or agent on behalf of such holder or holders or 
beneficiary or beneficiaries) to cause, with the giving of notice if 
required, such Indebtedness to become due or to be repurchased, prepaid, 
defeased or redeemed (automatically or otherwise), or an offer to 
repurchase, prepay, defease or redeem such Indebtedness to be made, prior 
to its stated maturity; provided that this clause (e) shall not apply to 
secured Indebtedness that becomes due as a result of the voluntary sale or 
transfer of the property or assets securing such Indebtedness, if such sale 
or transfer is permitted hereunder and under the documents providing for 
such Indebtedness; or
 
(f)            Insolvency Proceedings, etc.  The Parent, any Borrower or 
any Subsidiary institutes or consents to the institution of any proceeding 
under any Debtor Relief Law, or makes an assignment for the benefit of 
creditors; or applies for or consents to the appointment of any receiver, 
trustee, custodian, conservator, liquidator, rehabilitator, administrator, 
administrative receiver or similar officer for it or for all or any 
material part of its property; or any receiver, trustee, custodian, 
conservator, liquidator, rehabilitator, administrator, administrative 
receiver or similar officer is appointed without the application or consent 
of such Person and the appointment continues undischarged or unstayed for 
sixty (60) calendar days; or any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law 
relating to any such Person or to all or any material part of its property 
is instituted without the consent of such Person and continues undismissed 
or unstayed for sixty (60) calendar days, or an order for relief is entered 
in any such proceeding; or
 
111
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
(g)           Inability to Pay Debts; Attachment.  Any Loan Party or any 
Subsidiary becomes unable or admits in writing its inability or fails 
generally to pay its debts as they become due, or any writ or warrant of 
attachment or execution or similar process is issued or levied against all 
or any material part of the property of the Loan Parties and the 
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and is not released, vacated or fully 
bonded within sixty (60) days after its issue or levy; or
 
(h)           Judgments.  There is entered against any Loan Party or any 
Subsidiary a final judgment or order for the payment of money in an 
aggregate amount exceeding $1,000,000 (to the extent not covered by 
independent third-party insurance as to which the insurer has been notified 
of such judgment or order and has not denied coverage thereof) and such 
judgment or order shall not have been satisfied, vacated, discharged or 
stayed or bonded pending an appeal for a period of sixty (60) consecutive 
days; or
 
(i)            ERISA.  (i) An ERISA Event occurs with respect to a Pension 
Plan or Multiemployer Plan which has resulted or would reasonably be 
expected to result in liability of any Loan Party or their respective ERISA 
Affiliates under Title IV of ERISA in an aggregate amount which would 
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect or the 
imposition of a Lien against the property of any Loan Party, or (ii) any 
Loan Party or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates fails to pay when 
due, after the expiration of any applicable grace period, any installment 
payment with respect to its Withdrawal Liability under Section 4201 of 
ERISA under a Multiemployer Plan in an aggregate amount exceeding an amount 
that could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, 
or
 
(j)            Invalidity of Loan Documents.  Any material provision of any 
Loan Document, at any time after its execution and delivery and for any 
reason other than as expressly permitted hereunder or thereunder (including 
as a result of a transaction permitted under Section 7.04 or 7.05) or the 
satisfaction in full of all the Obligations, ceases to be in full force and 
effect; or any Loan Party contests in writing the validity or 
enforceability of any provision of any Loan Document; or any Loan Party 
denies in writing that it has any or further liability or obligation under 
any Loan Document (other than as a result of repayment in full of the 
Obligations), or purports in writing to revoke or rescind any Loan 
Document; or
 
(k)           Collateral Documents.  Any Collateral Document after delivery 
thereof pursuant to Section 4.01 or 6.11 shall for any reason (other than 
pursuant to the terms hereof or thereof including as a result of a 
transaction permitted under Section 7.04 or 7.05) ceases to create, or any 
Lien purported to be created by any Collateral Document shall be asserted 
in writing by any Person not to be, a valid and perfected lien, with the 
priority required by the Collateral Documents (or other security purported 
to be created on the applicable Collateral) on and security interest in the 
Collateral purported to be covered thereby, subject to Liens permitted 
under Section 7.01, other than as a result of the Administrative Agent or 
Collateral Agent failing to properly file Uniform Commercial Code financing 
statements or continuation statements necessary to maintain perfection; or
 
(l)            Change of Control.  There occurs any Change of Control; or
 
(m)          Subordinated Debt.  The Subordinated Debt or the guarantees 
thereof shall cease, for any reason, to be validly subordinated to the 
Obligations of the Loan Parties hereunder, as
 
112
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
provided in the Subordinated Loan Agreement and/or in the Subordination 
Agreement, or any Loan Party, any Affiliate of any Loan Party, or any 
holder of the Subordinated Debt shall so assert.
 
Section 8.02.         Remedies upon Event of Default.  If any Event of 
Default occurs and is continuing, the Administrative Agent may with the 
consent of, and shall at the request of, the Required Lenders take any or 
all of the following actions;
 
(a)           declare the Commitments of each Lender to be terminated, 
whereupon such Commitments and obligation shall be terminated;
 
(b)           declare the unpaid principal amount of all outstanding Loans, 
all interest accrued and unpaid thereon, and all other amounts owing or 
payable hereunder or under any other Loan Document to be immediately due 
and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any 
kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by each Borrower and each 
other Loan Party;
 
(c)           require that the Borrowers Cash Collateralize the LC Exposure 
(in an amount equal to the then outstanding amount thereof); and
 
(d)           exercise on behalf of itself and the Lenders all rights and 
remedies available to it and the Lenders under the Loan Documents or 
applicable Law;
 
provided that upon the occurrence of an actual or deemed entry of an order 
for relief with respect to any Borrower under the Bankruptcy Code of the 
United States, the Commitments of each Lender shall automatically 
terminate, the unpaid principal amount of all outstanding Loans and all 
interest and other amounts as aforesaid shall automatically become due and 
payable, in each case without further act of the Administrative Agent or 
any Lender.
 
Section 8.03.         Application of Funds.  After the exercise of remedies 
provided for in Section 8.02 (or after the Loans have automatically become 
immediately due and payable as set forth in the proviso to Section 8.02), 
any amounts received on account of the Obligations shall be applied by the 
Administrative Agent in the following order:
 
    First, to payment of that portion of the Obligations constituting fees,
    indemnities, expenses and other amounts (other than principal and
    interest, but including Attorney Costs payable under Section 10.04 and
    amounts payable under Article III) payable to the Administrative Agent
    or the Collateral Agent in its capacity as such;
     
    Second, to payment of that portion of the Obligations constituting
    fees, indemnities and other amounts (other than principal and interest)
    payable to the Lenders (including Attorney Costs payable under Section
    10.04 and amounts payable under Article III) ratably among them in
    proportion to the amounts described in this clause Second payable to
    them;
     
    Third, to payment of that portion of the Obligations constituting
    accrued and unpaid interest on the Loans, ratably among the Lenders in
    proportion to the respective amounts described in this clause Third
    payable to them;
 
113
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
    Fourth, to payment of that portion of the Obligations constituting
    unpaid principal of the Loans, the Obligations under Secured Hedge
    Agreements and Cash Management Obligations, ratably among the Secured
    Parties in proportion to the respective amounts described in this
    clause Fourth held by them;
     
    Fifth, to the payment of all other Obligations of the Loan Parties that
    are due and payable to the Administrative Agent and the other Secured
    Parties on such date, ratably based upon the respective aggregate
    amounts of all such Obligations owing to the Administrative Agent and
    the other Secured Parties on such date; and
     
    Last, the balance, if any, after all of the Obligations have been
    indefeasibly paid in full, to the Borrowers or as otherwise required by
    Law.
     
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Obligations arising under Secured Hedge 
Agreements shall be excluded from the application described above if the 
Administrative Agent has not received written notice thereof, together with 
such supporting documentation as the Administrative Agent may request, from 
the applicable Hedge Bank (other than Citizens or its Affiliates), as the 
case may be.  Each Hedge Bank not a party to this Agreement that has given 
the notice contemplated by the preceding sentence shall, by such notice, be 
deemed to have acknowledged and accepted the appointment of the 
Administrative Agent pursuant to the terms of Article IX for itself and its 
Affiliates as if a Lender party hereto.  Excluded Swap Obligations with 
respect to any Loan Party shall not be paid with amounts received from such 
Loan Party or its assets, but appropriate adjustments shall be made with 
respect to payments from the Borrower or the other Loan Parties, as 
applicable, to preserve the allocation to Obligations otherwise set forth 
above in this Section 8.03.
 
Section 8.04.         Equity Cure.   Notwithstanding anything to the 
contrary contained in this Article 8, if the Borrowers fail to comply with 
the requirement of any financial covenants set forth in Section 7.14, the 
Borrowers shall have the right to cure such failure (the Cure Right), by 
notice to the Administrative Agent not later than the date on which the 
applicable Compliance Certificate is required to be delivered pursuant to 
Section 6.01 for the period for which such financial covenants are being 
measured, to cause the net cash proceeds of an issuance of Equity Interests 
(other than Disqualified Equity Interests) by the Parent to be contributed 
in cash to the common equity to a Borrower, all not later than the tenth 
Business Day following the date of such notice and upon receipt by such 
Borrower of such cash contribution (such cash amount actually received by 
the Borrowers being referred to as the Cure Amount) pursuant to the 
exercise of such Cure Right, each such financial covenant shall be 
recalculated giving effect to the following pro forma adjustments:
 
(a)           Consolidated EBITDA shall be deemed to be increased, solely 
for the purpose of calculation of the financial covenants set forth in 
Section 7.14 with respect to any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters 
that includes the fiscal quarter for which the Cure Right was exercised and 
not for any other purpose under this Agreement, by an amount equal to the 
Cure Amount; and
 
(b)           if, after giving effect to the foregoing recalculations, the 
Borrowers shall then be in compliance with the requirements of the 
financial covenants set forth in Section 7.14, the
 
114
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Borrowers shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirements of the 
financial covenants set forth in Section 7.14 as of the relevant date of 
determination with the same effect as though there had been no failure to 
comply therewith at such date, and the applicable breach or default of such 
financial covenants that had occurred shall be deemed cured for the 
purposes of this Agreement; provided that (i) Cure Rights shall not be 
exercised in more than two consecutive fiscal quarters, (ii) there shall be 
a maximum of two Cure Rights exercised in any period of four consecutive 
fiscal quarters, and a maximum of four Cure Rights exercised during the 
term of this Agreement, (iii) each Cure Amount shall be no greater than the 
amount required to cause the Borrowers to be in compliance with the 
financial covenants set forth in Section 7.14; (iv) each Cure Amount may 
not exceed $3,000,000 and the aggregate amount of all Cure Rights exercised 
during the term of this Agreement may not exceed $6,000,000; (v) all Cure 
Amounts shall be disregarded for the purposes of any financial ratio 
determination under the Loan Documents other than for determining 
compliance with Section 7.14; (vi) 100% of the aggregate Net Cash Proceeds 
of such Cure Amount shall be applied as a mandatory prepayment of the Loans 
in accordance with Section 2.03(b)(iv) hereof; and (vii) no Lender or 
Issuing Bank shall be required to make any extension of credit hereunder 
during the 10 Business Days period referred to above.
 
ARTICLE IX.
 
Administrative Agent and Other Agents
 
Section 9.01.         Appointment and Authority of the Administrative Agent
.
 
(a)           Each Lender hereby irrevocably appoints Citizens to act on 
its behalf as the Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan 
Documents and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on 
its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the 
Administrative Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together with such 
actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.  The provisions of 
this Article IX (other than Sections 9.09 and 9.11) are solely for the 
benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and the Borrowers 
shall not have rights as a third party beneficiary of any such provision.  
This Agreement does not give rise now or in the future to an agency or 
partnership relationship between any Borrower and any Agent or any of their 
respective Affiliates.
 
(b)           The Administrative Agent shall also act as the collateral 
agent under the Loan Documents, and each of the Lenders (including in its 
capacities as a Lender and a potential Cash Management Bank and Hedge Bank) 
hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent to act 
as the agent of (and to hold any security interest created by the 
Collateral Documents for and on behalf of or in trust for) such Lender for 
purposes of acquiring, holding and enforcing any and all Liens on 
Collateral granted by any of the Loan Parties to secure any of the 
Obligations, together with such powers and discretion as are reasonably 
incidental thereto.  In this connection, the Administrative Agent, as 
collateral agent (and any co-agents, sub-agents and attorneys-in-fact 
appointed by the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 9.05 for purposes 
of holding or enforcing any Lien on the Collateral (or any portion thereof) 
granted under the Collateral Documents, or for exercising any rights and 
remedies thereunder at the direction of the Administrative Agent), shall be 
entitled to the benefits of all provisions of this Article IX (including 
Section 9.07, as though such co-agents, sub-agents and attorneys-in-fact 
were the collateral agent under the Loan Documents) as if set forth in 
full
 
115
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
herein with respect thereto.  Without limiting the generality of the 
foregoing, the Lenders hereby expressly authorize the Administrative Agent 
to execute any and all documents (including releases) with respect to the 
Collateral and the rights of the Secured Parties with respect thereto, as 
contemplated by and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and 
the Collateral Documents and acknowledge and agree that any such action by 
any Agent shall bind the Lenders.
 
Section 9.02.         Rights as a Lender.  Any Person serving as an Agent 
(including as Administrative Agent) hereunder shall have the same rights 
and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise 
the same as though it were not an Agent and the term Lender or Lenders 
shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise 
requires, include each Person serving as an Agent hereunder in its 
individual capacity.  Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits 
from, lend money to, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory 
capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with any Borrower 
or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not an 
Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders.  
The Lenders acknowledge that, pursuant to such activities, any Agent or its 
Affiliates may receive information regarding any Loan Party or any of its 
Affiliates (including information that may be subject to confidentiality 
obligations in favor of such Loan Party or such Affiliate) and acknowledge 
that no Agent shall be under any obligation to provide such information to 
them.
 
Section 9.03.         Exculpatory Provisions.  Neither the Administrative 
Agent nor any other Agent shall have any duties or obligations except those 
expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents.  Without 
limiting the generality of the foregoing, an Agent (including the 
Administrative Agent):
 
(a)           shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied 
duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing and 
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the use of the term 
agent herein and in the other Loan Documents with reference to any Agent 
is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) 
obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable Law and 
instead, such term is used merely as a matter of market custom, and is 
intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between 
independent contracting parties;
 
(b)           shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or 
exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers 
expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that such 
Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required 
Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be 
expressly provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents), provided 
that no Agent shall be required to take any action that, in its opinion or 
the opinion of its counsel, may expose such Agent to liability or that is 
contrary to any Loan Document or applicable law; and
 
(c)           shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the 
other Loan Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable 
for the failure to disclose, any information relating to any Borrower or 
any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by any Person 
serving as an Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.
 
116
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not 
taken by it (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders 
(or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, 
or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith shall be 
necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Sections 10.01 and 8.02) 
or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct as 
determined by the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, in 
connection with its duties expressly set forth herein.  The Administrative 
Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until 
notice describing such Default is given to the Administrative Agent by a 
Borrower or a Lender.
 
No Agent-Related Person shall be responsible for or have any duty to 
ascertain or inquire into (i) any recital, statement, warranty or 
representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other 
Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other 
document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or 
therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, 
agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the 
occurrence of any Default (including, without limitation, compliance with 
the terms and conditions of Section 10.07(h)(iii)), (iv) the validity, 
enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other 
Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, or the 
creation, perfection or priority of any Lien purported to be created by the 
Collateral Documents, (v) the value or the sufficiency of any Collateral, 
or (vi) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or 
elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required 
to be delivered to the Administrative Agent, or to inspect the properties, 
books or records of any Loan Party or any Affiliate thereof.
 
Section 9.04.         Reliance by the Administrative Agent.
 
The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not 
incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, 
consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any 
electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other 
distribution) believed by it in the absence of bad faith to be genuine and 
to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person.  
The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally 
or by telephone and believed by it in the absence of bad faith to have been 
made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying 
thereon.  In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the 
making of a Loan that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of 
a Lender, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is 
satisfactory to such Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have 
received notice to the contrary from such Lender prior to the making of 
such Loan.  The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel 
(including counsel acting for the Borrowers), independent accountants and 
other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken 
or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, 
accountants or experts.
 
The Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to 
take any action under any Loan Document unless it shall first receive such 
advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders as it deems appropriate and, 
if it so requests, it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the 
Lenders against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by 
it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action.  The 
Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in 
refraining from acting, under this Agreement or any other
 
117
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Loan Document in accordance with a request or consent of the Required 
Lenders (or such greater number of Lenders as may be expressly required 
hereby in any instance) and such request and any action taken or failure to 
act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the Lenders; provided that 
the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in 
its opinion or in the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Administrative 
Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable 
Law.
 
Section 9.05.         Delegation of Duties.  The Administrative Agent may 
perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers 
hereunder or under any other Loan Documents by or through any one or more 
sub agents appointed by the Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent 
and any such sub agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise 
its rights and powers by or through their respective Agent-Related Persons. 
 The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any such sub 
agent and to the Agent-Related Persons of the Administrative Agent and any 
such sub agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in 
connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for 
herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.
 
Section 9.06.         Non-Reliance of Administrative Agent and Other 
Lenders; Disclosure of Information by Agents.  Each Lender acknowledges 
that no Agent-Related Person has made any representation or warranty to it, 
and that no act by any Agent hereafter taken, including any consent to and 
acceptance of any assignment or review of the affairs of any Loan Party or 
any Affiliate thereof, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or 
warranty by any Agent-Related Person to any Lender as to any matter, 
including whether Agent-Related Persons have disclosed material information 
in their possession.  Each Lender represents to each Agent that it has, 
independently and without reliance upon any Agent-Related Person and based 
on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its 
own appraisal of, and investigation into the business, prospects, 
operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of 
the Loan Parties and their respective Subsidiaries, and all applicable bank 
or other regulatory Laws relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, 
and made its own decision to enter into this Agreement and to extend credit 
to the Borrowers and the other Loan Parties hereunder.  Each Lender also 
represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon any 
Agent-Related Person and based on such documents and information as it 
shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit 
analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under 
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to make such 
investigations as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, 
prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and 
creditworthiness of the Borrowers and the other Loan Parties.  Except for 
notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to 
the Lenders by any Agent herein, such Agent shall not have any duty or 
responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information 
concerning the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and 
other condition or creditworthiness of any of the Loan Parties or any of 
their respective Affiliates which may come into the possession of any 
Agent-Related Person.
 
Section 9.07.         Indemnification of Agents.  Whether or not the 
transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, the Lenders shall 
indemnify upon demand the Administrative Agent and each other Agent-Related 
Person (solely to the extent any such Agent-Related Person was performing 
services on behalf of the Administrative Agent) (to the extent not 
reimbursed by or on behalf of any Loan Party and without limiting the 
obligation of any Loan Party to do so), pro
 
118
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
rata, and hold harmless the Administrative Agent and each other 
Agent-Related Person (solely to the extent any such Agent-Related Person 
was performing services on behalf of the Administrative Agent) from and 
against any and all Indemnified Liabilities incurred by it; provided that 
no Lender shall be liable for the payment to any Agent-Related Person of 
any portion of such Indemnified Liabilities resulting from such 
Agent-Related Persons own gross negligence or willful misconduct, as 
determined by the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction; 
provided that no action taken in accordance with the directions of the 
Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as 
shall be required by the Loan Documents) shall be deemed to constitute 
gross negligence or willful misconduct for purposes of this Section 9.07.  
In the case of any investigation, litigation or proceeding giving rise to 
any Indemnified Liabilities, this Section 9.07 applies whether any such 
investigation, litigation or proceeding is brought by any Lender or any 
other Person.  Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender shall 
reimburse the Administrative Agent upon demand for its ratable share of any 
costs or out-of-pocket expenses (including Attorney Costs) incurred by the 
Administrative Agent in connection with the preparation, execution, 
delivery, administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether 
through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice 
in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement, any other 
Loan Document, or any document contemplated by or referred to herein, to 
the extent that the Administrative Agent is not reimbursed for such 
expenses by or on behalf of the Borrowers, provided that such reimbursement 
by the Lenders shall not affect the Borrowers continuing reimbursement 
obligations with respect thereto, provided, further, that the failure of 
any Lender to indemnify or reimburse the Administrative Agent shall not 
relieve any other Lender of its obligation in respect thereof.  The 
undertaking in this Section 9.07 shall survive termination of the Aggregate 
Commitments, the payment of all other Obligations and the resignation of 
the Administrative Agent.
 
Section 9.08.         No Other Duties; Other Agents, Arranger, Manners, etc
.  Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, neither the Arranger 
nor the other Agents shall have any powers, duties or responsibilities 
under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, except in its 
capacity, as applicable, as the Administrative Agent or a Lender hereunder 
and such Persons shall have the benefit of this Article IX and none of the 
Arranger or Syndication Agent listed on the cover page hereof shall have 
any powers, duties or responsibilities under this Agreement or any of the 
other Loan Documents, except in its capacity, as applicable, as the 
Administrative Agent, a Lender or the Issuing Bank hereunder.  Without 
limiting the foregoing, none of the Lenders or other Persons so identified 
shall have or be deemed to have any agency or fiduciary or trust 
relationship with any Lender, the Parent, any Borrower or any of their 
respective Subsidiaries.  Each Lender acknowledges that it has not relied, 
and will not rely, on any of the Lenders or other Persons so identified in 
deciding to enter into this Agreement or in taking or not taking action 
hereunder.  The Syndication Agent, without consent of or notice to any 
party hereto, may assign any and all of its rights or obligations hereunder 
to any of its Affiliates.  The Syndication Agent may resign from such role 
at any time, with immediate effect, by giving prior written notice thereof 
to the Administrative Agent or the Borrowers.
 
Section 9.09.         Resignation of Administrative Agent or Collateral 
Agent.   The Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent may at any time give 
notice of its resignation to the Lenders and the Borrowers.  Upon receipt 
of any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the 
right, with the consent of the Borrowers at all times other than during the
 
119
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
existence of an Event of Default (which consent of the Borrowers shall not 
be unreasonably withheld or delayed), to appoint a successor, which shall 
be a Lender or a bank with an office in the United States, or an Affiliate 
of any such Lender or bank with an office in the United States.  If no such 
successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall 
have accepted such appointment within thirty (30) days after the retiring 
Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as applicable, gives notice of 
its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent or Collateral 
Agent, as applicable, may on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor 
Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as applicable, meeting the 
qualifications set forth above; provided that if the Administrative Agent 
or Collateral Agent, as applicable, shall notify the Borrowers and the 
Lenders that no qualifying Person has accepted such appointment, then such 
resignation shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such 
notice and (a) the retiring Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as 
applicable, shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder 
and under the other Loan Documents (except that in the case of any 
collateral security held by the Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent on 
behalf of the Lenders under any of the Loan Documents, the retiring Agent 
shall continue to hold such collateral security until such time as a 
successor of such Agent is appointed) and (b) all payments, communications 
and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative 
Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender directly, until such time 
as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as 
provided for above in this Section.  Upon the acceptance of a successors 
appointment as Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as applicable, 
hereunder and upon the execution and filing or recording of such financing 
statements, or amendments thereto, and such amendments or supplements to 
the Mortgages, and such other instruments or notices, as may be necessary 
or desirable, or as the Required Lenders may request, in order to (i) 
continue the perfection of the Liens granted or purported to be granted by 
the Collateral Documents or (ii) otherwise ensure that the Collateral and 
Guarantee Requirement is satisfied, such successor shall succeed to and 
become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the 
retiring (or retired) Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as 
applicable, and the retiring Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as 
applicable, shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations 
hereunder or under the other Loan Documents (if not already discharged 
therefrom as provided above in this Section).  After the retiring Agents 
resignation hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of 
this Article and Sections 10.04 and 10.05 shall continue in effect for the 
benefit of such retiring Agent, its sub-agents and their respective 
Agent-Related Persons in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be 
taken by any of them while the retiring Agent was acting as Administrative 
Agent or Collateral Agent, as applicable.
 
Section 9.10.         Administrative Agent May File Proofs of Claim.  In 
case of the pendency of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or any 
other judicial proceeding relative to any Loan Party, the Administrative 
Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan shall then be due 
and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and 
irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand 
on the Borrowers) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such 
proceeding or otherwise:
 
(a)           to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the 
principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans, and all 
other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other 
documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of 
the Lenders and the Administrative Agent (including any claim for the 
reasonable compensation,
 
120
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
expenses, disbursements and advances of the Lenders and the Administrative 
Agent and their respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due the 
Lenders and the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.07 and 10.04) allowed 
in such judicial proceeding; and
 
(b)           to collect and receive any monies or other property payable 
or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;
 
and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or 
other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized 
by each Lender to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in 
the event that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such 
payments directly to the Lenders, to pay to the Administrative Agent any 
amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and 
advances of the Agents and their respective agents and counsel, and any 
other amounts due the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.07 and 10.04.
 
Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative 
Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender 
any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition 
affecting the Obligations or the rights of any Lender or to authorize the 
Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender in any 
such proceeding.
 
Section 9.11.         Collateral and Guaranty Matters.  Each of the Lenders 
(including in its capacities as a potential Cash Management Bank and Hedge 
Bank) irrevocably authorizes the Administrative Agent and the Collateral 
Agent, and each of the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent agrees 
that it will:
 
(a)           release any Lien on any property granted to or held by the 
Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent under any Loan Document (i) 
upon termination of the Aggregate Commitments and payment in full of all 
Obligations (other than (x) obligations and liabilities under Secured Hedge 
Agreements as to which arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the 
applicable Hedge Bank shall have been made, (y) contingent indemnification 
obligations not yet accrued and payable and (z) Cash Management 
Obligations), (ii) at the time the property subject to such Lien is 
transferred or to be transferred as part of or in connection with any 
transfer permitted hereunder or under any other Loan Document to any Person 
other than a Borrower or any of its Domestic Subsidiaries that are 
Guarantors, (iii) subject to Section 10.01, if the release of such Lien is 
approved, authorized or ratified in writing by the Required Lenders, or 
(iv) if the property subject to such Lien is owned by a Guarantor, upon 
release of such Guarantor from its obligations under the Guarantee and 
Collateral Agreement pursuant to clause (c) below;
 
(b)           release or subordinate any Lien on any property granted to or 
held by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent under any Loan 
Document to the holder of any Lien on such property that is permitted by 
Section 7.01(d);
 
(c)           release any Guarantor from its obligations under the 
Guarantee and Collateral Agreement if such Person ceases to be a Subsidiary 
as a result of a transaction or designation permitted hereunder; and 
release any Liens granted by such Subsidiary or Liens on the Equity 
Interests of such Subsidiary; provided that no such release shall occur if 
such Guarantor
 
121
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
continues to be a guarantor in respect of any Indebtedness (other than the 
Obligations) of any Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries.
 
Upon request by the Administrative Agent at any time, the Required Lenders 
will confirm in writing the Collateral Agents authority to release or 
subordinate its interest in particular types or items of property, or to 
release any Guarantor from its obligations under the Guarantee and 
Collateral Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.11.  In each case as 
specified in this Section 9.11, the applicable Agent will (and each Lender 
irrevocably authorizes the applicable Agent to), at the Borrowers expense, 
execute and deliver to the applicable Loan Party such documents as such 
Loan Party may reasonably request to evidence the release or subordination 
of such item of Collateral from the assignment and security interest 
granted under the Collateral Documents, or to evidence the release of such 
Guarantor from its obligations under the Guarantee and Collateral 
Agreement, in each case in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents 
and this Section 9.11.
 
Section 9.12.         Appointment of Supplemental Administrative Agents.
 
(a)           It is the purpose of this Agreement and the other Loan 
Documents that there shall be no violation of any Law of any jurisdiction 
denying or restricting the right of banking corporations or associations to 
transact business as agent or trustee in such jurisdiction.  It is 
recognized that in case of litigation under this Agreement or any of the 
other Loan Documents, and in particular in case of the enforcement of any 
of the Loan Documents, or in case the Administrative Agent deems that by 
reason of any present or future Law of any jurisdiction it may not exercise 
any of the rights, powers or remedies granted herein or in any of the other 
Loan Documents or take any other action which may be desirable or necessary 
in connection therewith, the Administrative Agent is hereby authorized to 
appoint an additional individual or institution selected by the 
Administrative Agent in its sole discretion as a separate trustee, co- 
trustee, administrative agent, collateral agent, administrative sub-agent 
or administrative co- agent (any such additional individual or institution 
being referred to herein individually as a Supplemental Administrative 
Agent and collectively as Supplemental Administrative Agents).
 
(b)           In the event that the Administrative Agent appoints a 
Supplemental Administrative Agent with respect to any Collateral, (i) each 
and every right, power, privilege or duty expressed or intended by this 
Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents to be exercised by or vested 
in or conveyed to the Administrative Agent with respect to such Collateral 
shall be exercisable by and vest in such Supplemental Administrative Agent 
to the extent, and only to the extent, necessary to enable such 
Supplemental Administrative Agent to exercise such rights, powers and 
privileges with respect to such Collateral and to perform such duties with 
respect to such Collateral, and every covenant and obligation contained in 
the Loan Documents and necessary to the exercise or performance thereof by 
such Supplemental Administrative Agent shall run to and be enforceable by 
either the Administrative Agent or such Supplemental Administrative Agent, 
and (ii) the provisions of this Article IX and of Sections 10.04 and 10.05 
that refer to the Administrative Agent shall inure to the benefit of such 
Supplemental Administrative Agent and all references therein to the 
Administrative Agent shall be deemed to be references to the Administrative 
Agent and/or such Supplemental Administrative Agent, as the context may 
require.
 
122
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
(c)           Should any instrument in writing from any Loan Party be 
required by any Supplemental Administrative Agent so appointed by the 
Administrative Agent for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming 
to him or it such rights, powers, privileges and duties, the Borrowers 
shall, or shall cause such Loan Party to, execute, acknowledge and deliver 
any and all such instruments promptly upon request by the Administrative 
Agent.  In case any Supplemental Administrative Agent, or a successor 
thereto, shall die, become incapable of acting, resign or be removed, all 
the rights, powers, privileges and duties of such Supplemental 
Administrative Agent, to the extent permitted by Law, shall vest in and be 
exercised by the Administrative Agent until the appointment of a new 
Supplemental Administrative Agent.
 
Section 9.13.         Other Secured Obligations.  Except as otherwise 
expressly set forth herein or in the Collateral Documents, no Hedge Bank or 
Cash Management Bank that obtains the benefits of Section 8.03, the 
guarantee under the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement or any Collateral by 
virtue of the provisions hereof or of any Collateral Document shall have 
any right to notice of any action or to consent to, direct or object to any 
action hereunder or under any other Loan Document or otherwise in respect 
of the Collateral (including the release or impairment of any Collateral) 
other than in its capacity as a Lender and, in such case, only to the 
extent expressly provided in the Loan Documents.  Notwithstanding any other 
provision of this Article IX to the contrary, the Administrative Agent 
shall not be required to verify the payment of, or that other satisfactory 
arrangements have been made with respect to, Obligations arising under 
Secured Hedge Agreements or Cash Management Obligations unless the 
Administrative Agent has received written notice of such Obligations, 
together with such supporting documentation as the Administrative Agent may 
request, from the applicable Hedge Bank or Cash Management Bank.
 
ARTICLE X.
 
Miscellaneous
 
Section 10.01.      Amendments, etc.  Except as otherwise set forth in this 
Agreement, no amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any 
other Loan Document, and no consent to any departure by the Parent or any 
other Loan Party therefrom, shall be effective unless in writing signed by 
the Required Lenders and the Parent or the applicable Loan Party, as the 
case may be, and each such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the 
specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given; provided 
that, no such amendment, waiver or consent shall:
 
(a)           extend or increase the Commitment of any Lender without the 
written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby (it being 
understood that a waiver of any condition precedent set forth in Section 
4.02 or the waiver of any Default, mandatory prepayment or mandatory 
reduction of the Commitments shall not constitute an extension or increase 
of any Commitment of any Lender);
 
(b)           postpone any date scheduled for, or reduce the amount of, any 
payment of principal or interest under Section 2.05 or 2.06 without the 
written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby, it being 
understood that the waiver of (or amendment to the terms of)
 
123
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
any mandatory prepayment of the Loans shall not constitute a postponement 
of any date scheduled for the payment of principal or interest;
 
(c)           reduce the principal of, or the rate of interest specified 
herein on, any Loan, or (subject to clause (i) of the second proviso to 
this Section 10.01) any fees or other amounts payable hereunder or under 
any other Loan Document without the written consent of each Lender directly 
affected thereby; provided that only the consent of the Required Lenders 
shall be necessary to amend the definition of Default Rate or to waive 
any obligation of the Borrowers to pay interest at the Default Rate;
 
(d)           change any provision of this Section 10.01 or the definition 
of Required Lenders, Required Facility Lenders or Pro Rata Share or 
any other provision specifying the number of Lenders or portion of the 
Loans or Commitments required to take any action under the Loan Documents, 
without the written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby (other 
than any Defaulting Lender);
 
(e)           other than in a transaction permitted under Section 7.04 or 
Section 7.05, release all or substantially all of the Collateral in any 
transaction or series of related transactions, without the written consent 
of each Lender (other than any Defaulting Lender); or
 
(f)            other than in a transaction permitted under Section 7.04 or 
Section 7.05, release any material Guarantor, without the written consent 
of each Lender (other than any Defaulting Lender);
 
and provided, further, that (i) no amendment, waiver or consent shall, 
unless in writing and signed by the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank 
or the Swingline Lender in addition to the Lenders required above, affect 
the rights or duties of, or any fees or other amounts payable to, the 
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, as the case 
may be, under this Agreement or any other Loan Document; and (ii) the 
consent of the Required Facility Lenders for the adversely affected Credit 
Facility shall be required with respect to any amendment that by its terms 
adversely affects the rights of Lenders under such Credit Facility in 
respect of payments hereunder in a manner different than such amendment 
affects other Credit Facilities.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing,
 
(g)           the Fee Letter may be amended by the parties thereto; and
 
(h)           this Agreement may be amended (or amended and restated) with 
the written consent of the Required Lenders, the Administrative Agent and 
the Borrowers (i) to add one or more additional credit facilities to this 
Agreement and to permit the extensions of credit from time to time 
outstanding thereunder and the accrued interest and fees in respect thereof 
to share ratably in the benefits of this Agreement and the other Loan 
Documents with the Loans and the accrued interest and fees in respect 
thereof and (ii) to include appropriately the Lenders holding such credit 
facilities in any determination of the Required Lenders.
 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 10.01, 
guarantees, collateral security documents and related documents executed by 
Loan Parties in connection with
 
124
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
this Agreement may be in a form reasonably determined by the Administrative 
Agent and may be, together with this Agreement, amended and Lenders rights 
thereunder waived with the consent of the Administrative Agent at the 
request of the Borrowers without the need to obtain the consent of any 
other Lender if such amendment or waiver is delivered in order (i) to 
comply with local Law or advice of local counsel, (ii) to cure ambiguities 
or defects or (iii) to cause such guarantee, collateral security document 
or other document to be consistent with this Agreement and the other Loan 
Documents.
 
Section 10.02.      Notices and Other Communications; Facsimile Copies.
 
(a)           General.  Except in the case of notices and other 
communications expressly permitted to be given by telephone (and except as

overnight courier service, mailed by certified or registered mail or sent 
by telecopier or electronic mail as follows, and all notices and other 
communications expressly permitted hereunder to be given by telephone shall 
be made to the applicable telephone number, as follows:
 
    (i)            if to the Parent, any Borrower or the Administrative
    Agent, to the address, telecopier number, electronic mail address or

    (ii)           if to any other Lender, to the address, telecopier
    number, electronic mail address or telephone number specified in its
    Administrative Questionnaire.
     
Notices and other communications sent by hand or overnight courier service, 
or mailed by certified or registered mail, shall be deemed to have been 
given when received; notices and other communications sent by telecopier 
shall be deemed to have been given when sent (except that, if not given

communications to the extent provided in subsection (b) below shall be 
effective as provided in such subsection (b).
 
(b)           Electronic Communication.  Notices and other communications 
to the Lenders hereunder may be delivered or furnished by electronic 
communication (including e-mail and Internet or intranet websites) pursuant 
to procedures approved by the Administrative Agent, provided that the 
foregoing shall not apply to notices to any Lender pursuant to Article II 
if such Lender, as applicable, has notified the Administrative Agent that 
it is incapable of receiving notices under such Article by electronic 
communication.  The Administrative Agent, the Parent or any Borrower may, 
in its discretion, agree to accept notices and other communications to it 
hereunder by electronic communications pursuant to procedures approved by 
it, provided that approval of such procedures may be limited to particular 
notices or communications.
 
(c)           Unless the Administrative Agent otherwise prescribes, (i) 
notices and other communications sent to an e-mail address shall be deemed 
received upon the senders receipt of an acknowledgement from the intended 
recipient (such as by the return receipt requested function, as 
available, return e-mail or other written acknowledgement), provided that 
if such notice or other communication is not sent during the normal 
business hours of the recipient, such
 
125
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
notice or communication shall be deemed to have been sent at the opening of 
business on the next Business Day for the recipient, and (ii) notices or 
communications posted to an Internet or intranet website shall be deemed 
received upon the deemed receipt by the intended recipient at its e-mail 
address as described in the foregoing clause (i) of notification that such 
notice or communication is available and identifying the website address 
therefor.
 
(d)           The Platform.  THE PLATFORM IS PROVIDED AS IS AND AS 
AVAILABLE.  THE AGENT PARTIES (AS DEFINED BELOW) DO NOT WARRANT THE 
ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF THE BORROWER MATERIALS OR THE ADEQUACY OF THE 
PLATFORM, AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM LIABILITY FOR ERRORS IN OR OMISSIONS FROM 
THE BORROWER MATERIALS.  NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR 
STATUTORY, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A 
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON- INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS OR FREEDOM FROM 
VIRUSES OR OTHER CODE DEFECTS, IS MADE BY ANY AGENT PARTY IN CONNECTION 
WITH THE BORROWER MATERIALS OR THE PLATFORM.  In no event shall the 
Administrative Agent or any of its Agent-Related Persons or the Arranger 
(collectively, the Agent Parties) have any liability to the Parent, any 
Borrower, any Lender, or any other Person for losses, claims, damages, 
liabilities or expenses of any kind (whether in tort, contract or 
otherwise) arising out of the Borrowers or the Administrative Agents 
transmission of Borrower Materials through the Internet, except to the 
extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses are 
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by a final and 
nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the bad faith, gross 
negligence or willful misconduct of such Agent Party; provided, however, 
that in no event shall any Agent Party have any liability to the Parent, 
any Borrower, any Lender or any other Person for indirect, special, 
incidental, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or 
actual damages).
 
(e)           Change of Address.  Each of the Parent, the Borrowers and the 
Administrative Agent may change its address, telecopier or telephone number 
for notices and other communications hereunder by notice to the other 
parties hereto.  Each other Lender may change its address, telecopier or 
telephone number for notices and other communications hereunder by notice 
to the Parent and the Administrative Agent.  In addition, each Lender 
agrees to notify the Administrative Agent from time to time to ensure that 
the Administrative Agent has on record (i) an effective address, contact 
name, telephone number, telecopier number and electronic mail address to 
which notices and other communications may be sent and (ii) accurate wire 
instructions for such Lender.  Furthermore, each Public Lender agrees to 
cause at least one individual at or on behalf of such Public Lender to at 
all times have selected the Private Side Information or similar 
designation on the content declaration screen of the Platform in order to 
enable such Public Lender or its delegate, in accordance with such Public 
Lenders compliance procedures and applicable Law, including United States 
Federal and state securities Laws, to make reference to Borrower Materials 
that are not made available through the Public Side Information portion 
of the Platform and that may contain material non-public information with 
respect to the Borrowers or their securities for purposes of United States 
Federal or state securities laws.
 
(f)            Reliance by the Administrative Agent.  The Administrative 
Agent and the Lenders shall be entitled to rely and act upon any notices 
purportedly given by or on behalf of
 
126
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
the Parent or any Borrower even if (i) such notices were not made in a 
manner specified herein, were incomplete or were not preceded or followed 
by any other form of notice specified herein, or (ii) the terms thereof, as 
understood by the recipient, varied from any confirmation thereof.  The 
Borrowers shall indemnify the Administrative Agent each Lender and the 
Agent-Related Persons of each of them from all losses, costs, expenses and 
liabilities resulting from the reliance in the absence of bad faith by such 
Person on each notice purportedly given by or on behalf of the Parent or 
any Borrower.  All telephonic notices to and other telephonic 
communications with the Administrative Agent may be recorded by the 
Administrative Agent, and each of the parties hereto hereby consents to 
such recording.
 
Section 10.03.      No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies.  No failure by any 
Lender or the Administrative Agent to exercise, and no delay by any such 
Person in exercising, any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder or 
under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall 
any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege 
hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of 
any other right, remedy, power or privilege.  The rights, remedies, powers 
and privileges herein provided, and provided under each other Loan 
Document, are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, remedies, powers 
and privileges provided by Law.
 
Section 10.04.      Attorney Costs and Expenses.  The Borrowers agree (a) 
to pay or reimburse the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the 
Syndication Agent and the Arranger for all reasonable and documented 
out-of-pocket Attorney Costs of Jones Day incurred in connection with the 
preparation, negotiation, syndication and execution of this Agreement and 
the other Loan Documents and any amendment, waiver, consent or other 
modification of the provisions hereof and thereof (whether or not the 
transactions contemplated thereby are consummated), and the consummation 
and administration of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, (b) 
to pay or reimburse the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and the 
Arranger for all reasonable and documented appraisal fees, filing and 
search charges, recording taxes and Field Examination charges and expenses 
and (b) to pay or reimburse the Administrative Agent and the Lenders for 
all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in 
connection with the monitoring or enforcement of any rights or remedies 
under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents (including all such costs 
and expenses incurred during any legal proceeding, including any proceeding 
under any Debtor Relief Law, and including all Attorney Costs of counsel to 
the Administrative Agent and the Lenders taken as a whole (and, if 
reasonably necessary, one local counsel in any relevant material 
jurisdiction).  The agreements in this Section 10.04 shall survive the 
termination of the Aggregate Commitments and repayment of all other 
Obligations.  All amounts due under this Section 10.04 shall be paid 
promptly following receipt by the Parent of an invoice relating thereto 
setting forth such expenses in reasonable detail.  If any Loan Party fails 
to pay when due any costs, expenses or other amounts payable by it 
hereunder or under any Loan Document, such amount may be paid on behalf of 
such Loan Party by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion.
 
Section 10.05.      Indemnification by the Borrowers.  The Borrowers shall 
indemnify and hold harmless the Agents, each Lender, the Arranger and their 
respective Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, partners, 
trustees or advisors and other representatives (collectively the 
Indemnitees) from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, 
claims, and expenses (including Attorney Costs) of any kind or nature 
whatsoever which may at any time be
 
127
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
imposed on, incurred by or asserted against any such Indemnitee in any way 
relating to or arising out of or in connection with (but limited, in the 
case of Attorney Costs, to the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket 
fees, disbursements and other charges of one counsel to all Indemnitees 
taken as a whole and, if reasonably necessary, a single local counsel for 
all Indemnitees taken as a whole in each relevant jurisdiction that is 
material to the interest of the Lenders) (a) the execution, delivery, 
enforcement, performance or administration of any Loan Document or any 
other agreement, letter or instrument delivered in connection with the 
transactions contemplated thereby or the consummation of the transactions 
contemplated thereby, (b) any Commitment, Loan or the use or proposed use 
of the proceeds therefrom, (c) any actual or alleged presence or release of 
Hazardous Materials on or from any property currently or formerly owned or 
operated by any Borrower, any Subsidiary or any other Loan Party, or any 
Environmental Liability related in any way to any Borrower, any Subsidiary 
or any other Loan Party or (d) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, 
investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based 
on contract, tort or any other theory (including any investigation of, 
preparation for, or defense of any pending or threatened claim, 
investigation, litigation or proceeding) and regardless of whether any 
Indemnitee is a party thereto (all the foregoing, collectively, the 
Indemnified Liabilities); provided that such indemnity shall not, as to 
any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such liabilities, losses, 
damages, claims, and expenses resulted from (y) the gross negligence or 
willful misconduct of such Indemnitee or (z) a material breach in bad faith 
of any material obligations under any Loan Document by such Indemnitee, in 
each case as determined by a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of 
competent jurisdiction.  To the extent that the undertakings to indemnify 
and hold harmless set forth in this Section 10.05 may be unenforceable in 
whole or in part because they are violative of any applicable law or public 
policy, each of the Borrowers shall contribute the maximum portion that it 
is permitted to pay and satisfy under applicable law to the payment and 
satisfaction of all Indemnified Liabilities incurred by the Indemnitees or 
any of them.  No Indemnitee shall be liable for any damages arising from 
the use by others of any information or other materials obtained through 
IntraLinks or other similar information transmission systems in connection 
with this Agreement, nor shall any Indemnitee or any Loan Party have any 
liability for any special, punitive, indirect or consequential damages 
relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or arising out of its 
activities in connection herewith or therewith (whether before or after the 
Closing Date).  In the case of an investigation, litigation or other 
proceeding to which the indemnity in this Section 10.05 applies, such 
indemnity shall be effective whether or not such investigation, litigation 
or proceeding is brought by any Loan Party, its directors, stockholders or 
creditors or an Indemnitee or any other Person, whether or not any 
Indemnitee is otherwise a party thereto and whether or not any of the 
transactions contemplated hereunder or under any of the other Loan 
Documents is consummated.  All amounts due under this Section 10.05 shall 
be paid within twenty (20) Business Days after written demand therefor.  
The agreements in this Section 10.05 shall survive the resignation of the 
Administrative Agent, the replacement of any Lender, the termination of the 
Aggregate Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all 
the other Obligations.  This Section 10.05 shall not apply with respect to 
Taxes other than any Taxes that represent losses, claims, damages, etc. 
arising from any non-Tax claim.
 
Section 10.06.      Marshaling; Payments Set Aside.  None of the 
Administrative Agent or any Lender shall be under any obligation to marshal 
any assets in favor of the Loan Parties or any other party or against or in 
payment of any or all of the Obligations.  To the extent that any payment 
by or on behalf of the Borrowers is made to any Agent or any Lender, or any 
Agent or
 
128
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
any Lender exercises its right of setoff, and such payment or the proceeds 
of such setoff or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to 
be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to 
any settlement entered into by such Agent or such Lender in its discretion) 
to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in connection with 
any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or otherwise, then (a) to the 
extent of such recovery, the obligation or part thereof originally intended 
to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as 
if such payment had not been made or such setoff had not occurred, and (b) 
each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent upon demand 
its applicable share of any amount so recovered from or repaid by any 
Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such 
payment is made at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate 
from time to time in effect.
 
Section 10.07.      Successors and Assigns.
 
(a)           The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and 
inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors 
and assigns permitted hereby, except that the Parent and the Borrowers may 
not, except as permitted by Section 7.04, assign or otherwise transfer any 
of their respective rights or obligations hereunder without the prior 
written consent of the Administrative Agent and each Lender and no Lender 
may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder 
except (i) to an assignee in accordance with the provisions of subsection 
(b) of this Section, (ii) by way of participation in accordance with the 
provisions of subsection (d) of this Section, or (iii) by way of pledge or 
assignment of a security interest subject to the restrictions of subsection 
(f) of this Section (and any other attempted assignment or transfer by any 
party hereto shall be null and void).  Nothing in this Agreement, expressed 
or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the 
parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, 
Participants to the extent provided in subsection (d) of this Section and, 
to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Agent-Related Persons of 
each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders) any legal or equitable 
right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.
 
(b)           Assignments by Lenders.  Any Lender may at any time assign to 
one or more assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under 
this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans 
at the time owing to it); provided that any such assignment shall be 
subject to the following conditions:
 
    (i)            Minimum Amounts.
     
        (A)          in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining
        amount of the assigning Lenders Commitment and the Loans at the
        time owing to it or in the case of an assignment to a Lender, an
        Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund or during the occurrence
        and continuation of an Event of Default under Section 8.01(a) or
        Section 8.01(f), no minimum amount need be assigned; and
         
        (B)          in any case not described in subsection (b)(i)(A) of
        this Section, the aggregate amount of the Commitment or, the
        principal outstanding balance of the Loans of the assigning Lender
        subject to each such assignment, determined as of the date the
        Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is
 
129
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
        delivered to the Administrative Agent or, if Trade Date is
        specified in the Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade Date,
        shall not be less than $2,000,000 unless each of the Administrative
        Agent and, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is
        continuing, the Parent otherwise consents (each such consent not to
        be unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided, however, that
        concurrent assignments to members of an Assignee Group and
        concurrent assignments from members of an Assignee Group to a
        single Eligible Assignee (or to an Eligible Assignee and members of
        its Assignee Group) will be treated as a single assignment for
        purposes of determining whether such minimum amount has been met.
 
    (ii)           Proportionate Amounts.  Each partial assignment shall be
    made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning
    Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to
    the Loans or the Commitment under the Credit Facility assigned.
     
    (iii)          Required Consents.  No consent shall be required for any
    assignment except to the extent required by subsection (b)(i)(B) of
    this Section and, in addition:
     
        (A)          the consent of the Parent (such consent not to be
        unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required unless (1) an
        Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at the time of such
        assignment or (2) such assignment is to a Lender, an Affiliate of a
        Lender or an Approved Fund;
         
        (B)          the consent of the Administrative Agent (such consent
        not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required
        unless such assignment is to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or
        an Approved Fund; and
         
        (C)          the consent of the Issuing Bank (such consent not to
        be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required for any
        assignment in respect of the Revolving Facility.
         
    (iv)          Assignment and Assumption.  The parties to each
    assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an
    Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation
    fee of $3,500 (unless such assignment is to a Lender, an Affiliate of a
    Lender or an Approved Fund) and the forms required by Section 3.01(b)
    and (c) or Section 3.01(d) as applicable; provided that the
    Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion, elect to waive such
    processing and recordation fee in the case of any assignment.  The
    Eligible Assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the
    Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire.  All assignments
    shall be by novation.
     
    (v)           No Assignments to Certain Persons.  No such assignment
    shall be made (A) to the Parent, any Borrower or any of their
    respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates or to the Permitted Holders or
    their Affiliates or (B) to a natural person.
     
Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent 
pursuant to clause (c) of this Section, from and after the effective date 
specified in each Assignment and Assumption,
 
130
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
the assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the 
extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the 
rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning 
Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such 
Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this 
Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of 
the assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement, such 
Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled 
to the benefits of Sections 3.01 (subject to the requirements thereof), 
3.04, 3.05, 10.04 and 10.05 with respect to facts and circumstances 
occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment).  Upon request, 
and the surrender by the assigning Lender of its Note, the Borrowers (at 
their expense) shall execute and deliver a Note to the assignee Lender.  
Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this 
Agreement that does not comply with this subsection shall be treated for 
purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in 
such rights and obligations in accordance with subsection (d) of this 
Section.
 
(c)           The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as a 
non-fiduciary agent of the Borrowers, shall maintain at the Administrative 
Agents Office a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and 
a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, 
and the Commitments of, and principal amounts of and related interest 
amounts on the Loans, owing to each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof 
from time to time (the Register).  The entries in the Register shall, 
subject to clause (h) of this Section, be conclusive absent manifest error, 
and the Borrowers, the Agents and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose 
name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender 
hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the 
contrary.  The Register shall be available for inspection by any Borrower, 
any Agent and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon 
reasonable prior notice.  This Section 10.07(c) and Section 2.09 shall be 
construed so that all Loans are at all times maintained in registered 
form within the meaning of Sections 163(f), 871(h)(2) and 881(c)(2) of the 
Code and any related Treasury regulations (or any other relevant or 
successor provisions of the Code or of such Treasury regulations).
 
(d)           Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice 
to, the Parent, any Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell 
participations to any Person (other than a natural person, a Borrower, the 
Permitted Holders, or any of their respective Affiliates or Subsidiaries) 
(each, a Participant) in all or a portion of such Lenders rights and/or 
obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its 
Commitment and/or the Loans owing to it); provided that (i) such Lenders 
obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender 
shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the 
performance of such obligations, and (iii) the Borrowers, the Agents and 
the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such 
Lender in connection with such Lenders rights and obligations under this 
Agreement.  Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells 
such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole 
right to enforce this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and to approve 
any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or 
any other Loan Document; provided that such agreement or instrument may 
provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, 
agree to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in the first 
proviso to Section 10.01 (other than clause (d) thereof) that directly 
affects such Participant.  Subject to subsection (e) of this Section, the 
Borrowers agree that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of 
Sections
 
131
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
3.01 (subject to the requirements of Section 3.01(b) and (c) or Section 
3.01(d), as applicable), 3.04 and 3.05 (through the applicable Lender) to 
the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by 
assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section.  To the extent 
permitted by applicable Law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the 
benefits of Section 10.09 as though it were a Lender; provided that such 
Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.11 as though it were a 
Lender.
 
(e)           Limitations upon Participant Rights.  A Participant shall not 
be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 3.01, 3.04 or 3.05 
than the participating Lender would have been entitled to receive with 
respect to the participation sold to such Participant, except to the extent 
such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Change of Law 
that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation.  
Each Lender that sells a participation shall (acting solely for this 
purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrowers) maintain a register 
complying with the requirements of Sections 163(f), 871(h) and 881(c)(2) of 
the Code and the Treasury regulations issued thereunder relating to the 
exemption from withholding for portfolio interest on which is entered the 
name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts of and 
stated interest on each Participants interest in the Loans or other 
obligations under this Agreement (the Participant Register).  A Lender 
shall not be obligated to disclose all or any portion of the Participant 
Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information 
relating to a Participants interest in any commitments, loans, letters of 
credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person 
except to the extent such disclosure is necessary to establish that any 
Loan or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of 
the United States Treasury regulations.  The entries in the Participant 
Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall 
treat each person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the 
owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement 
notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.  For the avoidance of doubt, 
the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall 
have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.
 
(f)            Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security 
interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement 
(including under its Note, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, 
including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal 
Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such 
Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee 
or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.
 
Section 10.08.      Confidentiality.  Each of the Administrative Agent and 
the Lenders agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information in 
accordance with its customary procedures (as set forth below), except that 
Information may be disclosed (a) to its Affiliates and to its and its 
Affiliates respective partners, directors, officers, employees, agents, 
trustees, advisors and representatives on a need-to-know basis (it being 
understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be 
informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to 
keep such Information confidential in accordance with this Section 10.08), 
(b) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority purporting to have 
jurisdiction over it (including any self-regulatory authority, such as the 
National Association of Insurance Commissioners), (c) to the extent 
required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar 
legal process, provided that the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as 
applicable, agrees that it will notify
 
132
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
the Parent as soon as practicable in the event of any such disclosure by 
such Person (other than at the request of a regulatory authority) unless 
such notification is prohibited by law, rule or regulation, (d) to any 
other party hereto, (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies 
hereunder or under any other Loan Document or any action or proceeding 
relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the enforcement of 
rights hereunder or thereunder, (f) subject to an agreement containing 
provisions at least as restrictive as those of this Section 10.08, to (i) 
any permitted assignee of or Participant in, or any permitted prospective 
assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this 
Agreement or any Eligible Assignee invited to be an Additional Lender or 
(ii) any actual or prospective direct or indirect counterparty (or its 
advisors) to any swap or derivative transaction relating to the Borrowers 
and its obligations, (g) with the consent of the Parent, (h) to any rating 
agency when required by it (it being understood that, prior to any such 
disclosure, such rating agency shall undertake to preserve the 
confidentiality of any Information relating to the Loan Parties received by 
it from such Lender in accordance with this Section 10.08) or (i) to the 
extent such Information (i) becomes publicly available other than as a 
result of a breach of this Section or (ii) becomes available to the 
Administrative Agent, any Lender, or any of their respective Affiliates on 
a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Parent, any Borrower 
or any Subsidiary, and which source is not known by such Agent or Lender to 
be subject to a confidentiality restriction in respect thereof in favor of 
the Parent or any Affiliate thereof.
 
For purposes of this Section, Information means all information received 
from any Loan Party or any Subsidiary (or from any representative or agent 
of such Loan Party or Subsidiary) thereof relating to any Loan Party or any 
Subsidiary thereof or their respective businesses, other than any such 
information that is available to the Administrative Agent or any Lender on 
a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by any Loan Party or any 
Subsidiary thereof; it being understood that all information received from 
the Parent, any Borrower or any Subsidiary after the Closing Date shall be 
deemed confidential unless such information is clearly identified at the 
time of delivery as not being confidential.  Any Person required to 
maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section 
shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so in 
accordance with its customary procedures if such Person has exercised the 
same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as 
such Person would accord to its own confidential information.
 
Each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders acknowledges that (a) the 
Information may include material non-public information concerning a 
Borrower or a Subsidiary, as the case may be, (b) it has developed 
compliance procedures regarding the use of material non-public information 
and (c) it will handle such material non-public information in accordance 
with applicable Law, including United States Federal and state securities 
Laws.
 
Section 10.09.      Setoff.  If an Event of Default shall have occurred and 
be continuing, each Lender and each of its Affiliates is hereby authorized 
at any time and from time to time, after obtaining the prior written 
consent of the Administrative Agent, to the fullest extent permitted by 
applicable law, to setoff and apply any and all deposits (general or 
special, time or demand, provisional or final, in whatever currency, but 
excluding payroll, employee benefits, tax, trust and other fiduciary 
deposit accounts) at any time held and other obligations (in whatever 
currency) at any time owing by such Lender or any such Affiliate to or for 
the credit or the account of any Borrower or any other Loan Party against 
any and all of the Obligations of such Borrower or such Loan Party now or 
hereafter existing under this Agreement or any other Loan Document to such 
Lender, irrespective of whether or not such Lender shall have made any 
demand under this Agreement or any other Loan Document to the extent such 
Obligations of such
 
133
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Borrower or such Loan Party are then due and payable.  The rights of each 
Lender and its Affiliates under this Section are in addition to other 
rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) that such Lender or 
its Affiliates may have.  Each Lender agrees to notify the Parent and the 
Administrative Agent promptly after any such setoff and application, 
provided that the failure to give such notice to the Parent shall not 
affect the validity of such setoff and application.
 
Section 10.10.      Interest Rate Limitation.  Notwithstanding anything to 
the contrary contained in any Loan Document, the interest paid or agreed to 
be paid under the Loan Documents shall not exceed the maximum rate of 
non-usurious interest permitted by applicable Law (the Maximum Rate).  If 
any Agent or any Lender shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds 
the Maximum Rate, the excess interest shall be applied to the principal of 
the Loans or, if it exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to the 
applicable Borrower.  In determining whether the interest contracted for, 
charged, or received by an Agent or a Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, such 
Person may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) characterize any 
payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or premium rather than 
interest, (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and 
(c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the 
total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the 
Obligations hereunder.
 
Section 10.11.      Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness.  This 
Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto 
in different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but 
all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract.  This 
Agreement and the other Loan Documents constitute the entire contract among 
the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all 
previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the 
subject matter hereof.  This Agreement shall become effective when the 
closing conditions set forth in Section 4.01 shall have been satisfied or 
waived.  Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this 
Agreement by telecopy or other electronic imaging means shall be effective 
as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.
 
Section 10.12.      Electronic Execution of Assignments and Certain Other 
Documents.  The words execution, signed, signature, and words of like 
import in any Assignment and Assumption or in any amendment or other 
modification hereof (including waivers and consents) shall be deemed to 
include electronic signatures or the keeping of records in electronic form, 
each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability 
as a manually executed signature or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping 
system, as the case may be, to the extent and as provided for in any 
applicable law, including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and 
National Commerce Act, the New York State Electronic Signatures and Records 
Act, or any other similar state laws based on the Uniform Electronic 
Transactions Act.
 
Section 10.13.      Survival of Representations and Warranties.  All 
representations and warranties made hereunder and (i) any other Loan 
Document or other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in 
connection herewith or therewith shall survive the execution and delivery 
hereof and thereof.  Such representations and warranties have been or will 
be relied
 
134
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
upon by the Administrative Agent and each Lender, regardless of any 
investigation made by the Administrative Agent or any Lender or on their 
behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may 
have had notice or knowledge of any Default at the time of any Borrowing, 
and shall continue in full force and effect as long as any Loan or any 
other Obligation (other than (x) obligations and liabilities under Secured 
Hedge Agreements as to which arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the 
applicable Hedge Bank shall have been made, (y) contingent indemnification 
obligations not yet accrued and payable and (z) Cash Management 
Obligations) hereunder shall remain unpaid or unsatisfied.
 
Section 10.14.      Severability.  If any provision of this Agreement or 
the other Loan Documents is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, 
(a) the legality, validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions 
of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall not be affected or 
impaired thereby and (b) the parties shall endeavor in good faith 
negotiations to replace the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions 
with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as 
possible to that of the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions.  The 
invalidity of a provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate 
or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.
 
Section 10.15.      GOVERNING LAW.
 
(a)           THIS AGREEMENT AND EACH OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED 
BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.
 
(b)           THE PARENT, EACH BORROWER, THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, EACH 
OTHER AGENT AND EACH LENDER EACH IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY SUBMITS, 
FOR ITSELF AND ITS PROPERTY, TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE COURTS OF 
THE STATE OF NEW YORK SITTING IN NEW YORK CITY IN THE BOROUGH OF MANHATTAN 
AND OF THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT OF THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW 
YORK, AND ANY APPELLATE COURT FROM ANY THEREOF, IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING 
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT, OR 
FOR RECOGNITION OR ENFORCEMENT OF ANY JUDGMENT, AND EACH OF THE PARTIES 
HERETO IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY AGREES THAT ALL CLAIMS IN RESPECT OF 
ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING MAY BE HEARD AND DETERMINED IN SUCH NEW YORK 
STATE COURT OR, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN SUCH 
FEDERAL COURT.  EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO AGREES THAT A FINAL JUDGMENT IN 
ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING SHALL BE CONCLUSIVE AND MAY BE ENFORCED IN 
OTHER JURISDICTIONS BY SUIT ON THE JUDGMENT OR IN ANY OTHER MANNER PROVIDED 
BY LAW.  EACH PARTY HERETO AGREES THAT THE AGENTS AND LENDERS RETAIN THE 
RIGHT TO SERVE PROCESS IN ANY OTHER MANNER PERMITTED BY LAW OR TO BRING 
PROCEEDINGS AGAINST ANY LOAN PARTY IN THE COURTS OF ANY OTHER JURISDICTION 
IN CONNECTION WITH THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS UNDER ANY COLLATERAL DOCUMENT 
OR THE ENFORCEMENT OF ANY JUDGMENT.
 
135
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
(c)           THE PARENT, EACH BORROWER, THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, EACH 
OTHER AGENT AND EACH LENDER EACH IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO 
THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY OBJECTION THAT IT MAY 
NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OF ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING 
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT IN 
ANY COURT REFERRED TO IN PARAGRAPH (b) OF THIS SECTION.  EACH OF THE 
PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED 
BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE DEFENSE OF AN INCONVENIENT FORUM TO THE MAINTENANCE 
OF SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING IN ANY SUCH COURT.
 
Section 10.16.      WAIVER OF RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.  EACH PARTY HERETO 
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE 
LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING 
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY 
OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY 
(WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY).  EACH PARTY HERETO 
(A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PERSON 
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PERSON WOULD NOT, 
IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) 
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO 
ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS BY, AMONG OTHER 
THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.
