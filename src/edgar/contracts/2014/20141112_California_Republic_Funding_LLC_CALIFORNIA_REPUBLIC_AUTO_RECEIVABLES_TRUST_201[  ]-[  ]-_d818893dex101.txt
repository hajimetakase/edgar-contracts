comply with this Agreement and the Indenture Trustee to comply with the 
Indenture. In performing its duties as Custodian, the Servicer shall act 
with reasonable care, and in accordance with the Servicing Standard. The 
Servicer shall conduct, or cause to be conducted, periodic audits of the 
Receivable Files held by it as Custodian under this Agreement and of the 
related accounts, records and computer systems, in such a manner as shall 
enable the Issuer or the Indenture Trustee to verify the accuracy of the 
Servicers record keeping, and the Issuer and
 
5

------------------------------------------------------------------------
the Indenture Trustee shall not be obligated to exercise any such rights, 
and shall have no liability for failing to exercise any such rights, to so 
verify the accuracy of the Servicers record keeping. The Servicer shall 
promptly report to the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee any failure on its 
part to hold the Receivable Files and maintain its accounts, records and 
computer systems as herein provided and shall promptly take appropriate 
action to remedy any such failure. Nothing herein shall be deemed to 
require an initial review or any periodic review by the Issuer, [the Backup 
Servicer] or the Indenture Trustee of the Receivable Files.


(b)        The Servicer shall maintain each Receivable File at one of its 
offices specified in Exhibit A to this Agreement or at such other office as 
shall be specified to the Issuer, [the Backup Servicer] and the Indenture 
Trustee by written notice not later than thirty (30) days after any change 
in location. Upon not less than thirty (30) days prior written notice to 
the Issuer, [the Backup Servicer], the Indenture Trustee and each Rating 
Agency, the Servicer may appoint an Affiliate to act as a sub-custodian to 
maintain up to all Receivable Files at such office of the Affiliate as is 
identified in such notice, provided, however, if either Rating Agency shall 
object in writing to such appointment it shall not be made and no 
Receivable File shall be maintained by such Affiliate. Any such Affiliate 
so appointed shall execute an agreement with the Servicer obligating the 
Affiliate to perform all functions otherwise required of the Servicer 
herein when acting as Custodian. The Servicer shall remain liable as 
Custodian notwithstanding the appointment of an Affiliate as sub-custodian 
and the maintenance by such Affiliate of Receivable Files. Upon reasonable 
notice by the Issuer or the Indenture Trustee, the Servicer shall make 
available to the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee or their duly authorized 
representatives, attorneys or auditors a list of locations of the 
Receivable Files and the related accounts, records and computer systems 
maintained by the Servicer during normal business hours and such review 
shall be conducted in a reasonable manner.


(c)        Upon reasonable request from the Indenture Trustee or, if the 
Notes have been Paid In Full, from the Owner Trustee, the Custodian shall 
release any Receivable File to the Indenture Trustee or the Owner Trustee, 
as the case may be, or to the agent or designee of the Indenture Trustee or 
the Owner Trustee, as the case may be, at such place or places as the 
Indenture Trustee or the Owner Trustee, as the case may be, may reasonably 
designate as soon as practicable. Upon the release and delivery of any such 
document in accordance with the instructions of the Indenture Trustee or 
the Owner Trustee, as the case may be, the Custodian shall be released from 
any further liability and responsibility under this Section 3.05 with 
respect to such documents and any other provision of this Agreement or any 
of the other Basic Documents if the fulfillment of the Custodians 
responsibilities is dependent upon possession of such documents, unless and 
until such time as such documents shall be returned to the Custodian. In no 
event shall the Custodian be responsible for any loss occasioned by the 
Indenture Trustees or the Owner Trustees failure to return any Receivable 
File or any portion thereof in a timely manner.


(d)        The Servicer shall not at any time have, or in any way attempt 
to assert, any interest in any Receivable held by it as Custodian hereunder 
or in the related Receivable File, other than for collecting or enforcing 
such Receivable for the benefit of the Issuer. The entire equitable 
interest in such Receivable and the related Receivable File shall at all 
times be vested in the Issuer.
 
6

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Section 3.06  Instructions; Authority to Act.    The Servicer shall be 
deemed to have received proper instructions with respect to the Receivable 
Files upon its receipt of written instructions signed by a Trust Officer of 
the Indenture Trustee, or, if the Notes have been Paid In Full, by a Trust 
Officer of the Owner Trustee. A certified copy of excerpts of authorizing 
resolutions of the board of directors of the Indenture Trustee shall 
constitute conclusive evidence of the authority of any such Trust Officer 
to act and shall be considered in full force and effect until receipt by 
the Servicer of written notice to the contrary given by the Indenture 
Trustee.


Section 3.07  Custodians Indemnification.


(a)        The Custodian shall indemnify the Issuer, the Owner Trustee, 
[the Backup Servicer] and the Indenture Trustee and each of their officers, 
directors, employees and agents for any and all liabilities, obligations, 
losses, compensatory damages, payments, costs or expenses of any kind 
whatsoever that may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the 
Issuer, the Owner Trustee, [the Backup Servicer] or the Indenture Trustee 
or any of their officers, directors, employees or agents as the result of 
any improper act or omission in any way relating to the maintenance and 
custody by the Custodian of the Receivable Files; provided, however, that 
the Custodian shall not be liable to the Issuer, the Owner Trustee, [the 
Backup Servicer,] the Indenture Trustee or any such officer, director, 
employee or agent of the Issuer, the Owner Trustee, [the Backup Servicer] 
or the Indenture Trustee for any portion of any such amount resulting from 
(i) actions taken by the Custodian pursuant to instructions as provided in 
Section 3.06, or (ii) release and delivery of documents by the Custodian as 
provided in Section 3.05(c) or (iii) the willful misfeasance, bad faith or 
gross negligence of such Person listed above, or any such officer, 
director, employee or agent of such Person.


(b)        Indemnification under this Section 3.07 shall survive the 
resignation or removal of the Custodian or the termination of this 
Agreement with respect to acts or omissions of the Custodian preceding such 
resignation or removal or termination and shall include reasonable fees and 
expenses of counsel and expenses of litigation. If the Custodian shall have 
made any indemnity payments pursuant to this Section 3.07 and the Person to 
or on behalf of whom such payments are made thereafter collects any of such 
amounts from others, such Person shall promptly repay such amounts to the 
Custodian.


Section 3.08  Effective Period and Termination.      The Servicers 
appointment as Custodian shall become effective as of the Closing Date and 
shall continue in full force and effect unless and until terminated 
pursuant to this Section 3.08 or Section 8.02(a). If the Servicer or any 
successor Servicer shall resign as Servicer in accordance with the 
provisions of this Agreement or if all of the rights and obligations of the 
Servicer or any successor Servicer are terminated under Section 8.02(a), 
the appointment of the Servicer as Custodian shall be terminated. The 
Indenture Trustee or, with the consent of the Indenture Trustee, the Owner 
Trustee may terminate the Servicers appointment as Custodian, with cause, 
at any time upon written notification to the Servicer. As soon as 
practicable after any termination of such appointment (but in no event more 
than five (5) Business Days after any such termination of appointment), the 
Custodian shall deliver the Receivable Files to the Indenture Trustee or 
the Indenture Trustees agent at such place or places as the Indenture 
Trustee may reasonably designate. Notwithstanding the termination of the 
Servicer as Custodian, the Indenture Trustee and the Issuer agree that, 
upon any such termination and for so long as the Servicer may not be
 
7

------------------------------------------------------------------------
acting as Custodian hereunder, the Indenture Trustee or the Issuer, as the 
case may be, shall provide, or cause its agent to provide, access to the 
Receivable Files to the Servicer for the purpose of enabling the Servicer 
to perform its obligations under this Agreement with respect to the 
servicing of the Receivables.


Section 3.09  Risk Retention.  The Seller, as sponsor, shall retain an 
economic interest in a material portion of the credit risk of the 
Receivables, which interest retention obligation may be satisfied by 
retaining a representative sample of the Receivables having a principal 
balance equal to not less than 5% of the Cutoff Date Pool Balance. This 
retained interest may not be sold, pledged or hedged, except for the 
hedging of interest rate or currency risk, during the term of the 
transactions contemplated hereby.


ARTICLE IV


ADMINISTRATION AND SERVICING OF RECEIVABLES


Section 4.01   Duties of Servicer.


(a)        The Servicer, for the benefit of the Noteholders, shall manage, 
service, administer and make collections on the Receivables and perform the 
other actions required by the Servicer under this Agreement. The Servicer 
shall be required to service the Receivables in accordance with reasonable 
care but in no event less than the care that the Servicer exercises with 
respect to all comparable motor vehicle retail installment sale contracts 
and installment loans that it services for itself or others or the 
procedures employed by banking institutions that service motor vehicle 
retail installment sale contracts or installment loans for their own 
account or for the account of third parties (the Servicing Standard). CRB 
agrees that for so long as CRB is the Servicer, the Servicing Standard 
shall be consistent in all material respects with the servicing standards 
with respect to motor vehicle retail installment sale contracts and 
installment loans, for which CRB or any of its Affiliates is the owner or 
the appointed servicer from time to time.


(b)        The Servicers duties shall include the collection and posting 
of all payments on the Receivables, responding to inquiries of Obligors, 
investigating delinquencies, sending payment coupons to Obligors, reporting 
any required tax information to Obligors, accounting for collections, 
furnishing monthly and annual statements to the Owner Trustee and the 
Indenture Trustee with respect to distributions and performing the other 
duties specified herein. The Servicer also shall administer and enforce all 
rights of the Issuer as holder of the Receivables and the Indenture Trustee 
as pledgee of the Receivables and shall enforce the provisions of the 
applicable Dealer Agreements and assignment forms. To the extent consistent 
with the Servicing Standard, the Servicer shall follow its customary 
standards, policies and procedures and shall have full power and authority, 
acting alone, to do any and all things in connection with the managing, 
servicing, administration and collection of the Receivables that it may 
reasonably in good faith in accordance with the Servicing Standard deem 
necessary or desirable.
 
8

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(c)        Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Servicer 
is hereby authorized and empowered to execute and deliver, on behalf of 
itself and any one or more of the Issuer, the Owner Trustee or the 
Indenture Trustee any and all instruments of satisfaction or cancellation, 
or of partial or full release or discharge, and all other comparable 
instruments with respect to the Receivables and with respect to the 
Financed Vehicles; provided, however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, 
the Servicer shall not, except (i) pursuant to an order from a court of 
competent jurisdiction or a directive from an arbitrator in an arbitration 
proceeding or (ii) in settlement of a legal proceeding in court or in 
arbitration in a manner consistent with the applicable Servicing Standard 
or (iii) otherwise in accordance with the Servicing Standard, and except as 
provided in Section 4.02(c), execute documents that would release an 
Obligor from payment of any unpaid amount due under any Receivable, reduce 
the related APR on a Receivable, waive the right to collect the unpaid 
balance of any Receivable from the related Obligor, release any Obligor 
from its obligations with respect to a Receivable, extend the final payment 
date under any Receivable beyond the Class C Final Scheduled Payment Date.


(d)        The Servicer is hereby authorized to commence, in its own name 
or in the name of the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee or the Owner Trustee, a 
legal proceeding to enforce the rights of the Issuer under any Contract 
pursuant to Section 4.03 or to commence or participate in any other legal 
proceeding (including a bankruptcy proceeding) relating to or involving a 
Receivable, an Obligor or a Financed Vehicle. If the Servicer commences or 
participates in any such legal proceeding in its own name, the Indenture 
Trustee or the Issuer shall thereupon be deemed to have automatically 
assigned the applicable Receivable to the Servicer, solely for purposes of 
commencing or participating in such proceeding as a party or claimant, and 
the Servicer is authorized and empowered by the Indenture Trustee or the 
Issuer to execute and deliver in the Indenture Trustees or the Issuers 
name any notices, demands, claims, complaints, responses, affidavits or 
other documents or instruments in connection with any such proceeding. If 
in any enforcement suit or legal proceeding it shall be held that the 
Servicer may not enforce the rights of the Issuer under the Contract on the 
ground that it shall not be a real party in interest or a holder entitled 
to enforce such rights, the Owner Trustee shall, subject to the terms of 
the Trust Agreement, at the Servicers expense and direction, take steps to 
enforce such rights, including bringing suit in its name or the name of the 
Issuer, the Indenture Trustee or the Noteholders. The Owner Trustee and the 
Indenture Trustee shall upon the written request of the Servicer furnish 
the Servicer as soon as practicable with any powers of attorney and other 
documents reasonably necessary or appropriate to enable the Servicer to 
carry out its servicing and administrative duties hereunder.


(e)        For all purposes of this Agreement, the Servicer shall be an 
independent contractor and shall not be subject to the supervision of the 
Issuer, the Owner Trustee or the Indenture Trustee with respect to the 
manner in which it accomplishes the performance of its obligations 
hereunder. Unless expressly set forth herein or otherwise authorized by the 
Issuer, the Servicer shall have no authority to act for or represent the 
Issuer, the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee or any Noteholder in any 
way and shall not otherwise be deemed an agent of the Issuer, the Owner 
Trustee, the Indenture Trustee or any Noteholder.


Section 4.02  Collection of Payments on Receivables; Extensions.


(a)        The Servicer shall make reasonable efforts to collect all 
payments called for under the terms and provisions of the Contracts as and 
when the same shall become due, in accordance with the Servicing Standard.
 
9

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(b)        (i) The Servicer may grant payment extensions and holidays on 
the Receivables in accordance with the Servicing Standard and as required 
by law; provided, however, that no such extension shall extend the final 
payment date on any Receivable beyond the last day of the Collection Period 
immediately preceding the Class C Final Scheduled Payment Date, and (ii) 
upon any extension of a Receivable not in accordance with Section 
4.02(b)(i) or upon the reduction of the APR or Principal Balance of any 
Receivable other than as required by Applicable Law (including by the 
Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, the California Military Families Financial 
Relief Act or similar State law), the Servicer shall be required to 
purchase the related Receivable in accordance with Section 4.07.


(c)        Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Servicer is authorized in its 
discretion to grant a Small Balance Waiver with respect to any Receivable, 
and to waive any prepayment charge, late payment charge or any other 
similar fees that may be collected in the ordinary course of servicing any 
Receivable.


Section 4.03  Realization upon Receivables.


(a)        Consistent with the Servicing Standard, the Servicer shall use 
commercially reasonable efforts to repossess or otherwise convert the 
ownership of and liquidate any Financed Vehicle securing a Receivable with 
respect to which the Servicer shall have determined that eventual payment 
in full is unlikely. The Servicer shall begin such repossession and 
conversion procedures as soon as practicable after default on such 
Receivable in accordance with the Servicing Standard; provided, however, 
that the Servicer will not repossess or otherwise convert the ownership of 
a Financed Vehicle within such time period if it calculates that the 
proceeds ultimately recoverable with respect to the related Receivable 
would be increased by forbearance. In repossessing or otherwise converting 
the ownership of a Financed Vehicle and liquidating the related Receivable, 
the Servicer is authorized to follow such customary practices and 
procedures as it shall reasonably deem necessary or advisable, consistent 
with the Servicing Standard, which practices and procedures may include the 
sale of the Financed Vehicle at public or private sale, the submission of 
claims under an insurance policy and other actions by the Servicer in order 
to realize upon such Receivable; provided, however, that in any case in 
which the Financed Vehicle shall have suffered damage, the Servicer shall 
not expend funds in connection with any repair or towards the repossession 
of such Financed Vehicle unless it shall determine in its reasonable 
judgment that such repair or repossession shall increase the related 
Liquidation Proceeds by an amount materially greater than the expense for 
such repair or repossession. The Servicer shall be entitled to recover all 
expenses incurred by it that are reasonably allocated to repossessing and 
liquidating a Financed Vehicle into cash proceeds (other than overhead), 
but only out of the cash proceeds of the sale of such Financed Vehicle or 
any deficiency obtained from the related Obligor.


(b)        If the Servicer elects to commence a Proceeding to enforce a 
Dealer Agreement, the act of commencement shall be deemed to be an 
automatic assignment from the Issuer to the Servicer of the rights of 
recourse under such Dealer Agreement. If, however, in any Proceeding, it is 
held that the Servicer may not enforce a Dealer Agreement on the grounds 
that it is not a real party in interest or a Person entitled to enforce the 
Dealer Agreement, the Issuer, at the Servicers expense and direction, 
shall take such steps as the Servicer deems necessary to enforce the Dealer 
Agreement, including bringing suit in its name or the names of the 
Indenture Trustee, not in its individual capacity, but solely as Indenture 
Trustee on behalf of the Issuer, or the Holders of the Notes.
 
10

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Section 4.04  Physical Damage Insurance.   The Servicer shall, in 
accordance with the Servicing Standard, require that each Obligor shall 
have obtained physical loss damage insurance covering the related Financed 
Vehicle as of the execution of the related Contract.


Section 4.05  Maintenance of Security Interests in Financed Vehicles; Other 
Amounts.


(a)        The Servicer shall, in accordance with the Servicing Standard, 
take such steps as are necessary to maintain the perfection of the security 
interest created by each Receivable in the related Financed Vehicle. The 
Servicer is hereby authorized to take such steps as are necessary to 
re-perfect such security interest on behalf of the Issuer and the Indenture 
Trustee in the event of the relocation of a Financed Vehicle or for any 
other reason. In the event that the assignment of a Receivable to the 
Issuer is insufficient, without a notation on the related Financed 
Vehicles certificate of title or without fulfilling any additional 
administrative requirements under the laws of the State in which such 
Financed Vehicle is located, to perfect a security interest in the related 
Financed Vehicle in favor of the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee, each of 
the Servicer and CRB hereby agree that the designation of CRB as the 
secured party on such certificate of title shall only be in its capacity as 
agent of the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee. The Servicer shall not 
release, in whole or in part, any security interest in a Financed Vehicle 
created by the related Receivable except as permitted herein or in 
accordance with its customary standards, policies, practices and 
procedures, including the payment in full by the Obligor of all amounts 
payable pursuant to that Receivable.


(b)        The Seller, the Depositor, the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee and 
the Servicer hereby agree that, upon the occurrence of a Servicer 
Termination Event, the Noteholders representing a majority of the Note 
Balance of the Outstanding Notes of the Controlling Class may take or cause 
to be taken such actions as may in the Opinion of Counsel to such 
Noteholders, be necessary to perfect or re-perfect the security interests 
in the Financed Vehicles in the name of the Issuer, including by amending 
the title documents of the Financed Vehicles. The Servicer hereby agrees to 
pay all expenses related to such perfection or re-perfection and to take 
all action necessary therefor. If such expenses are not paid within fifteen 
(15) days after delivery of any invoice therefor, such expenses shall be 
paid from the amounts otherwise payable to the Servicer pursuant to Section 
5.04(a)(i).


Section 4.06  Covenants of Servicer.   By its execution and delivery of 
this Agreement, the Servicer hereby covenants as follows (upon which 
covenants the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee and the Owner Trustee rely in 
accepting the Collateral and delivering the Notes):


(a)        Liens in Force.   No Financed Vehicle securing a Receivable 
shall be released in whole or in part from the security interest granted by 
the Obligor, except upon payment in full of such Receivable (subject to any 
Small Balance Waiver) or as otherwise contemplated herein or in accordance 
with the Servicing Standard.
 
11

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(b)        No Impairment.  The Servicer shall do nothing to impair the 
rights of the Issuer or the Indenture Trustee in the property of the 
Issuer.


(c)        No Amendments.  The Servicer shall not extend or otherwise amend 
the terms of any Receivable, except in accordance with the Servicing 
Standard, Section 4.01(c) and Section 4.02.


(d)        Notice of Material Litigation.    The Servicer shall provide 
notice of material litigation, actions or judgments involving CRB or the 
Depositor to the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee; provided that, except 
with respect to any such material litigation, actions or judgments 
involving the Issuer or the Depositor, the Servicer shall be deemed to have 
complied with the foregoing covenant with respect to any material 
litigation or judgments relating to the Servicer, to the extent that it or 
its parent company (California Republic Bancorp) properly complied with its 
disclosure obligations under the Exchange Act.


(e)        Compliance with Agreement, Basic Documents and Applicable Law.   
  The Servicer shall comply with its obligations under this Agreement and 
the other Basic Documents to which it is a party. The Servicer shall comply 
with all Applicable Law where the failure to do so could reasonably be 
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.


(f)        Arms Length.   With respect to its obligations in connection 
with the Conveyed Assets, the Servicer shall transact and deal with its 
Affiliates on an arms length basis.


(g)        Licenses and Approvals.   The Servicer shall ensure that it has 
and maintains all licenses and approvals necessary for the conduct of its 
business in the jurisdictions where the Financed Vehicles are located.


(h)        Restrictions on Liens.  The Servicer shall not (i) create, incur 
or suffer to exist, or agree to create, incur or suffer to exist, or 
consent to or permit in the future (upon the occurrence of a contingency or 
otherwise) the creation, incurrence or existence of any Lien (other than 
suffering to exist any tax liens, mechanics liens and any other liens that 
attach to property by operation of law (including statutory purchase liens) 
to the extent the applicable obligations are not past due) on or 
restriction on transferability of any Receivable except for the Lien of the 
Indenture and the restrictions on transferability imposed by this Agreement 
or (ii) other than as contemplated herein or in the Indenture, file or 
authorize the filing in any jurisdiction of any UCC financing statement 
that names CRB, the Depositor or any other Person as a debtor, and any 
Person other than the Depositor, the Indenture Trustee or the Issuer as a 
secured party, or sign any security agreement authorizing any secured party 
thereunder to file any such financing statement, in each case with respect 
to the Receivables.


Section 4.07  Purchase of Receivables by Servicer upon Breach of Covenant.  
  Upon discovery by any of the Servicer, the Seller, the Depositor, the 
Issuer or a Trust Officer of the Indenture Trustee of a breach of any of 
the covenants set forth in Sections 4.02(b), 4.05(a) or 4.06, the party 
discovering such breach shall give prompt written notice to the other 
parties hereto; provided, however, that the failure to give any such notice 
shall not affect any obligation of the Servicer under this Section 4.07. 
Within thirty (30) days of the discovery or notice of such breach, the 
Servicer shall use its best efforts to cure such breach. On or before the 
Payment Date
 
12

------------------------------------------------------------------------
immediately following the end of the Collection Period in which the 30-day 
cure period referred to above has ended, the Servicer shall, unless such 
breach shall have been cured by such date, purchase from the Issuer the 
Receivable(s) affected by such breach. In consideration of the purchase of 
such Receivable(s), the Servicer shall remit the related Repurchase Price 
into the Collection Account, with written notice to the Indenture Trustee 
of such deposit, in the manner specified in Section 5.05. Subject to 
Section 7.03, it is understood and agreed that the obligation of the 
Servicer to purchase any Receivable with respect to which such a breach has 
occurred and is continuing shall, if such obligation is fulfilled, 
constitute the sole remedy against the Servicer for such breach available 
to the Issuer, the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee or the Noteholders.


Section 4.08  Servicing Fee.   The Servicing Fee shall be payable to the 
Servicer on each Payment Date. That part of the Servicing Fee that is based 
on the Servicing Fee Rate shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day 
year comprised of twelve 30-day months. The Servicer shall be required to 
pay all expenses (apart from expenses incurred in accordance with the 
Servicing Standard in connection with liquidating a Financed Vehicle 
related to a Liquidated Receivable, such as auction, painting, repair or 
refurbishment in respect of that Financed Vehicle) incurred by it in 
connection with its activities under this Agreement (including taxes 
imposed on the Servicer, expenses incurred in connection with distributions 
and reports made by the Servicer to the Owner Trustee and the Indenture 
Trustee and any fees and expenses of sub-servicers to whom it has delegated 
servicing responsibilities).


Section 4.09  Servicers Monthly Certificate.   Not later than 10:00 a.m. 
(New York City time) on each Determination Date, the Servicer shall deliver 
to the Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee, with a copy to each Rating 
Agency, a Servicers Monthly Certificate, in substantially the form of 
Exhibit B-1, containing all information necessary to make the payments to 
be made on the related Payment Date pursuant to Section 5.04 for the 
related Collection Period and any other information the Indenture Trustee 
may reasonably request. Such Servicers Monthly Certificate shall be 
certified by a Responsible Officer of the Servicer that the information 
provided is complete, accurate and no event has occurred that, with notice 
or passage of time, would be an Event of Default or a Servicer Termination 
Event. The Servicer shall also specify to the Trustees, no later than the 
Determination Date following the last day of a Collection Period as of 
which the Seller shall separately identify (by account number), in a 
written notice to the Depositor and the Trustees, the Receivables to be 
repurchased by the Seller or purchased by the Servicer, as the case may be, 
for the related Collection Period.


Section 4.10  Annual Statement as to Compliance; Notice of Servicer 
Termination Event.


(a)        The Servicer shall deliver to the Issuer, the Depositor, the 
Indenture Trustee, and each Rating Agency, prior to March 31 of each 
calendar year, beginning with March 31, 2015, an officers certificate 
signed by a Responsible Officer of the Servicer (the Servicers Annual 
Certification) in substantially the form of Exhibit B-2.


(b)        The Servicer shall deliver to the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee, 
each Rating Agency and the Depositor, promptly after having obtained 
knowledge thereof, but in no event later than two (2) Business Days 
thereafter, written notice in an officers certificate from a Responsible 
Officer thereof of any event that is, or with the giving of notice or lapse 
of time or both would become, a Servicer Termination Event.
 
13

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(c)        Prior to March 31 of each calendar year, beginning with March 
31, 2015, the Servicer shall deliver to the Issuer, the Owner Trustee and 
the Administrator and any other Person that will be responsible for signing 
the certification required by Rules 13a-14(d) and 15d-14(d) under the 
Exchange Act (pursuant to Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002) on 
behalf of the Issuer with respect to a securitization transaction a 
certification in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B-3.

Assessment of Compliance.

during the preceding calendar year (or, with respect to the first report, 
the period from the Closing Date to December 31 of such year), and that, on 
the basis of such examination, nothing has come to their attention that 
would indicate that such servicing has not been conducted in compliance 
therewith during such calendar year or other period, except for (x) such 
exceptions as such firm shall believe to be immaterial and (y) such other 
exceptions as shall be set forth in such statement; provided, however, that

thirty (30) days of its receipt of such report.


(b)        Notwithstanding Section 4.11(a), prior to March 31 of each 
calendar year, beginning with March 31, 2015, the Servicer shall deliver 
the report and attestation set forth in Sections 4.11(c) and (d) and the 
delivery of a copy of such report and attestation to the Depositor and the 
Trustees shall be deemed to satisfy the provisions of this Section.


(c)        As and when required pursuant to Section 4.11(b), the Servicer 
will deliver to the Depositor and the Trustees a report regarding the 
Servicers assessment of compliance with the Servicing Criteria during the

the Exchange Act and Item 1122 of Regulation AB. Such report shall be

Section 4.12  Access to Certain Documentation and Information Regarding 
Receivables. The Servicer shall provide to representatives of the Owner

documentation regarding the Receivables Files. Access shall be afforded 
without charge, but only upon reasonable request and conducted in a 
reasonable manner, during the normal business hours at the offices of the 
Servicer. Nothing in this Section shall affect the obligation of the 
Servicer to observe any Applicable Law prohibiting disclosure of 
information regarding the Obligors and the failure of the Servicer to 
provide access to information as a result of such obligation shall not 
constitute a breach of this Section.

Section 4.15  Agreement on Compliance.  The Servicer agrees that, should 
any Governmental Authority with bank regulatory powers find that the terms 
of this Agreement, or any agreement relating to the servicing of the 
Receivables constitute an unsafe and unsound condition with respect to the 
Servicer and such Governmental Authority notifies the Servicer of such 
finding, then the Servicer shall negotiate in good faith with the Issuer to 
correct any such deficiencies and to bring this Agreement into compliance 
with Applicable Law.

forth in Section 5.07. Any provision in this Agreement to the contrary 
notwithstanding, [            ] (acting in any capacity hereunder) shall 
have no liability for any acts, omissions, negligence, fraud or malfeasance 
by any Servicer (other than [            ] should it become Servicer 
hereunder) or any other party to this Agreement with respect to the 
performance by the Servicer or other party to this Agreement of its duties 
hereunder, or for any errors made by the Servicer or other party to this 
Agreement in the performance of such duties which cause any losses to

Section 4.18  Exchange Act Reporting.  The Indenture Trustee and the 
Servicer shall reasonably cooperate with the Depositor in connection with 
the satisfaction of the Depositors reporting requirements under the 
Exchange Act with respect to the Issuer. So long as the Depositor is 
required to file Exchange Act Reports with respect to the Issuer, each of 
the Indenture Trustee and the Servicer shall promptly notify the Depositor, 
and, in the case of an event reportable on the Form 8-K, not later than two 
(2) Business Days after its occurrence, of any event reportable on the 
Exchange Act Reports of which such Person (or in the case of the Indenture 
Trustee, a Trust Officer of such Person) has knowledge. In addition, if so 
requested by the Depositor for the purpose of satisfying its reporting 
obligation under the Exchange Act, the Indenture Trustee and the Servicer 
shall provide the Depositor with (i) such information which is available to 
such Person without unreasonable effort or expense and within such 
timeframe as may be reasonably requested by the Depositor to comply with 
the Depositors reporting obligations under the Exchange Act and (ii) to 
the extent such Person is a party (and the Depositor is not a party) to any 
agreement or amendment required to be filed, copies of such agreement or 
amendment in EDGAR-compatible form. Each of the Servicer and the Indenture 
Trustee acknowledges that interpretations of the requirements of Regulation 
AB may change over time, whether due to interpretive guidance provided by 
the Commission or its staff, consensus among participants in the 
asset-backed securities markets, advice of counsel, or
 
16

------------------------------------------------------------------------
otherwise, and agrees to comply with requests made by the Depositor in good 
faith for delivery of information under these provisions on the basis of 
evolving interpretations of Regulation AB and related rules and 
regulations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, so long as 
the Depositor is required to file Exchange Act Reports:


(a)        No later than each Determination Date, each of the Indenture 
Trustee and the Servicer shall notify (and the Servicer shall cause any 
subservicer to notify) the Depositor of any Form 10-D Disclosure Item with 
respect to such Person (or in the case of the Indenture Trustee, a Trust 
Officer of such Person), together with a description of any such Form 10-D 
Disclosure Item in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the 
Depositor. In addition to such information as the Servicer is obligated to 
provide pursuant to other provisions of this Agreement, if so requested by 
the Depositor, the Servicer shall provide such information which is 
available to the Servicer, without unreasonable effort or expense regarding 
the performance or servicing of the Receivables as is reasonably required 
to facilitate preparation of distribution reports in accordance with Item 
1121 of Regulation AB. Such information shall be provided concurrently with 
the statements to Noteholders pursuant to Section 5.06, commencing with the 
first such report due not less than five (5) Business Days following such 
request.


(b)        Each of the Indenture Trustee and the Servicer shall promptly 
notify the Depositor, but in no event later than two (2) Business Days 
after its occurrence, of any Form 8-K Reportable Event of which such Person 
(or in the case of the Indenture Trustee, a Trust Officer of such Person) 
has actual knowledge. Each Person, other than the Indenture Trustee as set 
forth above, shall be deemed to have actual knowledge of any such event to 
the extent that it relates to such Person or any action or failure to act 
by such Person.


(c)        No later than March 15 of each year, commencing in 2015, the 
Indenture Trustee and the Servicer shall notify the Depositor of any Form 
10-K Disclosure Item, together with a description of any such Form 10-K 
Disclosure Item in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the 
Depositor. If any of the Item 1119 Parties have changed since the Closing 
Date, no later than February 1 of each year, commencing in 2015, the 
Depositor shall provide each of the Indenture Trustee and the Servicer with 
an updated list of the Item 1119 Parties.


(d)        On or before March 15 of each calendar year, commencing in 2015:


(i)        The Indenture Trustee shall deliver to the Depositor and the 
Servicer the Servicing Criteria Assessment. Such report shall be signed by 
an authorized officer of the Indenture Trustee and shall at a minimum 
address each of the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of 
Regulation AB delivered to the Depositor concurrently with the execution of 
this Agreement (provided that such certification may be revised after the 
date of this Agreement as agreed by the Depositor and the Indenture Trustee 
to reflect any guidance with respect to such criteria from the Commission). 
To the extent any of the Servicing Criteria are not applicable to the 
Indenture Trustee, with respect to asset-backed securities transactions 
taken as a whole involving the Indenture Trustee and that are backed by the 
same asset type backing the Notes, such report shall include such a 
statement to that effect. The Indenture Trustee acknowledges and agrees 
that the Depositor and the Servicer with respect to its duties as the 
Certifying Person, and each of their respective officers and directors 
shall be entitled to rely upon each such servicing criteria assessment and 
the attestation delivered pursuant to Section 4.11.
 
17

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(ii)        The Indenture Trustee shall deliver to the Depositor and the 
Servicer a report of a registered public accounting firm that attests to, 
and reports on, the assessment of compliance made by the Indenture Trustee 
and delivered pursuant to the preceding paragraph. Such attestation shall 
be in accordance with Rules 13a-18 and 15d-18 of the Exchange Act (or any 
successor provisions), Rules 1-02(a)(3) and 2-02(g) of Regulation S-X (or 
any successor provisions) under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, 
including, that, in the event that an overall opinion cannot be expressed, 
such registered public accounting firm shall state in such report why it 
was unable to express such an opinion. Such report must be available for 
general use and not contain restricted use language.


(iii)        In the event the Indenture Trustee is terminated or resigns 
during the term of this Agreement, such Person shall provide the documents 
and information pursuant to this Section with respect to the period of time 
it was subject to this Agreement or provided services with respect to the 
Issuer or the Receivables.


(e)        The Indenture Trustee represents that:


(i)        there are no affiliations relating to the Indenture Trustee with 
respect to any Item 1119 Party;


(ii)        there are no relationships or transactions with respect to any 
Item 1119 Party and the Indenture Trustee that are outside the ordinary 
course of business or on terms other than would be obtained in an 
arms-length transaction with an unrelated third party, apart from the 
transactions contemplated under the Basic Documents, and that are material 
to the investors understanding of the Notes; and


(iii)        no litigation is pending or, to the best of the Indenture 
Trustees knowledge, threatened against the Indenture Trustee that, if 
determined adversely to the Indenture Trustee, in the Indenture Trustees 
good faith and reasonable judgment, is likely to materially and adversely 
affect the ability of the Indenture Trustee to perform its obligations 
under this Agreement.

(a)        The Issuer, for the benefit of the Noteholders, shall cause the 
Indenture Trustee to establish and maintain in the name of the Indenture 
Trustee three non-interest bearing Eligible Accounts (respectively, the 
Collection Account, the Principal Distribution Account and the Reserve 
Account), each bearing a designation clearly indicating that the funds 
deposited therein are held for the benefit of [                    ] as 
Indenture Trustee on behalf of the Noteholders.
 
18

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(b)        Funds deposited in each of the Trust Accounts (including 
amounts, if any, which the Servicer is required to remit to the Collection 
Account pursuant to Section 5.02) shall be invested first in Federated 
Prime Obligations Fund #143 for so long as Federated Prime Obligations Fund 
#143 is a Permitted Investment. If Federated Prime Obligations Fund #143 
ceases to be a Permitted Investment, the funds deposited in each of the 
Trust Accounts shall second be held in Goldman Sachs Prime Obligations Fund 
#1235 for so long as Goldman Sachs Prime Obligations Fund #1235 is a 
Permitted Investment. If Goldman Sachs Prime Obligations Fund #1235 ceases 
to be a Permitted Investment, the funds deposited in each of the Trust 
Accounts shall third be held in JPM Prime Money Fund #349 for so long as 
JPM Prime Money Fund #349 is a Permitted Investment. If JPM Prime Money 
Fund #349 ceases to be a Permitted Investment, the funds deposited in each 
of the Trust Accounts shall be invested at the written direction of the 
Servicer in a money market mutual fund (provided such fund is a Permitted 
Investment) that has a principal investment strategy and an investment 
objective that are each substantially identical to Federated Prime 
Obligations Fund #143. Such investments shall mature, in the case of the 
Reserve Account, prior to the Business Day prior to the next Payment Date, 
and, in the case of the Collection Account, on the Payment Date in the 
Collection Period following the Collection Period during which the 
investment was made; provided that neither the Servicer nor the Indenture 
Trustee shall have the power or right to change or alter the particular 
Permitted Investments identified in the preceding four sentences with 
respect to which such funds are invested; and provided further that the 
Servicer shall provide written notice to the Indenture Trustee, promptly 
upon any investment in each of the Trust Accounts ceasing to be a Permitted 
Investment, and such notification shall include an instruction to the 
Indenture Trustee to withdraw the funds from the ineligible investment and 
to deposit such funds into the applicable Permitted Investment set forth in 
this Section 5.01(d). All Permitted Investments shall be held by the 
Indenture Trustee for the benefit of the Noteholders and no Permitted 
Investments may be purchased at a premium. Amounts invested in Permitted 
Investments may not be converted into cash, sold or otherwise disposed of 
other than (i) upon maturity of the related investment, (ii) upon the date 
the related investment no longer meets the investment criteria of a 
Permitted Investment, or (iii) on any Payment Date, in order to allow the 
amount invested to be distributed to the Noteholders or Certificateholders 
in accordance with Section 5.04.


(c)        For so long as CRB is acting as Servicer hereunder, in the event 
that there are Net Investment Losses in Permitted Investments chosen by the 
Servicer, the Servicer shall deposit the amount of such Net Investment 
Losses into the Collection Account no later than one Business Day prior to 
the Payment Date. The Indenture Trustee shall not be held liable in any way 
for any Net Investment Losses, except for losses attributable to the 
Indenture Trustees failure to make payments on such Permitted Investments 
issued by the Indenture Trustee, in its commercial capacity as principal 
obligor and not as Indenture Trustee, in accordance with their terms.


(d)        (i)         The Indenture Trustee shall possess all right, title 
and interest in all funds and investment property on deposit from time to 
time in or credited to the Trust Accounts and in all proceeds thereof 
(including all income thereon) and all such funds, investment property, 
proceeds and income shall be part of the assets of the Issuer, except as 
otherwise set forth herein. The Trust Accounts shall be under the sole 
dominion and control of the Indenture Trustee for the benefit of the 
Noteholders. The Servicer shall have no power or right to change
 
19

------------------------------------------------------------------------
or alter any of the foregoing initial specifications in Section 5.01(d); 
provided that if, at any time, any Trust Account ceases to be an Eligible 
Account, the Indenture Trustee (or the Servicer on its behalf) shall within 
ten (10) Business Days (or such longer period, not to exceed thirty (30) 
calendar days, as to which each Rating Agency may consent) establish a new 
Trust Account as an Eligible Account and shall transfer any cash and/or any 
investments from the account that is no longer an Eligible Account to the 
new Trust Account.

agrees, by its acceptance hereof, that:

Section 5.01(d)(i); and each such Eligible Account shall be subject to the 
exclusive custody and control of the Indenture Trustee, and the Indenture

definition of Delivery and shall be maintained by the Indenture Trustee, 
pending maturity or disposition, through continued book-entry registration 
of such Trust Account Property as described in such paragraph;


(D)     any Trust Account Property that is an uncertificated security 
under Article 8 of the UCC and that is not governed by clause (C) above 
shall be delivered to the Indenture Trustee in accordance with paragraph 
(c) of the definition of Delivery and shall be maintained by the 
Indenture Trustee, pending maturity or disposition, through continued 
registration of the Indenture Trustees (or its nominees) ownership of 
such security; and


(E)     any Trust Account Property that is a Security Entitlement shall be 
delivered in accordance with paragraph (d) of the definition of Delivery 
herein and shall be held pending maturity or disposition by the Indenture 
Trustee or a securities intermediary acting solely for the Indenture 
Trustee.


(iii)     The Servicer shall have the power (which power shall be revocable 
by the Indenture Trustee, or by the Owner Trustee with the consent of the 
Indenture Trustee, following a Servicer Termination Event) to instruct the 
Indenture Trustee to make withdrawals and payments from the Trust Accounts 
held by the Indenture Trustee for the

action pursuant to this Agreement; provided, however, that this provision 
shall not protect the Servicer against any liability by reason of willful 
misfeasance, bad faith or negligence in the performance of its duties nor

(b)        Should the Indenture Trustee at any time agree to become 
successor Servicer hereunder, the parties expressly acknowledge and consent 
to the Indenture Trustees simultaneously acting in the capacity of 
successor Servicer and Indenture Trustee. The Indenture Trustee may, in 
such capacities, discharge its separate functions fully, without hindrance 
or regard to conflict of interest principles, duty of loyalty principles or 
other breach of fiduciary duties to the extent that any such conflict or 
breach arises from the performance by the Indenture Trustee of express 
duties set forth in this Agreement in any of such capacities.


(c)        [[        ] undertakes to perform only such duties and 
obligations as are specifically set forth in this Agreement, it being 
expressly understood by all parties hereto that there are no implied duties 
or obligations of [        ] hereunder. Without limiting the generality of 
the foregoing, [        ], except as expressly set forth herein, shall have 
no obligation to supervise, verify, monitor or administer the performance 
of the Servicer. [        ] may act through its agents, nominees, attorneys 
and custodians in performing any of its duties and obligations under this 
Agreement but any such appointment shall not release [        ] from its 
obligations and responsibilities hereunder.


Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, in no event 
shall [        ] be liable for any consequential, incidental or special 
damages, including, but not limited to damages for loss of currency, funds, 
data, profits or goodwill. [        ]s maximum liability for any breach of 
this Agreement by it in its capacity as Backup Servicer shall not exceed 
the fees actually paid to [        ] hereunder for the services as Backup 
Servicer for the 12 month period immediately preceding such breach, 
provided, however, that the limitations set forth in this Section 7.05 
shall not apply to or in any way limit [        ]s liability arising from 
the willful misconduct or gross negligence of [        ]. It is expressly 
agreed and acknowledged that [        ] is not guaranteeing or insuring the 
performance of or assuming any liability for the obligations of the other 
parties hereto or any of the Receivables.


[        ] makes no warranty or representation and shall have no 
responsibility as to the content, enforceability, completeness, validity, 
sufficiency, value, genuineness, ownership or transferability of the 
Receivables, will not be required to and will not make any representations 
as to the validity or value of any of the Receivables, shall not be 
responsible for the eligibility of any Receivable, or, except as is 
otherwise provided hereunder in the event [        ] is then acting as 
successor Servicer, for the validity, perfection, priority or 
enforceability of the liens in any of the Receivables, for insuring the 
Receivables or for the payment of taxes, charges, assessments or Liens upon 
the Receivables or otherwise as to the maintenance of the Receivables.]

(a)        Subject to clause (b) below, the Servicer may at any time 
reasonably appoint a subservicer in good faith to perform all or any 
portion of its obligations as Servicer hereunder.


(b)        The appointment of a subservicer pursuant to clause (a) above is 
subject to the condition that the Servicer remains obligated and liable to 
the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee and the Noteholders for the 
servicing and administering of the Receivables in accordance with the 
provisions hereof without diminution of such obligation and liability by 
virtue of the appointment of such subservicer and to the same extent and

and administering the Conveyed Assets.


(c)        The fees and expenses of any subservicer shall be as agreed 
between the Servicer and such subservicer from time to time, and none of 
the Owner Trustee, the Backup Servicer, the Indenture Trustee, the Issuer 
or the Noteholders shall have any responsibility therefor.

to the Servicer may at its discretion, upon becoming successor Servicer,

permissible under Applicable Law.


(b)        Notice of any determination that the performance by the Servicer 
or the Backup Servicer of its duties contemplated hereunder is no longer 
permitted under Applicable Law shall be communicated to the Owner Trustee 
and the Indenture Trustee at the earliest practicable time (and, if such 
communication is not in writing, shall be confirmed in writing at the 
earliest practicable time) and any such determination shall be evidenced by 
an Opinion of Counsel to such effect delivered by the Servicer or the 
Backup Servicer to the Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee concurrently 
with or promptly after such notice. Except as may otherwise be required by 
Applicable Law, no resignation of the Servicer or the Backup Servicer shall 
become effective until a successor acceptable to the Noteholders 
representing a majority of the Note Balance of the Outstanding Notes of the 
Controlling Class shall have assumed the responsibilities and obligations 
of such Person in accordance with Section 8.03. If no successor has been 
appointed within thirty (30) days of resignation or removal, the 
Noteholders representing a majority of the Note Balance of the Outstanding 
Notes of the Controlling Class may petition any court of competent 
jurisdiction for such appointment.


Section 7.08  CRB May Own Notes.  CRB and any Affiliate thereof may in its

any time the right to direct the appointment of any Eligible Servicer as 
the successor to the Servicer, and shall have no liability to the Owner

responsibilities, duties and liabilities arising thereafter relating 
thereto placed on its predecessor, and shall be entitled to the Servicing

and any Servicer Termination Event arising therefrom shall be deemed to 
have been remedied for every purpose of this Agreement. No such waiver 
shall extend to any subsequent or other default or impair any right 
consequent thereto.

debtor or words to that effect, and any limitations on such collateral 
description, notwithstanding that such collateral description may be 
broader in scope than the Conveyed Assets described in this Agreement. All 
financing statements filed or to be filed against in connection with this 
Agreement describing the Collateral shall contain a statement to the 
following effect: A purchase of, or grant of a security interest in, any

name, identity or limited liability company or corporate structure, as 
applicable, in any manner that would, could or might make any financing

it shall have given the Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee at least 
forty-five (45) days prior written notice thereof and shall have promptly 
filed appropriate amendments to all previously filed financing statements 
or continuation statements.


(c)        Each of the Depositor, the Issuer and CRB shall give the Owner 
Trustee and the Indenture Trustee at least thirty (30) Business Days prior 
written notice of any relocation of its principal executive office if, as a 
result of such relocation, the applicable provisions of the UCC would 
require the filing of any amendment of any previously filed financing or 
continuation statement or of any new financing statement, and shall 
promptly file any such amendment or new financing statement. The Servicer 
shall at all times maintain each office from which it shall service 
Receivables, and its principal executive office, within the United States

(d)        The Servicer shall maintain accounts and records as to each

computer systems so that, from and after the time of sale of the

subject of this Agreement and is held by the Indenture Trustee for the 
Issuer. Indication of such inclusion of a Receivable in the portfolio shall 
be deleted from or modified on its computer systems when, and only when,

reallocated, as the case may be.


(f)        If at any time the Depositor or CRB shall propose to sell, grant 
a security interest in or otherwise transfer any interest in any motor 
vehicle retail installment sale contract or installment loan to any 
prospective purchaser, lender or other transferee, and provides such 
prospective purchaser, lender or other transferee, if any, any computer 
tapes, records or printouts (including any restored from backup archives) 
that refer in any manner whatsoever to any Receivable, such computer tapes, 
records or printouts (including any restored from backup archives) shall
