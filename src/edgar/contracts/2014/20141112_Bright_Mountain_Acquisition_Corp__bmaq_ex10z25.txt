 SECTION 2.04. Taxes.

(a)
 Tenant, beginning with the first Lease year, shall pay a full prorata
 share of the real property taxes levied and assessed against the land and
 Improvements of which the leased premises form a part. Without thereby
 waiving Tenant's liability for its entire proportionate share of such
 Taxes due and until Owner receives the next notice of assessment or tax
 bill, Tenant shall pay to Owner, monthly, in advance, as additional rent, 
 an estimated Tax Charge for the first lease year and each subsequent lease
 year, as determined by Owner, as Tenant's share of such Taxes, subject to
 further adjustment when the amount of such Taxes shall be determined.
 Prior to the commencement of the term of this lease, Owner shall estimate
 Tenants Tax Charge payable on and after the date during the first lease
 year and shall notify Tenant of the amount thereof. If the amount of such
 monthly payments paid by Tenant exceeds the actual amount thereafter due,
 the overpayment shall be credited on Tenant's next succeeding payment. If
 the amount of such monthly payments paid by Tenant shall be less than the
 actual amount due, Tenant shall pay to Owner the difference between the
 amount paid by Tenant and Tenant's actual Tax Charge due. If any mortgagee
 or ground lessor of Owner should require real property tax escrow
 deposits, in advance of the due date, then Tenant shall deposit with
 Owner, in advance, its share of such Taxes. Any fiscal tax year or years
 commencing during any lease year hereof shall be deemed to correspond to
 such lease year, except that with respect to the first and last lease
 years of the term of this lease the Taxes for the then current fiscal tax
 year or years and the Taxes payable by Tenant shall be prorated from the
 commencement date and to the end of the last lease year, as to which
 Tenant's obligation shall survive the expiration of the term hereof. Owner
 shall have the right, if permitted by law, to make installment payments of
 any assessments levied against the Shopping Center, and in such event
 Tenant's Taxes shall be computed upon the installments and interest
 thereon paid by Owner in each lease year. Owner shall have the sole,
 absolute and unrestricted right, but not the obligation, to contest the
 validity or amount of the Taxes by Appropriate proceedings, and if Owner
 shall institute any such contest on its own volition, it shall have the
 sole, absolute and unrestricted right to settle any contest, proceeding or
 action upon whatever terms Owner may, in its sole discretion, determine.
 In the event Owner receives any refund or such Taxes (and provided Tenant
 is not then in default of any of the terms of this lease) Owner shall
 credit such proportion of such refund as shall be allocable to payment of
 Taxes actually made by Tenant (less costs, expenses and attorney's fees)
 against the next succeeding payments of Taxes due from Tenant or if
 received during the last lease year Owner will refund the same to Tenant
 within thirty (30) days following the expiration of the Lease Term. Tenant
 acknowledges that the calculation of the estimated Tax Charge is not a
 representation or warranty on the part of Owner as to the actual amount of
 Tenant's Tax Charge and Tenant acknowledges that Tenant has not relied
 thereon in any respect in entering into this lease. Tenant further
 acknowledges that any statement of an estimated Tax Charge provided by
 Owner to Tenant in accordance herewith is solely a means of convenience
 for administrative purposes and that the actual Tax Charge may vary
 substantially therefrom. Tenant's Tax Charge shall be computed and
 determined as a fraction of the total Taxes. The numerator of such
 fraction shall be the Gross Leasable Area of the Demised Premises and the
 denominator of such fraction shall be the Gross Leasable Area in the
 Shopping Center as the same may exist from time to time.

(b)
 With respect to any Taxes for which Tenant is responsible hereunder, a
 copy of an official tax bill submitted by Owner to Tenant shall be
 conclusive evidence of the amount of Taxes assessed or levied, as well as
 the items taxed.
(c)
 In the event of any dispute, Tenant shall pay the Tax Charge (or estimated
 Tax Charge, as the case may be) in accordance with the applicable bill or
 statement, and such payment shall be without prejudice to Tenants
 position. If the dispute shall be decided in the Tenant's favor, by
 agreement or otherwise, Owner shall pay to Tenant the amount of Tenant's
 overpayment resulting from compliance with such bill or statement.

(d)
 Tenant shall pay, in addition to the Rent, Percentage Rent and Additional
 Rent, any Sales Tax assessed thereon.

 SECTION 2.05  Additional Rent.
 The Tenant shall pay as additional rent any money required to be paid
 pursuant to Sections 2.04, 10.01, 12.01, 12.02, 13.01,13.02, 13.04 and
 14.01 and all other sums of money or charges required to be paid by Tenant
 under this lease whether or not the same be designated additional rent. If
 such amounts or charges are not paid at the time provided in this lease,
 they shall nevertheless, if not when due, be collected with the next
 installment of rent thereafter falling due hereunder, but nothing herein
 contained shall be deemed to suspend or delay the payment of any amount of
 money or charge at the time same becomes due and payable hereunder. or
 limit any other remedy of the Owner.

 SECTION 2.06 Past Due Rent and Additional Rent.

 If Tenant shall fail to pay, when the same is due and payable, any rent or
 any additional rent, or amounts or charges of the character described in
 Section 2.05. hereof, such unpaid amounts shall bear interest from the due
 date thereof to the date of
 payment subject to Paragraph   4   in Lease Addendum A.

 SECTION 2.07. Security.  SEE SECTION 8.01
 As security for the payment of all Rent, Tenant hereby grants Owner a
 security interest in the following described collateral: (a) all
 merchandise inventory in the Leased Premises during the Term of this

 pursuant to the Uniform Commercial Code, as enacted in Florida, in form
 satisfactory to Owner and will pay the cost of filing the same in all
 public offices where is deemed necessary or desirable by Owner.
 Upon Default by Tenant under the terms and conditions of this Lease, or
 any time thereafter (such Default not having previously been cured), Owner

 the remedies of a secured party under the laws of the State of Florida, or
 the state in which the Leased Premises are located, including, without
 limitation thereto, the right to take possession of the collateral and for
 that purpose Owner may enter upon the
