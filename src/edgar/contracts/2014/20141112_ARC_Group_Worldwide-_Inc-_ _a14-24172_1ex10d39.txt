WITNESSETH:
 
WHEREAS, the Borrowers have requested that the Lenders extend credit to the 
Borrowers in the form of a Term Loan on the Closing Date in the principal 
amount of $20,000,000.
 
WHEREAS, the proceeds of the Term Loan, will be used (i) on the Closing

and (ii) thereafter, for working capital and general corporate purposes of 
the Borrowers and their respective Subsidiaries from time to time permitted 
under this Agreement (including Permitted Acquisitions), in each case, as 
more fully described in Section 5.21.
 
WHEREAS, each Lender is willing to agree (severally and not jointly) to 
make the Term Loan and provide financial accommodations to the Borrowers on 
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein.
 
NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements 
provided herein, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:
 
ARTICLE I
 
Definitions and Accounting Terms
 
Section 1.01.  Defined Terms.  As used in this Agreement, the following 
terms shall have the meanings set forth below:
 
3D Material has the meaning specified in the introductory paragraph to 
this Agreement.
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Acquisition Consideration means the purchase consideration for any 
Permitted Acquisition and all other payments by the Parent or any of its 
Subsidiaries in exchange for, or as part of any Permitted Acquisition, 
whether paid in cash or by exchange of Equity Interests or of properties or 
otherwise (including by incurrence of Indebtedness, whether or not in favor 
of any seller or affiliate of any seller) and whether payable at or prior 
to the consummation of such Permitted Acquisition or deferred for payment 
at any future time, whether or not any such future payment is subject to 
the occurrence of any contingency, and includes any and all payments 
representing the purchase price and any assumptions of Indebtedness, 
earn-outs and other agreements to make any payment, whether or not the 
amount thereof is, or the terms of payment of which are, in any respect 
subject to or contingent upon the revenues, income, cash flow or profits 
(or the like) of any person or business, but excluding transaction-related 
fees and expenses; and any such future payment shall be considered 
Acquisition Consideration at 100% of the maximum amount thereof if such 
amount is not contingent, or, if such amount is contingent, the amount 
reasonably estimated in good faith by the Parent on the basis of 
assumptions and calculations provided in writing to the Administrative 
Agent.  Such assumptions shall include reasonable projections of any 
measure of financial or other performance that enters into the calculation 
of the amount of any such payment or other consideration but shall not 
include any assumption that any other future event that is a condition to 
such payment or consideration (such as the later disposition of the 
acquired business or a public or private offering of securities) will not 
occur.  Any such amounts payable after the 12-month period following the 
closing of the acquisition shall be calculated on a net present value basis 
discounted at the then current U.S. Treasury rate with a maturity 
substantially the same as the final payment date thereunder.
 
Additional Tranche(s) means an additional advance of Term Loan Commitment 
in an amount not to exceed the principal amount of the Term Loan which has 
been repaid as of the date of such Additional Tranche.

paragraph to this Agreement.
 
Administrative Agents Office means the Administrative Agents address

Affiliate means, with respect to any Person, another Person that

Control means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to 
direct or cause the direction of the management or policies of a Person, 
whether through the ability to exercise voting power, by contract or 
otherwise.  Controlling and Controlled have meanings correlative 
thereto.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Agent or the Lenders or their

the Loan Documents.

the calculation of Consolidated Net Income for such Test Period).

revise its financial statements covering any fiscal quarter ending on a 
date set forth in the table below, Consolidated EBITDA for each applicable 
fiscal quarter ending on a date as set forth in the table below shall be

2.02 below.
 
Section 2.02.  Additional Tranches.  After the Closing Date, so long as no 
Default or Event of Default exists, with the prior written consent of 
Administrative Agent in its sole discretion, the then outstanding principal 
amount of the Term Loan may be increased by an Additional Tranche upon the 
written request of Parent (which such request (a) shall state the
 
32
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
aggregate amount of the Additional Tranche requested, which amount shall 
not exceed the amount of the Term Loan repaid (including any additional 
loan previously made under this Section 2.02) as of the date of such 
request and (b) shall be made at least ten (10) days prior to the proposed 
effective date of the funding of such Additional Tranche) to Administrative 
Agent to activate an Additional Tranche; provided, however, that 
Administrative Agent shall have no obligation to consent to any requested 
activation of an Additional Tranche.  In the event Administrative Agent 
does not consent to the activation of a requested Additional Tranche within 
ten (10) days after receiving a written request from Parent, then the then 
outstanding principal amount of the Term Loan shall not be increased.  Any 
Additional Tranches funded under this Section 2.02 shall be consolidated 
with the then outstanding principal balance of the Term Loan; except, that, 
for the purposes of the application of any payments made in respect of the 
Term Loan, that portion of the Term Loan made on the Closing Date shall be 
deemed to be the first loans repaid, with any Additional Tranches advanced 
under this Section 2.02 be deemed to be the last-out loans repaid.  Each 
Additional Tranche shall have the same interest rate, maturity, and other 
terms as the Term Loan immediately prior to the making of an Additional 
Tranche under this Section 2.02.  Effective immediately upon the making of 
any Additional Tranches under this Section 2.02, all references to the Term 
Loan hereunder shall be automatically amended to include such Additional 
Tranche in the definition of Term Loan.  For the avoidance of doubt, the 
outstanding principal balance of the Term Loan (including the loan made on 
the Closing Date plus all Additional Tranches advanced under this Section 
2.02) shall not exceed at any given time $20,000,000.
 
Section 2.03.  Prepayments.
 
(a)           Optional.
 
    (i)            The Borrowers may, upon not less than thirty (30) days
    prior written notice by the Parent to the Administrative Agent, at any
    time or from time to time voluntarily prepay the Term Loan in whole or
    in part.  Each such notice shall specify the date and amount of such
    prepayment and the payment amount specified in such notice shall be due
    and payable on the date specified therein.  The Administrative Agent
    will promptly notify each Lender of its receipt of each such notice,
    and of the amount of such Lenders Pro Rata Share of such prepayment. 
    Each prepayment of the Term Loan pursuant to this Section 2.03(a) shall
    be paid to the Lenders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata
    Shares, and shall be accompanied by the payment of the Prepayment
    Premium for the account of the Lenders.
     
    (ii)           Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
    this subsection (a), the Parent may rescind any notice of prepayment
    under Section 2.03(a)(i) if such prepayment would have resulted from a
    refinancing of the Term Loan or other transaction, which refinancing or
    transaction shall not be consummated or shall otherwise be delayed.
     
    (iii)          Voluntary prepayments of the Term Loan permitted
    hereunder shall be subject in all events to the terms of the Senior
    Subordination Agreement and shall be applied to the Term Loan then
    outstanding first, to that portion of the Term Loan made

    on the Closing Date and second, to any Additional Tranches advanced
    under Section 2.02.
     
(b)           Mandatory.
 
    (i)            [Reserved].
     
    (ii)           [Reserved].
     
    (iii)          Subject to the terms of the Senior Subordination
    Agreement, on the fifth Business Day after the date of any Asset Sale
    by the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, the Borrowers will prepay the
    Term Loan hereunder in an aggregate amount equal to 100% of the amount
    of Net Cash Proceeds from such Asset Sale received by the Parent or any
    of its Subsidiaries on the date of such Asset Sale.  Notwithstanding
    the foregoing, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is
    continuing, the Borrowers shall not be required to make any prepayment
    of the Term Loan under this Section 2.03(b)(iii) with respect to Net
    Cash Proceeds received by the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries from
    Asset Sales to the extent that, on or prior to the date such Net Cash
    Proceeds would otherwise be required to be so applied the Parent
    notifies the Administrative Agent that such Net Cash Proceeds are to be
    reinvested in assets used or usable in the business of the Parent or
    any of its Subsidiaries within 180 days of each such Asset Sale, and if
    such Net Cash Proceeds to be reinvested are not in fact reinvested
    within 180 days after receipt thereof, then such proceeds shall be due
    and payable, and, in each case, applied to the prepayment of the Term
    Loan as provided in this clause (iii) at the expiration of such 180-day
    period); provided that the amount of such Net Cash Proceeds not applied
    to prepayment of the Term Loan because of this sentence shall not
    exceed $1,000,000 over the term of this Agreement.
     
    (iv)          Subject to the terms of the Senior Subordination
    Agreement, on the fifth Business Day after any incurrence of
    Indebtedness by the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (other than
    Indebtedness expressly permitted pursuant to Section 7.03), the
    Borrowers will prepay the Term Loan hereunder in an aggregate amount
    equal to 100% of the amount of the Net Cash Proceeds from such
    incurrence of Indebtedness received by the Parent or any of its
    Subsidiaries.
     
    (v)           Subject to the terms of the Senior Subordination
    Agreement, on the fifth Business Day after the closing of any offering
    or sale of Equity Interests by or any capital contribution to the
    Parent (other than any Excluded Contribution), the Borrowers will
    prepay the Term Loan hereunder in an aggregate amount equal to 100% of
    the Net Cash Proceeds from such offering or sale of Equity Interests
    after satisfaction of the mandatory prepayment requirement set forth in
    Section 2.03(b)(v) in the Senior Loan Agreement provided that (x) if
    the Senior Leverage Ratio is less than 2.75 to 1.00 but greater than or
    equal to 2.25 to 1.00 without giving effect to such issuance and the
    application of the proceeds thereof for the period of four consecutive
    quarters most recently ended and for which financial statements are
    required to have been delivered pursuant to Section 6.01(a) or (b), the
    Borrowers will prepay the Term Loan hereunder in an aggregate amount
    equal to 25% of the Net Cash Proceeds from such offering or sale of
    Equity
 
34
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
    Interests after satisfaction of the mandatory prepayment requirement
    set forth in Section 2.03(b)(v) in the Senior Loan Agreement and (y) if
    the Senior Leverage Ratio is less than 2.25 to 1.00 without giving
    effect to such issuance and the application of the proceeds thereof for
    the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters most recently ended and
    for which financial statements are required to have been delivered
    pursuant to Section 6.01(a) and (b), the Borrowers will prepay the Term
    Loan hereunder in an aggregate amount equal to 50% of the Net Cash
    Proceeds from such offering or sale of Equity Interests remaining after
    satisfaction of the mandatory prepayment requirement set forth in
    Section 2.03(b)(v) in the Senior Loan Agreement.  Notwithstanding the
    foregoing, the Borrowers will make such prepayments in respect of any
    Net Cash Proceeds constituting a Cure Amount in an amount equal to 100%
    of such Net Cash Proceeds.
     
    (vi)          Subject to the terms of the Senior Subordination
    Agreement, on the tenth Business Day after the receipt by the Parent or
    any of its Subsidiaries of the proceeds of insurance, condemnation
    award or other compensation (other than business interruption insurance
    proceeds) in respect of any Casualty Event affecting any property or
    assets of the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, the Borrowers shall
    prepay the Term Loan in an aggregate amount equal to 100% of the Net
    Cash Proceeds from such Casualty Event, provided that the Borrowers
    shall not be required to make any prepayment of the Term Loan under
    this Section 2.03(b)(vi) with respect to Net Cash Proceeds received by
    any Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries from Casualty Events to the
    extent if, at the time proceeds of insurance, condemnation award or
    other compensation (other than business interruption insurance
    proceeds) in respect of such Casualty Event are received, no Event of
    Default shall have occurred and be continuing, to the extent that, on
    or prior to the date such Net Cash Proceeds would otherwise be required
    to be so applied the Parent notifies the Administrative Agent that such
    Net Cash Proceeds from such Casualty Event are to be reinvested in the
    repair, restoration or replacement of the property affected by such
    Casualty Event or in other assets used or usable in the business of the
    Borrowers and their Subsidiaries within 180 days of the receipt of such
    proceeds, and if such Net Cash Proceeds intended to be reinvested are
    not in fact reinvested then such proceeds shall be due and payable and
    applied to the prepayment of the Term Loan as provided in this clause
    (v) at the expiration of such 180-day period).
     
    (vii)         Subject to the terms of the Senior Subordination

    pursuant to Section 6.01(a), if the Total Leverage Ratio is greater
    than or equal to 2.00 to 1.00 for the Test Period ending on the last
    day of such fiscal year, the Borrowers will prepay the Term Loan
    hereunder in an aggregate amount equal to 75% (or if the Total Leverage
    Ratio is less than 2.50 to 1.00 but greater than or equal to 2.00 to
    1.00 for the Test Period ending on the last day of such fiscal year,
    50%) of the Excess Cash Flow for such fiscal year (or, in the case of
    the prepayment under this clause (vii) for the period ending on June
    30, 2015, for the period of two consecutive fiscal quarters ending on
    such date) minus the aggregate amount of voluntary prepayments of the
    Term Loan.
     
    (viii)        Subject in all events to the terms of the Senior
    Subordination Agreement, (A) each prepayment of the Term Loan pursuant
    to this Section 2.03(b) shall be applied
 
35
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
    to the Term Loan then outstanding (and applied pro rata to the
    remaining installments thereof in inverse order of maturity), and (B)
    each such prepayment shall be paid to the Lenders in accordance with
    their respective Pro Rata Shares of such prepayment, and shall be
    accompanied by the payment of the Prepayment Premium for the account of
    the Lenders; provided that, (1) solely in the case of a prepayment
    pursuant to Section 2.03(b)(v), the Prepayment Premium with respect to
    prepayments of the first $1 through $5,000,000 of the Term Loan with
    such proceeds shall equal 0% of such prepayments up to $5,000,000, and
    any prepayments greater than $5,000,000 made pursuant to Section
    2.03(b)(v) shall be subject to the otherwise applicable Prepayment
    Premium required hereunder, (2) in the case of a prepayment pursuant to
    Section 2.03(b)(vii), no Prepayment Premium shall be required, and (3)
    any prepayment of an Additional Tranche shall not be subject to the
    Prepayment Premium.
     
(c)           The Parent shall notify the Administrative Agent in writing 
of any mandatory prepayment of the Term Loan required to be made pursuant 
to Section 2.03(b)(iii) through (vii) at least two (2) Business Days prior 
to the required date of such prepayment.  Each such notice shall specify 
the date of such prepayment and provide a reasonably detailed calculation 
of the amount of such prepayment.  The Administrative Agent will promptly 
notify each applicable Lender of the contents of the Parents prepayment 
notice and of such Lenders Pro Rata Share or other applicable share of the 
prepayment.
 
(d)           Interest, Funding Losses, etc.  All prepayments under this 
Section 2.03 shall be accompanied by all accrued interest thereon.
 
Section 2.04.  [Reserved].
 
Section 2.05.  Repayment of the Term Loan.  Subject to the terms of the 
Senior Subordination Agreement, the principal amount of the Term Loan, 
together with interest accrued thereon, shall be due and payable on the 
Maturity Date or, if earlier, on the date on which they are declared due 
and payable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.
 
Section 2.06.  Interest.
 
(a)           The Term Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding 
principal amount thereof from the Closing Date at a rate per annum equal to 
the Applicable Rate.  Said interest shall be payable to Agent for the 
benefit of each Lender quarterly in arrears in immediately available funds 
on the first (1st) day of each fiscal quarter beginning on January 1, 2015.
 
(b)           If any amount of principal of the Term Loan is not paid when 
due (without regard to any applicable grace periods), whether at stated 
maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, such amount shall thereafter bear 
interest at the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable 
Laws.
 
    (i)            If any amount (other than principal or interest of the
    Term Loan) payable by any Borrower under the Loan Documents is not paid
    when due (without regard to any applicable grace periods), whether at
    stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, then upon the request of
    the Person to whom such amount is owed, such amount shall
 
36
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
    thereafter bear interest at the Default Rate to the fullest extent
    permitted by applicable Laws.
     
    (ii)           While any Event of Default exists, upon the request of
    the Required Lenders, the Borrowers shall pay interest on the principal
    amount of all outstanding Obligations hereunder at the Default Rate to
    the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws.
     
(c)           Interest payments shall be payable to Agent for the benefit 
of each Lender based on their Pro Rata Share.  Interest hereunder shall be 
due and payable in accordance with the terms hereof before and after 
judgment, and before and after the commencement of any proceeding under any 
Debtor Relief Law.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent any such 
cash interest payments are prohibited to be paid in cash when due pursuant 
to the terms of the Senior Subordination Agreement, such interest shall 
continue to accrue and shall bear interest at the same rate and in the same 
manner as the underlying Obligations for which such interest was originally 
accrued and shall be payable in full as of the date such payment ceases to 
be prohibited under the Senior Subordination Agreement.
 
Section 2.07.  Fees.
 
(a)           The Borrowers shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the 
ratable benefit of the Lenders an underwriting fee in an amount equal to 2% 
of the aggregate Term Loan Commitment on the Closing Date.  The Borrowers 
shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the ratable benefit of the 
Lenders funding such Additional Tranche a fee equal to 2% of the Additional 
Tranche contemporaneously with the funding of an Additional Tranche.
 
(b)           The Borrowers shall pay to the Administrative Agent such fees 
as shall have been separately agreed upon in writing in the amounts and at 
the times so specified.  Such fees shall be fully earned when paid and 
shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever.
 
(c)           All fees shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately 
available funds in Dollars, to the Administrative Agent for distribution, 
if and as appropriate, among the Lenders.  Once paid, none of the Fees 
shall be refundable under any circumstances.
 
Section 2.08.  Computation of Interest and Fees.  All computations of 
interest shall be made on the basis of a 360 day year and actual number of 
days elapsed.  Interest shall accrue on the Term Loan from the day on which 
the Term Loan is made until the day on which the Term Loan or any portion 
is repaid.  Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest 
rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, 
absent manifest or demonstrable error.
 
Section 2.09.  Evidence of Indebtedness.
 
(a)           The Term Loan made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one 
or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender and evidenced by one 
or more entries in the Register maintained by the Administrative Agent, 
acting solely for purposes of Treasury Regulation Section 5f.103-l(c), as 
non-fiduciary agent for the Borrowers, in each case in the ordinary course 
of business.  The accounts or records maintained by the Administrative 
Agent and each Lender
 
37
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
shall be prima facie evidence absent manifest or demonstrable error of the 
amount of the Term Loan made by the Lenders to the Borrowers and the 
interest and payments thereon.  Any failure to so record or any error in 
doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of 
the Borrowers hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the 
Obligations.  In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records 
maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the Administrative 
Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the 
Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest or 
demonstrable error.  Upon the request of any Lender made through the 
Administrative Agent, the Borrowers shall execute and deliver to such 
Lender (through the Administrative Agent) a Note payable to such Lender, 
which shall evidence such Lenders Term Loan in addition to such accounts 
or records.
 
(b)           Entries made in good faith by the Administrative Agent in the 
Register pursuant to Section 2.09(a), and by each Lender in its account or 
accounts pursuant to Section 2.09(a), shall be prima facie evidence of the 
amount of principal and interest due and payable or to become due and 
payable from the Borrowers to, in the case of the Register, each Lender 
and, in the case of such account or accounts, such Lender, under this 
Agreement and the other Loan Documents, absent manifest or demonstrable 
error; provided that the failure of the Administrative Agent or such Lender 
to make an entry, or any finding that an entry is incorrect, in the 
Register or such account or accounts shall not limit or otherwise affect 
the obligations of the Borrowers under this Agreement and the other Loan 
Documents.
 
Section 2.10.  Payments Generally.
 
(a)           All payments to be made by the Borrowers shall be made 
without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or 
setoff.  Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the 
Borrowers hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the 
account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the 
applicable Administrative Agents Office for payment and in Same Day Funds 
not later than 2:00 p.m. on the date specified herein.  The Administrative 
Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its Pro Rata Share (or other 
applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as 
received by wire transfer to such Lenders Lending Office.  All payments 
received by the Administrative Agent shall in each case be deemed received 
on the Business Day so received (or, if received after 2:00 p.m. New York, 
New York time, the succeeding Business Day) and any applicable interest or 
fee shall continue to accrue, but in each case will be credited to the 
account of the applicable Borrower on the following Business Day.
 
(b)           If any payment to be made by the Borrowers shall come due on 
a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next 
following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in 
computing interest or fees, as the case may be.
 
(c)           Whenever any payment received by the Administrative Agent 
under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents is insufficient to 
pay in full all amounts due and payable to the Administrative Agent and the 
Lenders under or in respect of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents 
on any date, such payment shall be distributed by the Administrative Agent 
and applied by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in the order of 
priority set forth in Section 8.03.  If the Administrative Agent receives 
funds for application to the Obligations of the Loan Parties under or in 
respect of the Loan Documents under circumstances for which the
 
38
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Loan Documents do not specify the manner in which such funds are to be 
applied, the Administrative Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, elect 
to distribute such funds to each of the Lenders in accordance with such 
Lenders Pro Rata Share of such of the outstanding Term Loan or other 
Obligations then owing to such Lender.
 
Section 2.11.  Sharing of Payments, etc.  If, other than as expressly 
provided elsewhere herein, any Lender shall obtain payment in respect of 
any principal of or interest on account of the Term Loan made by it 
(whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of 
setoff, or otherwise) in excess of its ratable share (or other share 
contemplated hereunder) thereof, such Lender shall immediately (a) notify 
the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase from the other 
Lenders such participations in the Term Loan made by them as shall be 
necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment of 
principal of or interest on such Term Loan, pro rata with each of them; 
provided that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter 
recovered from the purchasing Lender under any of the circumstances 
described in Section 10.06 (including pursuant to any settlement entered 
into by the purchasing Lender in its discretion), such purchase shall to 
that extent be rescinded and each other Lender shall repay to the 
purchasing Lender the purchase price paid therefor, together with an amount 
equal to such paying Lenders ratable share (according to the proportion of 
(i) the amount of such paying Lenders required repayment to (ii) the total 
amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other 
amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total 
amount so recovered, without further interest thereon.  For avoidance of 
doubt, the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to 
(A) any payment made by a Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the 
express terms of this Agreement as in effect from time to time or (B) any 
payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale 
of a participation in any of its Term Loan to any assignee or participant 
permitted hereunder.  The Borrowers agree that any Lender so purchasing a 
participation from another Lender may, to the fullest extent permitted by 
applicable Law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of 
setoff, but subject to Section 10.09) with respect to such participation as 
fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrowers in the 
amount of such participation.  The Administrative Agent will keep records 
(which shall be conclusive and binding in the absence of manifest or 
demonstrable error) of participations purchased under this Section 2.11 and 
will in each case notify the Lenders following any such purchases or 
repayments.  Each Lender that purchases a participation pursuant to this 
Section 2.11 shall from and after such purchase have the right to give all 
notices, requests, demands, directions and other communications under this 
Agreement with respect to the portion of the Obligations purchased to the 
same extent as though the purchasing Lender were the original owner of the 
Obligations purchased.

Section 2.16.  Obligations of the Borrowers; Appointment of the Parent as 
Agent.
 
(a)           The Obligations of all Borrowers shall be joint and several 
in nature.
 
(b)           Each Borrower hereby irrevocably appoints the Parent as its 
agent for all purposes relevant to this Agreement and each of the other 
Loan Documents, including (i) the giving and receipt of notices, (ii) the 
execution and delivery of all documents, instruments and certificates 
contemplated herein and all modifications hereto, and (iii) the receipt of 
the proceeds of the Term Loan made by the Lenders to any such Borrower 
hereunder.  Any acknowledgment, consent, direction, certification or other 
action which might otherwise be valid or effective only if given or taken 
by all Borrowers, or by any Borrower acting singly, shall be valid and 
effective if given or taken only by the Parent, whether or not any such 
other Borrower joins therein. Any notice, demand, consent, acknowledgement, 
direction, certification or other communication delivered to the Parent in 
accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been 
delivered to each Borrower.
 
ARTICLE III
 
Taxes, Increased Costs Protection and Illegality
 
Section 3.01.  Taxes.  For the purposes of this Section 3.01, the term 
applicable law includes FATCA.
 
(a)           Except as required by applicable law, any and all payments by 
any Loan Party to or for the account of any Agent or any Lender under the 
Loan Documents shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for 
any and all present or future taxes, duties, levies, imposts, deductions, 
assessments, fees, withholdings or similar charges, and all liabilities 
(including additions to tax, penalties and interest) with respect thereto 
(Taxes).  If any applicable law (as determined in the good faith 
discretion of an applicable withholding agent) requires an applicable 
withholding agent to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable 
by a Loan Party under the Loan Documents to any Agent or any Lender, (i) if 
such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, the sum payable by any Loan Party shall be 
increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions 
(including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this 
Section 3.01(a)), each of such Agent and such Lender receives an amount 
equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, 
(ii) the applicable withholding agent shall make such deductions, and (iii) 
the applicable withholding agent shall pay the full amount deducted to the 
relevant taxing authority.  Within thirty (30) days after the date of the 
payment of Taxes by any Loan Party to a Governmental Authority pursuant to 
this Section 3.01 (or, if receipts or evidence are not available within 
thirty (30) days, as soon as practicable thereafter), any Loan Party shall 
furnish to the Administrative Agent the original or a facsimile copy of a 
receipt evidencing payment thereof to the extent such a receipt has been 
made available to any Loan Party (or other evidence of payment reasonably 
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent).  If a Loan Party fails to pay 
any Indemnified Taxes when due to the appropriate taxing authority or fails 
to remit to any Agent or any Lender the required receipts or other required 
documentary evidence that has been made available to any Loan Party, any 
Loan Party shall indemnify such Agent and such Lender for any incremental 
Taxes that may become payable by such Agent or such Lender arising out of 
such failure.

(b)           Each Lender (including an Eligible Assignee to which a Lender 
assigns its interest in accordance with Section 10.07) that is not a 
United States person within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the 
Code (each a Foreign Lender) agrees to complete and deliver to the 
Borrowers and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which 
such Foreign Lender (or Eligible Assignee) becomes a party hereto and at 
the time or times prescribed by applicable Law, two (2) accurate, complete 
and original signed copies of whichever of the following is applicable:  
(i) IRS Form W-8BEN certifying that it is entitled to benefits under an 
income tax treaty to which the United States is a party; (ii) IRS Form 
W-ECI certifying that the income receivable pursuant to the Loan Documents 
is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the 
United States; (iii) if the Foreign Lender is not (A) a bank described in 
Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (B) a 10-percent shareholder described in 
Section 871(h)(3)(B) of the Code, and (C) a controlled foreign corporation 
related to any Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the 
Code, a certificate to that effect in substantially the form attached 
hereto as Exhibit E-1, E-2, E-3 or E-4, as applicable (a Non-Bank 
Certificate) and an IRS Form W-8BEN, certifying that the Foreign Lender is 
not a United States person; (iv) to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the 
beneficial owner for U.S. federal income tax purposes, IRS Form W-8IMY (or 
any successor forms) of the Foreign Lender, accompanied by, as and to the 
extent applicable, a Form W-8BEN, Form W-ECI, Non-Bank Certificate, Form 
W-9 (or other successor forms) and any other required supporting 
information from each beneficial owner (it being understood that a Foreign 
Lender need not provide certificates or supporting documentation from 
beneficial owners if such Foreign Lender is able to establish, and does 
establish, to the reasonable satisfaction of the Parent and the 
Administrative Agent that payments to such Foreign Lender are, to the 
extent applicable, entitled to an exemption from or, if an exemption is not 
available, a reduction in the rate of, U.S. federal withholding taxes 
without providing such certificates or supporting documentation); or (v) 
any other form prescribed by applicable requirements of U.S. federal income 
tax law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. 
federal withholding tax duly completed together with such supplementary 
documentation as may be prescribed by applicable requirements of law to 
permit the Parent and the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding 
or deduction required to be made.  Each Foreign Lender agrees that if any 
form or certification it previously delivered pursuant to this paragraph 
(b) expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall 
update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the 
Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.
 
(c)           In addition, each such Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it 
is legally entitled to do so, (i) promptly submit to the Parent and the 
Administrative Agent two (2) accurate, complete and original signed copies 
of such other or additional forms or certificates (or such successor forms 
or certificates as shall be adopted from time to time by the relevant 
taxing authorities) as may then be applicable or available to secure an 
exemption from or reduction in the rate of, or to determine the withholding 
or deduction required to be made on account of, U.S. federal withholding 
tax (A) on or before the date that such Foreign Lenders most recently 
delivered form, certificate or other evidence expires or becomes obsolete 
or inaccurate in any material respect (or promptly notifies the Parent and 
Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so), (B) after 
the occurrence of a change in the Foreign Lenders circumstances requiring 
a change in the most recent form, certificate or evidence previously 
delivered by it to the Parent and the Administrative Agent, and (C) from 
time to time thereafter if reasonably requested by a Borrower or the 
Administrative Agent, and (ii) promptly notify the Parent and the 
Administrative
 
41
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Agent of any change in the Foreign Lenders circumstances which would 
modify or render invalid any claimed exemption or reduction.
 
(d)           Each Lender that is a United States person (within the 
meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) (each a U.S. Lender) agrees 
to complete and deliver to the Parent and the Administrative Agent two (2) 
original copies of accurate, complete and signed IRS Form W-9 or successor 
form certifying that such U.S. Lender is not subject to United States 
backup withholding tax (i) on or prior to the Closing Date (or on or prior 
to the date it becomes a party to this Agreement), (ii) on or before the 
date that such form expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any 
material respect (or promptly notifies the Parent and Administrative Agent 
in writing of its legal inability to do so), (iii) after the occurrence of 
a change in such U.S. Lenders circumstances requiring a change in the most 
recent form previously delivered by it to the Parent and the Administrative 
Agent, and (iv) from time to time thereafter if reasonably requested by the 
Parent or the Administrative Agent.
 
(e)           The Loan Parties agree to timely pay any and all present or 
future stamp, court or documentary taxes and any other excise, property, 
intangible or mortgage recording taxes or charges or similar levies which 
arise from any payment made under the Loan Documents or from the execution, 
delivery, performance, enforcement or registration of, or otherwise with 
respect to, the Loan Documents (including additions to tax, penalties and 
interest related thereto) (all such non-excluded taxes described in this 
Section 3.01(e) being hereinafter referred to as Other Taxes).
 
(f)            If claims for any Indemnified Taxes are paid or payable by 
any Agent or Lender with respect to any payment received by such Agent or 
Lender in respect of the Loan Documents, such Agent or Lender may pay such 
Indemnified Taxes and the Loan Parties will promptly jointly and severally 
indemnify and hold harmless such Agent or Lender for the full amount of 
such Indemnified Taxes (and any Indemnified Taxes imposed on amounts 
payable under this Section 3.01), and any reasonable expenses arising 
therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes 
were correctly or legally imposed or asserted.  Payments under this Section 
3.01(f) shall be made within ten (10) days after the date the Parent 
receives written demand for payment from such Agent or Lender.  A 
certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the 
Parent by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the 
Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be 
conclusive absent manifest error.
 
(g)           Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative 
Agent for any and all Taxes (but, in the case of any Indemnified Taxes, 
only to the extent that the Borrowers have not already indemnified the 
Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the 
obligation of the Borrowers to do so) attributable to such Lender or 
attributable to such Lenders failure to comply with Section 10.07(e) 
relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register that are paid or 
payable by the Administrative Agent in connection with the Loan Documents 
and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, 
whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by 
the relevant Governmental Authority.  The indemnity under this Section 
3.01(g) shall be paid within ten (10) days after the Administrative Agent 
delivers to the applicable Lender a certificate stating the amount of taxes 
so paid or payable by the Administrative Agent.  Such certificate shall be 
conclusive of the
 
42
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
amount so paid or payable absent manifest error.  Each Lender hereby 
authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all 
amounts at any time owing to such Lender under the Loan Documents or 
otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other 
source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this 
paragraph (g).
 
(h)           If a payment made to a Lender under the Loan Documents would 
be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender 
were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA 
(including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as 
applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Parent and the Administrative 
Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times 
reasonably requested by the Parent or the Administrative Agent such 
documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by 
Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation 
reasonably requested by the Parent or the Administrative Agent as may be 
necessary for the Parent and the Administrative Agent to comply with their 
obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with 
such Lenders obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct 
and withhold from such payment.  Solely for purposes of this clause (D), 
FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this 
Agreement.
 
(i)            If any Agent or any Lender determines, in its sole 
discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund in 
respect of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrowers, 
or with respect to which the Borrowers have paid additional amounts 
pursuant to this Section 3.01, it shall promptly remit such refund (but 
only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, 
by the Borrowers under this Section 3.01 with respect to the Taxes giving 
rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the 
Administrative Agent or such Lender and without interest (other than any 
interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such 
refund), provided that the Borrowers, upon the request of the 
Administrative Agent or such Lender, agree to repay the amount paid over to 
the Borrowers (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the 
relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender 
in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay 
such refund to such Governmental Authority.  Notwithstanding anything to 
the contrary in this paragraph (i), in no event will the indemnified party 
be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this 
paragraph (i) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a 
less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have 
been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such 
refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the 
indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had 
never been paid.  The Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may 
be, shall provide the Parent with a copy of any notice of assessment or 
other evidence reasonably available of the requirement to repay such refund 
received from the relevant Governmental Authority (provided that such 
Lender or the Administrative Agent may delete any information therein that 
such Lender or the Administrative Agent deems confidential in its sole 
discretion).  This subsection shall not be construed to require the 
Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its Tax returns (or 
any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to 
the Borrowers or any other Person.
 
43
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
(j)            The agreements in this Section 3.01 shall survive the 
resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of 
rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of this 
Agreement and the payment of the Term Loan and all other amounts payable 
hereunder.
 
Section 3.02.  [Reserved].
 
Section 3.03.  [Reserved].
 
Section 3.04.  Increased Cost and Reduced Return; Capital Adequacy.
 
(a)           Increased Costs Generally.  If any Change in Law shall 
impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory 
loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits 
with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any 
Lender, and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the 
cost to such Lender, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or 
receivable by such Lender (whether of principal, interest or any other 
amount) then from time to time upon written demand of such Lender setting 
forth in reasonable detail the charge and the calculation of such 
additional costs or reduction suffered (with a copy of such demand to the 
Administrative Agent), the Borrowers will pay to such Lender such 
additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such 
additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
 
(b)           Capital Requirements.  If any Lender determines that any 
Change in Law affecting such Lender or any Lending Office of such Lender or 
such Lenders holding company, if any, regarding capital requirements has 
or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lenders 
capital or on the capital of such Lenders holding company, if any, as a 
consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Term 
Loan made by it to a level below that which such Lender or such Lenders 
holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into 
consideration such Lenders policies and the policies of such Lenders 
holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time 
upon demand of such Lender setting forth in reasonable detail the charge 
and the calculation of such reduced rate of return (with a copy of such 
demand to the Administrative Agent), the Borrowers will pay to such Lender, 
as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate 
such Lender or such Lenders holding company for any such reduction 
suffered.
 
(c)           Certificates for Reimbursement.  A certificate of a Lender 
setting forth, in reasonable detail, the calculation of the amount or 
amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the 
case may be, as specified in subsection (a) or (b) of this Section 3.04 and 
delivered to the Borrowers shall be conclusive absent manifest or 
demonstrable error.  The Borrowers shall pay such Lender, as the case may 
be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within fifteen (15) 
days after receipt thereof.
 
(d)           Delay in Requests.  Failure or delay on the part of any 
Lender to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this 
Section 3.04 shall not constitute a waiver of such Lenders right to demand 
such compensation, provided that the Borrowers shall not be required to 
compensate a Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 
3.04 for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than one 
hundred and eighty (180)
 
44
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
days prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrowers of the 
Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such 
Lenders intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the 
Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is 
retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to 
include the period of retroactive effect thereof).
 
Section 3.05.  [Reserved].
 
Section 3.06.  Matters Applicable to All Requests for Compensation.
 
(a)           Designation of a Different Lending Office.  If any Lender 
requests compensation under Section 3.04, or the Borrowers are required to 
pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for 
the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.01, or if any Lender gives 
a notice pursuant to Section 3.02, then such Lender shall use reasonable 
efforts to designate a different Lending Office for funding or booking its 
Term Loan hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to 
another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such 
Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce 
amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.01 or 3.04, as the case may be, in 
the future, or eliminate the need for the notice pursuant to Section 3.02, 
as applicable, and (ii) in each case, would not subject such Lender to any 
material unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be 
disadvantageous to such Lender in any material economic, legal or 
regulatory respect.
 
(b)           [Reserved].
 
Section 3.07.  Replacement of Lenders under Certain Circumstances.  If (i) 
the Borrowers are required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or 
any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to 
Section 3.01, or (ii) any Lender is a Non-Consenting Lender (as defined 
below), then the Borrowers may, at their sole expense and effort, upon 
notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such 
Non-Consenting Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in 
accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents 
required by, Section 10.07), all of its interests, rights and obligations 
under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to one or more Eligible 
Assignees that shall assume such obligations (any of which assignee may be 
another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment), provided that:
 
(a)           the Administrative Agent shall have received the assignment 
fee specified in Section 10.07(b)(iv), if any;
 
(b)           such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to 
the outstanding principal of its Term Loan, accrued interest thereon, 
accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the 
other Loan Documents (including any amounts under Section 3.05) from the 
assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest 
and fees) or the Borrowers (in the case of all other amounts);
 
(c)           such Lender being replaced pursuant to this Section 3.07 
shall (i) execute and deliver an Assignment and Assumption with respect to 
such Lenders Commitment and outstanding Term Loan, and (ii) deliver any 
Notes evidencing such Term Loan to the Borrowers or Administrative Agent 
(or a lost or destroyed note indemnity in lieu thereof); provided that the
 
45
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
failure of any such Lender to execute an Assignment and Assumption or 
deliver such Notes shall not render such sale and purchase (and the 
corresponding assignment) invalid and such assignment shall be recorded in 
the Register and the Notes shall be deemed to be canceled upon such 
failure;
 
(d)           the Eligible Assignee shall become a Lender hereunder (if not 
already a Lender hereunder) and the assigning Lender shall cease to 
constitute a Lender hereunder with respect to such assigned Term Loan, 
Commitments and participations, except with respect to indemnification 
provisions under this Agreement, which shall survive as to such assigning 
Lender;
 
(e)           in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for 
compensation under Section 3.04 or payments required to be made pursuant to 
Section 3.01, such assignment will result in a reduction in such 
compensation or payments thereafter; and
 
(f)            such assignment does not conflict with applicable Laws.
 
In the event that (i) a Borrower or the Administrative Agent has requested 
that the Lenders consent to a departure or waiver of any provisions of the 
Loan Documents or agree to any amendment thereto, (ii) the consent, waiver 
or amendment in question requires the agreement of each Lender, all 
affected Lenders or all the Lenders or all affected Lenders with respect to 
the Term Loan and (iii) the Required Lenders have agreed to such consent, 
waiver or amendment, then any Lender who does not agree to such consent, 
waiver or amendment shall be deemed a Non-Consenting Lender.
 
A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation 
if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the 
circumstances entitling the Borrowers to require such assignment and 
delegation cease to apply.
 
Section 3.08.  Survival.  All of the Borrowers obligations under this 
Article III shall survive termination of the Aggregate Commitments, 
repayment of all other Obligations hereunder and resignation of the 
Administrative Agent.
 
ARTICLE IV

ARTICLE V
 
Representations and Warranties
 
The Borrowers represent and warrant to the Administrative Agent and the 
Lenders that:
 
Section 5.01.  Existence, Qualification and Power; Compliance with Laws and 
Business.  Each Loan Party (a) is a Person duly organized or formed, 
validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of 
its incorporation or organization (to the extent such concept exists in 
such jurisdiction), (b) has all corporate or other organizational power and

Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and is not released, vacated or fully 
bonded within sixty (60) days after its issue or levy; or
 
(h)           Judgments.  There is entered against any Loan Party or any 
Subsidiary a final judgment or order for the payment of money in an

independent third-party insurance as to which the insurer has been notified 
of such judgment or order and has not denied coverage thereof) and such

days; or
 
(i)            ERISA.  (i) An ERISA Event occurs with respect to a Pension 
Plan or Multiemployer Plan which has resulted or would reasonably be

that could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, 
or
 
(j)            Invalidity of Loan Documents.  Subject to the terms of the

(other than as expressly permitted hereunder or thereunder including as a 
result of a transaction permitted under Section 7.04 or 7.05, and subject 
to the Senior Subordination Agreement) or the satisfaction in full of all 
the Obligations, ceases to be in full force and effect; or any Loan Party 
contests in writing the validity or enforceability of any provision of the 
Loan Documents; or any Loan Party denies in writing that it has any or 
further liability or obligation under the Loan Documents (other than as a 
result of repayment in full of the Obligations), or purports in writing to 
revoke or rescind the Loan Documents; or
 
(k)           Change of Control.  There occurs any Change of Control.

occurs and is continuing, the Administrative Agent may with the consent of, 
and shall at the request of, the Required Lenders take any or all of the 
following actions;
 
(a)           declare the Commitments of each Lender to be terminated, 
whereupon such Commitments and obligation shall be terminated;
 
(b)           declare the unpaid principal amount of the Term Loan, all 
interest accrued and unpaid thereon, and all other amounts owing or payable 
hereunder or under any other Loan Document to be immediately due and 
payable, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind,

Loan Party; and
 
(c)           exercise on behalf of itself and the Lenders all rights and 
remedies available to it and the Lenders under the Loan Documents or 
applicable Law;
 
provided that upon the occurrence of an actual or deemed entry of an order 
for relief with respect to any Borrower under the Bankruptcy Code of the 
United States, the Commitments of each Lender shall automatically 
terminate, the unpaid principal amount of the Term Loan and all interest 
and other amounts as aforesaid shall automatically become due and payable, 
in each case without further act of the Administrative Agent or any Lender.
 
Section 8.03.  Application of Funds.  After the exercise of remedies 
provided for in Section 8.02 (or after the Term Loan has automatically 
become immediately due and payable as set forth in the proviso to Section

by the Administrative Agent in the following order (subject to the terms of 
the Senior Subordination Agreement):

    indemnities, expenses and other amounts (other than principal and

    amounts payable under Article III) payable to the Administrative Agent
    in its capacity as such;
     
    Second, to payment of that portion of the Obligations constituting

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 

 
    Fifth, to the payment of all other Obligations of the Loan Parties that
    are due and payable to the Administrative Agent and the other Lenders
    on such date, ratably based upon the respective aggregate amounts of
    all such Obligations owing to the Administrative Agent and the other
    Lenders on such date; and
     
    Last, the balance, if any, after all of the Obligations have been
    indefeasibly paid in full, to the Borrowers or as otherwise required by
    Law.
     
Section 8.04.  Equity Cure.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary 
contained in this Article 8, if the Borrowers fail to comply with the 
requirement of any financial covenants set forth in Section 7.14, the 
Borrowers shall have the right to cure such failure (the Cure Right), by 
notice to the Administrative Agent not later than the date on which the 
applicable Compliance Certificate is required to be delivered pursuant to 
Section 6.01 for the period for which such financial covenants are being 
measured, to cause the net cash proceeds of an issuance of Equity Interests 
(other than Disqualified Equity Interests) by the Parent to be contributed 
in cash to the common equity to a Borrower, all not later than the tenth 
Business Day following the date of such notice and upon receipt by such 
Borrower of such cash contribution (such cash amount actually received by 
the Borrowers being referred to as the Cure Amount) pursuant to the 
exercise of such Cure Right, each such financial covenant shall be 
recalculated giving effect to the following pro forma adjustments:
 
(a)           Consolidated EBITDA shall be deemed to be increased, solely 
for the purpose of calculation of the financial covenants set forth in 
Section 7.14 with respect to any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters 
that includes the fiscal quarter for which the Cure Right was exercised and 
not for any other purpose under this Agreement, by an amount equal to the 
Cure Amount; and
 
(b)           if, after giving effect to the foregoing recalculations, the 
Borrowers shall then be in compliance with the requirements of the 
financial covenants set forth in Section 7.14, the Borrowers shall be 
deemed to have satisfied the requirements of the financial covenants set 
forth in Section 7.14 as of the relevant date of determination with the 
same effect as though there had been no failure to comply therewith at such 
date, and the applicable breach or default of such financial covenants that 
had occurred shall be deemed cured for the purposes of this Agreement; 
provided that (i) Cure Rights shall not be exercised in more than two 
consecutive fiscal quarters, (ii) there shall be a maximum of two Cure 
Rights exercised in any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters, and a 
maximum of four Cure Rights exercised during the term of this Agreement,

disregarded for the purposes of any financial ratio determination under the 
Loan Documents other than for determining compliance with Section 7.14;

applied as a mandatory prepayment of the Term Loan in accordance with 
Section 2.03(b)(iv) hereof; and (vii) no Lender shall be required to make

ARTICLE IX
 
Administrative Agent and Other Agents
 
Section 9.01.  Appointment and Authority of the Administrative Agent.  Each 
Lender hereby irrevocably appoints Mclarty to act on its behalf as the 
Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and 
authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and 
to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the 
terms hereof or thereof, together with such actions and powers as are 
reasonably incidental thereto.  The provisions of this Article IX (other 
than Sections 9.09 and 9.11) are solely for the benefit of the 
Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and the Borrowers shall not have 
rights as a third party beneficiary of any such provision.  This Agreement 
does not give rise now or in the future to an agency or partnership 
relationship between any Borrower and any Agent or any of their respective 
Affiliates.
 
Section 9.02.  Rights as a Lender.  Any Person serving as an Agent 
(including as Administrative Agent) hereunder shall have the same rights 
and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise 
the same as though it were not an Agent and the term Lender or Lenders 
shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise 
requires, include each Person serving as an Agent hereunder in its 
individual capacity.  Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits 
from, lend money to, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory 
capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with any Borrower 
or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not an 
Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders.  
The Lenders acknowledge that, pursuant to such activities, any Agent or its 
Affiliates may receive information regarding any Loan Party or any of its 
Affiliates (including information that may be subject to confidentiality 
obligations in favor of any Loan Party or such Affiliate) and acknowledge 
that no Agent shall be under any obligation to provide such information to 
them.
 
Section 9.03.  Exculpatory Provisions.  Neither the Administrative Agent 
nor any other Agent shall have any duties or obligations except those 
expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents.  Without 
limiting the generality of the foregoing, an Agent (including the 
Administrative Agent):
 
(a)           shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied 
duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing and 
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the use of the term 
agent herein and in the other Loan Documents with reference to any Agent 
is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) 
obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable Law and 
instead, such term is used merely as a matter of market custom, and is 
intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between 
independent contracting parties;
 
(b)           shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or 
exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers 
expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that such 
Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required 
Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be 
expressly provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents), provided 
that no Agent shall be required to
 
82
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may 
expose such Agent to liability or that is contrary to the Loan Documents or 
applicable law; and
 
(c)           shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the 
other Loan Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable 
for the failure to disclose, any information relating to any Borrower or 
any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by any Person 
serving as an Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.
 
The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not 
taken by it (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders 
(or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, 
or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith shall be 
necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Sections 10.01 and 8.02) 
or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct as 
determined by the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, in 
connection with its duties expressly set forth herein.  The Administrative 
Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until 
notice describing such Default is given to the Administrative Agent by a 
Borrower or a Lender.
 
No Agent-Related Person shall be responsible for or have any duty to 
ascertain or inquire into (i) any recital, statement, warranty or 
representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other 
Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other 
document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or 
therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, 
agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the 
occurrence of any Default (including, without limitation, compliance with 
the terms and conditions of Section 10.07(h)(iii)), (iv) the validity, 
enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other 
Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the 
satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein, 
other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered 
to the Administrative Agent, or to inspect the properties, books or records 
of any Loan Party or any Affiliate thereof.
 
Section 9.04.  Reliance by the Administrative Agent.
 
The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not 
incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, 
consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any 
electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other 
distribution) believed by it in the absence of bad faith to be genuine and 
to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person.  
The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally 
or by telephone and believed by it in the absence of bad faith to have been 
made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying 
thereon.  In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the 
making of the Term Loan that by its terms must be fulfilled to the 
satisfaction of a Lender, the Administrative Agent may presume that such 
condition is satisfactory to such Lender unless the Administrative Agent 
shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender prior to the 
making of the Term Loan.  The Administrative Agent may consult with legal 
counsel (including counsel acting for the Borrowers), independent 
accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for 
any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any 
such counsel, accountants or experts.
 
83
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to 
take any action under the Loan Documents unless it shall first receive such 
advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders as it deems appropriate and, 
if it so requests, it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the 
Lenders against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by 
it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action.  The 
Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in 
refraining from acting, under this Agreement or any other Loan Document in 
accordance with a request or consent of the Required Lenders (or such 
greater number of Lenders as may be expressly required hereby in any 
instance) and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant 
thereto shall be binding upon all the Lenders; provided that the 
Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its 
opinion or in the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Administrative 
Agent to liability or that is contrary to the Loan Documents or applicable 
Law.
 
Section 9.05.  Delegation of Duties.  The Administrative Agent may perform 
any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or 
under any other Loan Documents by or through any one or more sub agents 
appointed by the Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent and any 
such sub agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its 
rights and powers by or through their respective Agent-Related Persons.  
The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any such sub 
agent and to the Agent-Related Persons of the Administrative Agent and any 
such sub agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in 
connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for 
herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.
 
Section 9.06.  Non-Reliance of Administrative Agent and Other Lenders; 
Disclosure of Information by Agents.  Each Lender acknowledges that no 
Agent-Related Person has made any representation or warranty to it, and 
that no act by any Agent hereafter taken, including any consent to and 
acceptance of any assignment or review of the affairs of any Loan Party or 
any Affiliate thereof, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or 
warranty by any Agent-Related Person to any Lender as to any matter, 
including whether Agent-Related Persons have disclosed material information 
in their possession.  Each Lender represents to each Agent that it has, 
independently and without reliance upon any Agent-Related Person and based 
on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its 
own appraisal of, and investigation into the business, prospects, 
operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of 
the Loan Parties and their respective Subsidiaries, and all applicable bank 
or other regulatory Laws relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, 
and made its own decision to enter into this Agreement and to extend credit 
to the Borrowers and the other Loan Parties hereunder.  Each Lender also 
represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon any 
Agent-Related Person and based on such documents and information as it 
shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit 
analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under 
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to make such 
investigations as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, 
prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and 
creditworthiness of the Borrowers and the other Loan Parties.  Except for 
notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to 
the Lenders by any Agent herein, such Agent shall not have any duty or 
responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information 
concerning the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and 
other condition or creditworthiness of any
 
84
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
of the Loan Parties or any of their respective Affiliates which may come 
into the possession of any Agent-Related Person.
 
Section 9.07.  Indemnification of Agents.  Whether or not the transactions 
contemplated hereby are consummated, the Lenders shall indemnify upon 
demand the Administrative Agent and each other Agent-Related Person (solely 
to the extent any such Agent-Related Person was performing services on 
behalf of the Administrative Agent) (to the extent not reimbursed by or on 
behalf of any Loan Party and without limiting the obligation of any Loan 
Party to do so), pro rata, and hold harmless the Administrative Agent and 
each other Agent-Related Person (solely to the extent any such 
Agent-Related Person was performing services on behalf of the 
Administrative Agent) from and against any and all Indemnified Liabilities 
incurred by it; provided that no Lender shall be liable for the payment to 
any Agent-Related Person of any portion of such Indemnified Liabilities 
resulting from such Agent-Related Persons own gross negligence or willful 
misconduct, as determined by the final judgment of a court of competent 
jurisdiction; provided that no action taken in accordance with the 
directions of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of 
the Lenders as shall be required by the Loan Documents) shall be deemed to 
constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct for purposes of this 
Section 9.07.  In the case of any investigation, litigation or proceeding 
giving rise to any Indemnified Liabilities, this Section 9.07 applies 
whether any such investigation, litigation or proceeding is brought by any 
Lender or any other Person.  Without limitation of the foregoing, each 
Lender shall reimburse the Administrative Agent upon demand for its ratable 
share of any costs or out-of-pocket expenses (including Attorney Costs) 
incurred by the Administrative Agent in connection with the preparation, 
execution, delivery, administration, modification, amendment or enforcement 
(whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal 
advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement, any 
other Loan Document, or any document contemplated by or referred to herein, 
to the extent that the Administrative Agent is not reimbursed for such 
expenses by or on behalf of the Borrowers, provided that such reimbursement 
by the Lenders shall not affect the Borrowers continuing reimbursement 
obligations with respect thereto, provided, further, that the failure of 
any Lender to indemnify or reimburse the Administrative Agent shall not 
relieve any other Lender of its obligation in respect thereof.  The 
undertaking in this Section 9.07 shall survive termination of the Aggregate 
Commitments, the payment of all other Obligations and the resignation of 
the Administrative Agent.
 
Section 9.08.  No Other Duties; Other Agents; Manners, etc.  Anything 
herein to the contrary notwithstanding, no Agent shall have any powers, 
duties or responsibilities under this Agreement or any of the other Loan 
Documents, except in its capacity as the Administrative Agent or a Lender 
hereunder and such Persons shall have the benefit of this Article IX.  
Without limiting the foregoing, none of the Lenders or other Persons so 
identified shall have or be deemed to have any agency or fiduciary or trust 
relationship with any Lender, the Parent, any Borrower or any of their 
respective Subsidiaries.  Each Lender acknowledges that it has not relied, 
and will not rely, on any of the Lenders or other Persons so identified in 
deciding to enter into this Agreement or in taking or not taking action 
hereunder.
 
Section 9.09.  Resignation of Administrative Agent.  The Administrative 
Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders and the 
Borrowers.  Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required 
Lenders shall have the right, with the consent of the
 
85
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Borrowers at all times other than during the existence of an Event of 
Default (which consent of the Borrowers shall not be unreasonably withheld 
or delayed), to appoint a successor, which shall be a Lender or a bank with 
an office in the United States, or an Affiliate of any such Lender or bank 
with an office in the United States.  If no such successor shall have been 
so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such 
appointment within thirty (30) days after the retiring Administrative Agent 
gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may 
on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent meeting 
the qualifications set forth above; provided that if the Administrative 
Agent shall notify the Borrowers and the Lenders that no qualifying Person 
has accepted such appointment, then such resignation shall nonetheless 
become effective in accordance with such notice and (a) the retiring 
Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations 
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, and (b) all payments, 
communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the 
Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender directly, 
until such time as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Administrative 
Agent as provided for above in this Section.  Upon the acceptance of a 
successors appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder such successor 
shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, 
privileges and duties of the retiring (or retired) Administrative Agent and 
the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all of its 
duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents (if not 
already discharged therefrom as provided above in this Section).  After the 
retiring Agents resignation hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, 
the provisions of this Article and Sections 10.04 and 10.05 shall continue 
in effect for the benefit of such retiring Agent, its sub-agents and their 
respective Agent-Related Persons in respect of any actions taken or omitted 
to be taken by any of them while the retiring Agent was acting as 
Administrative Agent.
 
Section 9.10.  Administrative Agent May File Proofs of Claim.  In case of 
the pendency of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or any other 
judicial proceeding relative to any Loan Party, the Administrative Agent 
(irrespective of whether the principal of the Term Loan shall then be due 
and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and 
irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand 
on the Borrowers) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such 
proceeding or otherwise:
 
(a)           to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the 
principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Term Loan, and 
all other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other 
documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of 
the Lenders and the Administrative Agent (including any claim for the 
reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the 
Lenders and the Administrative Agent and their respective agents and 
counsel and all other amounts due the Lenders and the Administrative Agent 
under Sections 2.07 and 10.04) allowed in such judicial proceeding; and
 
(b)           to collect and receive any monies or other property payable 
or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;
 
and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or 
other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized 
by each Lender to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in 
the event that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such 
payments directly to the Lenders, to pay to the Administrative Agent any 
amount due for
 
86
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the 
Agents and their respective agents and counsel, and any other amounts due 
the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.07 and 10.04.
 
Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative 
Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender 
any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition 
affecting the Obligations or the rights of any Lender or to authorize the 
Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender in any 
such proceeding.
 
Section 9.11.  Guaranty Matters.  Each of the Lenders irrevocably 
authorizes the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent agrees 
that it will release any Guarantor from its obligations under the Guarantee 
Agreement if such Person ceases to be a Subsidiary as a result of a 
transaction or designation permitted hereunder.
 
Upon request by the Administrative Agent at any time, the Required Lenders 
will confirm in writing the Administrative Agents authority to release any 
Guarantor from its obligations under the Guarantee Agreement pursuant to 
this Section 9.11.  In each case as specified in this Section 9.11, the 
Administrative Agent will (and each Lender irrevocably authorizes the 
Administrative Agent to), at the Borrowers expense, execute and deliver to 
the applicable Loan Party such documents as any Loan Party may reasonably 
request to evidence the release of such Guarantor from its obligations 
under the Guarantee Agreement, in each case in accordance with the terms of 
the Loan Documents and this Section 9.11.
 
Section 9.12.  Appointment of Supplemental Administrative Agents.
 
(a)           It is the purpose of this Agreement and the other Loan 
Documents that there shall be no violation of any Law of any jurisdiction 
denying or restricting the right of banking corporations or associations to 
transact business as agent or trustee in such jurisdiction.  It is 
recognized that in case of litigation under this Agreement or any of the 
other Loan Documents, and in particular in case of the enforcement of any 
of the Loan Documents, or in case the Administrative Agent deems that by 
reason of any present or future Law of any jurisdiction it may not exercise 
any of the rights, powers or remedies granted herein or in any of the other 
Loan Documents or take any other action which may be desirable or necessary 
in connection therewith, the Administrative Agent is hereby authorized to 
appoint an additional individual or institution selected by the 
Administrative Agent in its sole discretion as a separate trustee, co- 
trustee, administrative agent, collateral agent, administrative sub-agent 
or administrative co- agent (any such additional individual or institution 
being referred to herein individually as a Supplemental Administrative 
Agent and collectively as Supplemental Administrative Agents).
 
(b)           [Reserved].
 
(c)           Should any instrument in writing from any Loan Party be 
required by any Supplemental Administrative Agent so appointed by the 
Administrative Agent for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming 
to him or it such rights, powers, privileges and duties, the Borrowers 
shall, or shall cause any Loan Party to, execute, acknowledge and deliver 
any and all
 
87
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
such instruments promptly upon request by the Administrative Agent.  In 
case any Supplemental Administrative Agent, or a successor thereto, shall 
die, become incapable of acting, resign or be removed, all the rights, 
powers, privileges and duties of such Supplemental Administrative Agent, to 
the extent permitted by Law, shall vest in and be exercised by the 
Administrative Agent until the appointment of a new Supplemental 
Administrative Agent.
 
Section 9.13.  Senior Subordination Agreement.
 
(a)           In accordance with the terms of the Senior Subordination 
Agreement, this Agreement is subject to the terms and provisions of the 
Subordination Agreement executed by MCLARTY CAPITAL PARTNERS SBIC, L.P., as 
Subordinated Agent, and CITIZENS BANK, N.A., as Senior Agent, dated as of 
the Closing Date (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified 
from time to time) and each Lender, by its acceptance hereof, shall be 
bound by the provisions of such Subordination Agreement.
 
(b)           The Lenders and any other holder of any Obligations 
acknowledge that any Senior Indebtedness incurred will be secured by Liens 
on the Collateral and that the exercise of certain of the rights and 
remedies of the Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents is subject to 
the provisions of the Senior Subordination Agreement or may be subject to 
any other subordination or intercreditor agreement pertaining to any senior 
debt.  Each Lender irrevocably (i) consents to the terms and conditions of 
the Senior Subordination Agreement and any other subordination or 
intercreditor agreement pertaining to any senior debt, (ii) authorizes and 
directs the Administrative Agent to execute and deliver the Senior 
Subordination Agreement, any documents relating thereto and any other 
subordination or intercreditor agreement pertaining to any other 
subordinated debt, in each case, on behalf of such Lender and to take all 
actions (and execute all documents) required (or deemed advisable) by it in 
accordance with the terms of the Senior Subordination Agreement and any 
other subordination or intercreditor agreement pertaining to any other 
senior debt, in each case, and without any further consent, authorization 
or other action by such Lender, (iii) agrees that, upon the execution and 
delivery thereof, such Lender will be bound by the provisions of the Senior 
Subordination Agreement and any other subordination or intercreditor 
agreement pertaining to any other senior debt as if it were a signatory 
thereto and will take no actions contrary to the provisions of such Senior 
Subordination Agreement and any other subordination or intercreditor 
agreement pertaining to any other senior debt, and (iv) agrees that no 
Lender shall have any right of action whatsoever against the Administrative 
Agent as a result of any action taken by the Administrative Agent pursuant 
to this Section or in accordance with the terms of the applicable Senior 
Subordination Agreement and any other subordination or intercreditor 
agreement pertaining to any other senior debt.  Each Lender hereby further 
irrevocably authorizes and directs the Administrative Agent to enter into 
such amendments, supplements or other modifications to the Senior 
Subordination Agreement and any other subordination or intercreditor 
agreement pertaining to any other senior debt as are approved by the 
Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders; provided, that, the 
Administrative Agent may execute and deliver such amendments, supplements 
and modifications thereto as are contemplated by the Senior Subordination 
Agreement and any other subordination or intercreditor agreement pertaining 
to any other senior debt in connection with any extension, renewal, 
refinancing or replacement of this Agreement or any refinancing of the 
Obligations, in each case, on behalf of such Lender and without any further 
consent, authorization or other action by any Lender.  The Administrative 
Agent shall have the benefit of
 
88
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
each of the provisions of Article IX with respect to all actions taken by 
it pursuant to this Section 9.13 or in accordance with the terms of the 
Senior Subordination Agreement and any other subordination or intercreditor 
agreement pertaining to any other subordinated debt to the full extent 
thereof.
 
ARTICLE X
 
Miscellaneous
 
Section 10.01.  Amendments, etc.  Except as otherwise set forth in this 
Agreement (and subject to the terms of the Senior Subordination Agreement), 
no amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan 
Document, and no consent to any departure by the Parent or any other Loan 
Party therefrom, shall be effective unless in writing signed by the 
Required Lenders and the Parent or the applicable Loan Party, as the case 
may be, and each such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the 
specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given; provided

written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby;
 
(b)           postpone any date scheduled for, or reduce the amount of, any 
payment of principal or interest under Section 2.05 or 2.06 without the 
written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby, it being 
understood that the waiver of (or amendment to the terms of) any mandatory 
prepayment of the Term Loan shall not constitute a postponement of any date 
scheduled for the payment of principal or interest;
 
(c)           reduce the principal of, or the rate of interest specified 
herein on, the Term Loan, or (subject to clause (i) of the second proviso

any other Loan Document without the written consent of each Lender directly 
affected thereby; provided that only the consent of the Required Lenders 
shall be necessary to amend the definition of Default Rate or to waive 
any obligation of the Borrowers to pay interest at the Default Rate;
 
(d)           change any provision of this Section 10.01 or the definition

to take any action under the Loan Documents, without the written consent of 
each Lender directly affected thereby; or

with this Agreement may be in a form reasonably determined by the 
Administrative Agent and may be, together with this Agreement, amended and 
Lenders rights thereunder waived with the consent of the Administrative 
Agent at the request of the Borrowers without the need to obtain the 
consent of any other Lender if such amendment or waiver is delivered in 
order (i) to comply with local Law or advice of local counsel, (ii) to cure 
ambiguities or defects or (iii) to cause such guarantee or other document 
to be consistent with this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

90
------------------------------------------------------------------------

AVAILABLE.  THE AGENT PARTIES (AS DEFINED BELOW) DO NOT WARRANT THE 
ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF THE BORROWER MATERIALS OR THE ADEQUACY OF THE 
PLATFORM, AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM LIABILITY FOR ERRORS IN OR OMISSIONS FROM 
THE BORROWER MATERIALS.  NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR 
STATUTORY, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A 
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON- INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS OR FREEDOM FROM 
VIRUSES OR OTHER CODE DEFECTS, IS MADE BY ANY AGENT PARTY IN CONNECTION 
WITH THE BORROWER MATERIALS OR THE PLATFORM.  In no event shall the 
Administrative Agent or any of its Agent-Related Persons (collectively, the 
Agent Parties) have any liability to the Parent, any Borrower, any 
Lender, or any other Person for losses, claims, damages, liabilities or 
expenses of any kind (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) arising out 
of the Borrowers or the Administrative Agents transmission of Borrower 
Materials through the Internet, except to the extent that such losses, 
claims, damages, liabilities or expenses are determined by a court of 
competent jurisdiction by a final and nonappealable judgment to have 
resulted from the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of such 
Agent Party; provided, however, that in no event shall any Agent Party have 
any liability to the Parent, any Borrower, any Lender or any other Person 
for indirect, special, incidental, consequential or punitive damages (as 
opposed to direct or actual damages).
 
(e)           Change of Address.  Each of the Parent, the Borrowers and the 
Administrative Agent may change its address, telecopier or telephone number

which notices and other communications may be sent and (ii) accurate wire 
instructions for such Lender.  Furthermore, each Public Lender agrees to 
cause at least one individual at or on behalf of such Public Lender to at 
all times have selected the Private Side Information or similar

(f)            Reliance by the Administrative Agent.  The Administrative 
Agent and the Lenders shall be entitled to rely and act upon any notices 
purportedly given by or on behalf of the Parent or any Borrower even if (i) 
such notices were not made in a manner specified herein, were incomplete or 
were not preceded or followed by any other form of notice specified herein, 
or (ii) the terms thereof, as understood by the recipient, varied from any 
confirmation thereof.  The Borrowers shall indemnify the Administrative 
Agent each Lender and the Agent-Related Persons of each of them from all 
losses, costs, expenses and liabilities resulting from the reliance in the 
absence of bad faith by such Person on each notice purportedly given by or 
on behalf of the Parent or any Borrower.  All telephonic notices to and 
other telephonic communications with the Administrative Agent may be 
recorded by the Administrative Agent, and each of the parties hereto hereby 
consents to such recording.
 
Section 10.03.  No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies.  No failure by any Lender 
or the Administrative Agent to exercise, and no delay by any such Person in 
exercising, any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder or under any 
other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single 
or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder 
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other 
right, remedy, power or privilege.  The rights, remedies, powers and 
privileges herein provided, and provided under each other Loan Document, 
are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, remedies, powers and 
privileges provided by Law.

consent or other modification of the provisions hereof and thereof (whether 
or not the transactions contemplated thereby are consummated), and the 
consummation and administration of the transactions contemplated hereby and 
thereby, (b) to pay or reimburse the Administrative Agent for all 
reasonable and documented appraisal fees, filing and search charges, 
recording taxes and Field Examination charges and expenses and (b) to pay 
or reimburse the Administrative Agent and the Lenders for all reasonable 
and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with

expenses incurred during any legal proceeding, including any proceeding 
under any Debtor Relief Law, and including all Attorney Costs of counsel to 
the Administrative Agent and the Lenders taken as a whole (and, if 
reasonably necessary, one local counsel in any relevant material 
jurisdiction).  The agreements in this Section 10.04 shall survive the 
termination of the Aggregate Commitments and repayment of all other 
Obligations.  All amounts due under this Section 10.04 shall be paid 
promptly following receipt by the Parent of an invoice relating thereto 
setting forth such expenses in reasonable detail.  If any Loan Party fails 
to pay when due any costs, expenses or other amounts payable by
 
92

it hereunder or under the Loan Documents, such amount may be paid on behalf 
of any Loan Party by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion.
 
Section 10.05.  Indemnification by the Borrowers.  The Borrowers shall 
indemnify and hold harmless the Agents, each Lender, and their respective 
Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, partners, trustees or 
advisors and other representatives (collectively the Indemnitees) from 
and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, and expenses 
(including Attorney Costs) of any kind or nature whatsoever which may at 
any time be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against any such Indemnitee 
in any way relating to or arising out of or in connection with (but 
limited, in the case of Attorney Costs, to the reasonable and documented 
out-of-pocket fees, disbursements and other charges of one counsel to all 
Indemnitees taken as a whole and, if reasonably necessary, a single local 
counsel for all Indemnitees taken as a whole in each relevant jurisdiction 
that is material to the interest of the Lenders) (a) the execution, 
delivery, enforcement, performance or administration of the Loan Documents 
or any other agreement, letter or instrument delivered in connection with 
the transactions contemplated thereby or the consummation of the 
transactions contemplated thereby, (b) any Commitment, Loan or the use or 
proposed use of the proceeds therefrom, (c) any actual or alleged presence 
or release of Hazardous Materials on or from any property currently or 
formerly owned or operated by any Borrower, any Subsidiary or any other 
Loan Party, or any Environmental Liability related in any way to any 
Borrower, any Subsidiary or any other Loan Party or (d) any actual or 
prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any 
of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory 
(including any investigation of, preparation for, or defense of any pending 
or threatened claim, investigation, litigation or proceeding) and 
regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto (all the foregoing, 
collectively, the Indemnified Liabilities); provided that such indemnity 
shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such 
liabilities, losses, damages, claims, and expenses resulted from (y) the 
gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee or (z) a material 
breach in bad faith of any material obligations under the Loan Documents by 
such Indemnitee, in each case as determined by a final, non-appealable 
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.  To the extent that the 
undertakings to indemnify and hold harmless set forth in this Section 10.05 
may be unenforceable in whole or in part because they are violative of any 
applicable law or public policy, each of the Borrowers shall contribute the 
maximum portion that it is permitted to pay and satisfy under applicable 
law to the payment and satisfaction of all Indemnified Liabilities incurred 
by the Indemnitees or any of them.  No Indemnitee shall be liable for any 
damages arising from the use by others of any information or other 
materials obtained through IntraLinks or other similar information 
transmission systems in connection with this Agreement, nor shall any 
Indemnitee or any Loan Party have any liability for any special, punitive, 
indirect or consequential damages relating to this Agreement or any other 
Loan Document or arising out of its activities in connection herewith or 
therewith (whether before or after the Closing Date).  In the case of an 
investigation, litigation or other proceeding to which the indemnity in 
this Section 10.05 applies, such indemnity shall be effective whether or 
not such investigation, litigation or proceeding is brought by any Loan 
Party, its directors, stockholders or creditors or an Indemnitee or any 
other Person, whether or not any Indemnitee is otherwise a party thereto 
and whether or not any of the transactions contemplated hereunder or under 
any of the other Loan Documents is consummated.  All amounts due under this 
Section 10.05 shall be paid within twenty (20) Business Days after written 
demand therefor.  The agreements in this Section 10.05 shall survive the 
resignation of the Administrative Agent, the replacement of any Lender, the 
termination of
 
93
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
the Aggregate Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of 
all the other Obligations.  This Section 10.05 shall not apply with respect 
to Taxes other than any Taxes that represent losses, claims, damages, etc. 
arising from any non-Tax claim.
 
Section 10.06.  Marshaling; Payments Set Aside.  None of the Administrative 
Agent or any Lender shall be under any obligation to marshal any assets in 
favor of the Loan Parties or any other party or against or in payment of 
any or all of the Obligations.  To the extent that any payment by or on 
behalf of the Borrowers is made to any Agent or any Lender, or any Agent or 
any Lender exercises its right of setoff, and such payment or the proceeds 
of such setoff or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to 
be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to 
any settlement entered into by such Agent or such Lender in its discretion) 
to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in connection with 
any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or otherwise, then (a) to the 
extent of such recovery, the obligation or part thereof originally intended 
to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as 
if such payment had not been made or such setoff had not occurred, and (b) 
each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent upon demand 
its applicable share of any amount so recovered from or repaid by any 
Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such 
payment is made at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate 
from time to time in effect.
 
Section 10.07.  Successors and Assigns.
 
(a)           The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and 
inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors 
and assigns permitted hereby, except that the Parent and the Borrowers may 
not, except as permitted by Section 7.04 and subject to the terms of the 
Senior Subordination Agreement, assign or otherwise transfer any of their 
respective rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written 
consent of the Administrative Agent and each Lender and no Lender may 
assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder 
except (i) to an assignee in accordance with the provisions of subsection 
(b) of this Section, (ii) by way of participation in accordance with the 
provisions of subsection (d) of this Section, or (iii) by way of pledge or 
assignment of a security interest subject to the restrictions of subsection 
(f) of this Section (and any other attempted assignment or transfer by any 
party hereto shall be null and void).  Nothing in this Agreement, expressed 
or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the 
parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, 
Participants to the extent provided in subsection (d) of this Section and, 
to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Agent-Related Persons of 
each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders) any legal or equitable 
right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.
 
(b)           Assignments by Lenders.  Any Lender may at any time assign to 
one or more assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under 
this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Term 
Loan at the time owing to it); provided that any such assignment shall be 
subject to the following conditions:
 
94
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
    (i)            Minimum Amounts.
     
        (A)          in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining
        amount of the assigning Lenders Commitment and the Term Loan at
        the time owing to it or in the case of an assignment to a Lender,
        an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund or during the
        occurrence and continuation of an Event of Default under Section
        8.01(a) or Section 8.01(f), no minimum amount need be assigned; and
         
        (B)          in any case not described in subsection (b)(i)(A) of
        this Section, the aggregate amount of the Commitment or, the
        principal outstanding balance of the Term Loan of the assigning
        Lender subject to each such assignment, determined as of the date
        the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is
        delivered to the Administrative Agent or, if Trade Date is
        specified in the Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade Date,
        shall not be less than $1,000,000 unless each of the Administrative
        Agent and, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is
        continuing, the Parent otherwise consents (each such consent not to
        be unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided, however, that
        concurrent assignments to members of an Assignee Group and
        concurrent assignments from members of an Assignee Group to a
        single Eligible Assignee (or to an Eligible Assignee and members of
        its Assignee Group) will be treated as a single assignment for
        purposes of determining whether such minimum amount has been met.
         
    (ii)           Proportionate Amounts.  Each partial assignment shall be
    made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning
    Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to
    the Term Loan or the Commitment hereunder assigned.
     
    (iii)          Required Consents.  No consent shall be required for any
    assignment except to the extent required by subsection (b)(i)(B) of
    this Section and subject to the terms of the Senior Subordination
    Agreement, and, in addition:
     
        (A)          the consent of the Parent (such consent not to be
        unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required unless (1) an
        Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at the time of such
        assignment or (2) such assignment is to a Lender, an Affiliate of a
        Lender or an Approved Fund; and
         
        (B)          the consent of the Administrative Agent (such consent
        not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required
        unless such assignment is to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or
        an Approved Fund.
         
    (iv)          Assignment and Assumption.  The parties to each
    assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an
    Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation
    fee of $3,500 (unless such assignment is to a Lender, an Affiliate of a
    Lender or an Approved Fund) and the forms required by Section 3.01(b)
    and (c) or Section 3.01(d) as applicable; provided that the
    Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion, elect to waive such
    processing and recordation fee in the case of any
 
95
------------------------------------------------------------------------

     
    assignment.  The Eligible Assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall
    deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire. 
    All assignments shall be by novation.
 
    (v)           No Assignments to Certain Persons.  No such assignment
    shall be made (A) to the Parent, any Borrower or any of their
    respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates or to the Permitted Holders or
    their Affiliates or (B) to a natural person.
     
Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent 
pursuant to clause (c) of this Section, from and after the effective date 
specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the assignee thereunder shall 
be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by 
such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender 
under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the 
extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be 
released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an 
Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lenders rights and 
obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party 
hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01 
(subject to the requirements thereof), 3.04, 3.05, 10.04 and 10.05 with 
respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of 
such assignment).  Upon request, and the surrender by the assigning Lender 
of its Note, the Borrowers (at their expense) shall execute and deliver a 
Note to the assignee Lender.  Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of 
rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this 
subsection shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by 
such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance 
with subsection (d) of this Section.
 
(c)           The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as a 
non-fiduciary agent of the Borrowers, shall maintain at the Administrative 
Agents Office a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and 
a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, 
and the Commitments of, and principal amounts of and related interest 
amounts on the Term Loan, owing to each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof 
from time to time (the Register).  The entries in the Register shall, 
subject to clause (h) of this Section, be conclusive absent manifest error, 
and the Borrowers, the Agents and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose 
name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender 
hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the 
contrary.  The Register shall be available for inspection by any Borrower, 
any Agent and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon 
reasonable prior notice.  This Section 10.07(c) and Section 2.09 shall be 
construed so that all Term Loan are at all times maintained in registered 
form within the meaning of Sections 163(f), 871(h)(2) and 881(c)(2) of the 
Code and any related Treasury regulations (or any other relevant or 
successor provisions of the Code or of such Treasury regulations).
 
(d)           Subject to the terms of the Senior Subordination Agreement, 
any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, the 
Parent, any Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to 
any Person (other than a natural person, a Borrower, the Permitted Holders, 
or any of their respective Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a 
Participant) in all or a portion of such Lenders rights and/or 
obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its 
Commitment and/or the Term Loan owing to it); provided that (i) such 
Lenders
 
96
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender 
shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the 
performance of such obligations, and (iii) the Borrowers, the Agents and 
the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such 
Lender in connection with such Lenders rights and obligations under this 
Agreement.  Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells 
such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole 
right to enforce this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and to approve 
any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or 
any other Loan Document; provided that such agreement or instrument may 
provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, 
agree to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in the first 
proviso to Section 10.01 (other than clause (d) thereof) that directly 
affects such Participant.  Subject to subsection (e) of this Section, the 
Borrowers agree that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of 
Sections 3.01 (subject to the requirements of Section 3.01(b) and (c) or 
Section 3.01(d), as applicable), 3.04 and 3.05 (through the applicable 
Lender) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its 
interest by assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section.  To the 
extent permitted by applicable Law, each Participant also shall be entitled 
to the benefits of Section 10.09 as though it were a Lender; provided that 
such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.11 as though it were a 
Lender.
 
(e)           Limitations upon Participant Rights.  A Participant shall not 
be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 3.01, 3.04 or 3.05 
than the participating Lender would have been entitled to receive with 
respect to the participation sold to such Participant, except to the extent 
such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Change of Law 
that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation.  
Each Lender that sells a participation shall (acting solely for this 
purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrowers) maintain a register 
complying with the requirements of Sections 163(f), 871(h) and 881(c)(2) of 
the Code and the Treasury regulations issued thereunder relating to the 
exemption from withholding for portfolio interest on which is entered the 
name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts of and 
stated interest on each Participants interest in the Term Loan or other 
obligations under this Agreement (the Participant Register).  A Lender 
shall not be obligated to disclose all or any portion of the Participant 
Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information 
relating to a Participants interest in any commitments, loans, letters of 
credit or its other obligations under the Loan Documents) to any Person 
except to the extent such disclosure is necessary to establish that the 
Term Loan or other obligation is in registered form under Section 
5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury regulations.  The entries in the 
Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such 
Lender shall treat each person whose name is recorded in the Participant 
Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this 
Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.  For the avoidance of 
doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) 
shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.
 
(f)            Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security 
interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement 
(including under its Note, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, 
including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal 
Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such 
Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee 
or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.
 
97
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Section 10.08.  Confidentiality.  Each of the Administrative Agent and the 
Lenders agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information in 
accordance with its customary procedures (as set forth below), except that 
Information may be disclosed (a) to its Affiliates and to its and its 
Affiliates respective partners, directors, officers, employees, agents, 
trustees, advisors and representatives on a need-to-know basis (it being 
understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be 
informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to 
keep such Information confidential in accordance with this Section 10.08), 
(b) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority purporting to have 
jurisdiction over it (including any self-regulatory authority, such as the 
National Association of Insurance Commissioners), (c) to the extent 
required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar 
legal process, provided that the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as 
applicable, agrees that it will notify the Parent as soon as practicable in 
the event of any such disclosure by such Person (other than at the request 
of a regulatory authority) unless such notification is prohibited by law, 
rule or regulation, (d) to any other party hereto, (e) in connection with 
the exercise of any remedies hereunder or under any other Loan Document or 
any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan 
Document or the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder, (f) subject 
to an agreement containing provisions at least as restrictive as those of 
this Section 10.08, to (i) any permitted assignee of or Participant in, or 
any permitted prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights 
or obligations under this Agreement or any Eligible Assignee invited to be 
an Additional Lender or (ii) any actual or prospective direct or indirect 
counterparty (or its advisors) to any swap or derivative transaction 
relating to the Borrowers and its obligations, (g) with the consent of the 
Parent, (h) to any rating agency when required by it (it being understood 
that, prior to any such disclosure, such rating agency shall undertake to 
preserve the confidentiality of any Information relating to the Loan 
Parties received by it from such Lender in accordance with this Section 
10.08) or (i) to the extent such Information (i) becomes publicly available 
other than as a result of a breach of this Section or (ii) becomes 
available to the Administrative Agent, any Lender, or any of their 
respective Affiliates on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than 
the Parent, any Borrower or any Subsidiary, and which source is not known 
by such Agent or Lender to be subject to a confidentiality restriction in 
respect thereof in favor of the Parent or any Affiliate thereof.
 
For purposes of this Section, Information means all information received 
from any Loan Party or any Subsidiary (or from any representative or agent 
of any Loan Party or Subsidiary) thereof relating to any Loan Party or any 
Subsidiary thereof or their respective businesses, other than any such 
information that is available to the Administrative Agent or any Lender on 
a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by any Loan Party or any 
Subsidiary thereof; it being understood that all information received from 
the Parent, any Borrower or any Subsidiary after the Closing Date shall be 
deemed confidential unless such information is clearly identified at the 
time of delivery as not being confidential.  Any Person required to 
maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section 
shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so in 
accordance with its customary procedures if such Person has exercised the 
same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as 
such Person would accord to its own confidential information.
 
Each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders acknowledges that (a) the 
Information may include material non-public information concerning a 
Borrower or a Subsidiary, as the case may be, (b) it has developed 
compliance procedures regarding the use of material non-public
 
98
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
information and (c) it will handle such material non-public information in 
accordance with applicable Law, including United States Federal and state 
securities Laws.
 
Section 10.09.  Setoff.  If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be 
continuing, each Lender and each of its Affiliates is hereby authorized at 
any time and from time to time, after obtaining the prior written consent 
of the Administrative Agent, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable 
law, to setoff and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or 
demand, provisional or final, in whatever currency, but excluding payroll, 
employee benefits, tax, trust and other fiduciary deposit accounts) at any 
time held and other obligations (in whatever currency) at any time owing by 
such Lender or any such Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of 
any Borrower or any other Loan Party against any and all of the Obligations 
of such Borrower or any Loan Party now or hereafter existing under this 
Agreement or any other Loan Document to such Lender, irrespective of 
whether or not such Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement 
or any other Loan Document to the extent such Obligations of such Borrower 
or any Loan Party are then due and payable.  The rights of each Lender and 
its Affiliates under this Section are in addition to other rights and 
remedies (including other rights of setoff) that such Lender or its 
Affiliates may have.  Each Lender agrees to notify the Parent and the 
Administrative Agent promptly after any such setoff and application, 
provided that the failure to give such notice to the Parent shall not 
affect the validity of such setoff and application.
 
Section 10.10.  Interest Rate Limitation.  Notwithstanding anything to the 
contrary contained in the Loan Documents, the interest paid or agreed to be 
paid under the Loan Documents shall not exceed the maximum rate of 
non-usurious interest permitted by applicable Law (the Maximum Rate).  If 
any Agent or any Lender shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds 
the Maximum Rate, the excess interest shall be applied to the principal of 
the Term Loan or, if it exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to the 
applicable Borrower.  In determining whether the interest contracted for, 
charged, or received by an Agent or a Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, such 
Person may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) characterize any 
payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or premium rather than 
interest, (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and 
(c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the 
total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the 
Obligations hereunder.
 
Section 10.11.  Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness.  This Agreement 
may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto in 
different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but 
all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract.  This 
Agreement and the other Loan Documents constitute the entire contract among 
the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all 
previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the 
subject matter hereof.  This Agreement shall become effective when the 
closing conditions set forth in Section 4.01 shall have been satisfied or 
waived.  Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this 
Agreement by telecopy or other electronic imaging means shall be effective 
as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.
 
Section 10.12.  Electronic Execution of Assignments and Certain Other 
Documents.  The words execution, signed, signature, and words of like 
import in any Assignment and Assumption or in any amendment or other 
modification hereof (including waivers and consents)
 
99
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
shall be deemed to include electronic signatures or the keeping of records 
in electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, 
validity or enforceability as a manually executed signature or the use of a 
paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the extent and as 
provided for in any applicable law, including the Federal Electronic 
Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, the New York State 
Electronic Signatures and Records Act, or any other similar state laws 
based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act.
 
Section 10.13.  Survival of Representations and Warranties.  All 
representations and warranties made hereunder and (i) any other Loan 
Document or other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in 
connection herewith or therewith shall survive the execution and delivery 
hereof and thereof.  Such representations and warranties have been or will 
be relied upon by the Administrative Agent and each Lender, regardless of 
any investigation made by the Administrative Agent or any Lender or on 
their behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent or any 
Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default at the time of the 
making of the Term Loan, and shall continue in full force and effect as 
long as the Term Loan or any other Obligation (other than contingent 
indemnification obligations not yet accrued and payable) hereunder shall 
remain unpaid or unsatisfied.
 
Section 10.14.  Severability.  If any provision of this Agreement or the 
other Loan Documents is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, (a) 
the legality, validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of 
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall not be affected or 
impaired thereby and (b) the parties shall endeavor in good faith 
negotiations to replace the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions 
with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as 
possible to that of the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions.  The 
invalidity of a provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate 
or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.
 
Section 10.15.  GOVERNING LAW.
 
(a)           THIS AGREEMENT AND EACH OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED 
BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.
 
(b)           THE PARENT, EACH BORROWER, THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, EACH 
OTHER AGENT AND EACH LENDER EACH IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY SUBMITS,

HERETO IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY AGREES THAT ALL CLAIMS IN RESPECT OF 
ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING MAY BE HEARD AND DETERMINED IN SUCH NEW YORK 
STATE COURT OR, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN SUCH

ANY SUCH
 
100
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 

 
ACTION OR PROCEEDING SHALL BE CONCLUSIVE AND MAY BE ENFORCED IN OTHER 
JURISDICTIONS BY SUIT ON THE JUDGMENT OR IN ANY OTHER MANNER PROVIDED BY 
LAW.  EACH PARTY HERETO AGREES THAT THE AGENTS AND LENDERS RETAIN THE RIGHT 
TO SERVE PROCESS IN ANY OTHER MANNER PERMITTED BY LAW OR TO BRING 
PROCEEDINGS AGAINST ANY LOAN PARTY IN THE COURTS OF ANY OTHER JURISDICTION 
IN CONNECTION WITH THE ENFORCEMENT OF ANY JUDGMENT.
 
(c)           THE PARENT, EACH BORROWER, THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, EACH 
OTHER AGENT AND EACH LENDER EACH IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO 
THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY OBJECTION THAT IT MAY 
NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OF ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING 
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT IN 
ANY COURT REFERRED TO IN PARAGRAPH (b) OF THIS SECTION.  EACH OF THE 
PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED 
BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE DEFENSE OF AN INCONVENIENT FORUM TO THE MAINTENANCE 
OF SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING IN ANY SUCH COURT.
 
Section 10.16.  WAIVER OF RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.  EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY 
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY 
RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR 
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN

ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY).  EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES 
THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PERSON HAS 
REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PERSON WOULD NOT, IN 
THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) 
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO 
ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS BY, AMONG OTHER 
THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.
 
Section 10.17.  Termination.  This Agreement (other than the provisions 
that expressly state that they shall survive termination of this Agreement) 
shall terminate upon payment in full of the Obligations (other than 
contingent indemnification obligations not yet accrued and payable).
 
Section 10.18.  Lender Action.  Each Lender agrees that it shall not take 
or institute any actions or proceedings, judicial or otherwise, for any 
right or remedy against any Loan Party under any of the Loan Documents 
(including the exercise of any right of setoff, rights on account of any 
bankers lien or similar claim or other rights of self-help), or institute 
any actions or proceedings, or otherwise commence any remedial procedures, 
with respect to any property of any Loan Party, without the prior written 
consent of the Administrative Agent (which shall not be withheld in 
contravention of Section 9.04).  The provision of this Section 10.18 are

Agreement that such Agent proposes to use and that incorporate or use any 
Loan Partys name, product photographs, logo or trademark.  Each any Loan 
Party agrees that its consent to the publication in the ordinary course of 
such material will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and, provided, 
any Loan Party shall be deemed to have consented thereto unless it shall 
object thereto by written notice within five (5) Business Days after having 
received notice thereof.  Such consent shall remain effective until revoked 
by any Loan Party in writing to the Administrative Agent.
 
Section 10.20.  USA PATRIOT Act Notice.  Each Lender that is subject to the 
USA PATRIOT Act and the Administrative Agent (for itself and not on behalf

requirements of the USA PATRIOT Act, it is required to obtain, verify and 
record information that identifies each Loan Party, which information
