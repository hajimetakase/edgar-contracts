liability company, the other Borrowers party thereto, JPMorgan Chase Bank, 
N.A., as Administrative Agent (“Administrative Agent”), the other Agents 
party thereto and the Lenders from time to time a party thereto; 
capitalized terms used but not defined herein are used with the meanings 
assigned to them in the Credit Agreement.
Ladies and Gentlemen:


1.Borrowing Base. This letter agreement constitutes a New Borrowing Base 
Notice delivered pursuant to Section 2.07(e) of the Credit Agreement. 
Pursuant to Section 2.07 of the Credit Agreement, and subject to the 
satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth in Section 3 below, the 
Lenders hereby agree that the Borrowing Base shall be increased from 
$484,500,000 to $650,000,000 effective as of November [5], 2014, and 
continuing until the next Scheduled Redetermination, Interim 
Redetermination, Optional Swap Unwind Redetermination, or other adjustment 
of the Borrowing Base, as applicable, pursuant to the terms of the Credit 
Agreement. The parties hereto agree that the redetermination of the 
Borrowing Base provided for in this Section 1 shall be the November 1, 2014 
Scheduled Redetermination and shall not be deemed or construed to be an 
Interim Redetermination or Optional Swap Unwind Redetermination for 
purposes of Section 2.07 of the Credit Agreement.


2.    Extension of the Specified Period. Reference is made to that certain 
Limited Consent and Fourteenth Amendment to Eighth Restated Credit

Administrative Agent and the Lenders (as amended by the August 2014 Letter 
Agreement (as defined below), the “Limited Consent”) and that certain 
Letter Agreement dated as of August 14, 2014 by and among Parent,

Consent and as extended in the August 2014 Letter Agreement) until the 
effective date of the May 1, 2015 Scheduled Redetermination pursuant to 
Section 2.07 of the Credit Agreement and (b) provide their limited consent 
to the Temporary Hedging Noncompliance (as defined in the Limited Consent) 
for the Specified Period as so extended.


3.    Conditions Precedent to Borrowing Base Increase, Extension of 
Specified Period and Limited Consent. The increase of the Borrowing Base 
provided for in Section 1 hereof and the extension of the Specified Period 
and the limited consent provided for in Section 2 hereof shall be subject 
to the occurrence of each of the following conditions precedent:


(a)    The Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof 
duly executed by Parent, each Borrower and each Lender;


(b)    The Administrative Agent and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC shall have 
received all fees and other amounts due and payable on or prior to the 
effective date of the increase of the Borrowing Base provided for in 
Section 1 and the extension of the Specified Period provided for in 
Section 2, including, without limitation, the upfront fees described in 
clause (c) below; and


(c)    The Administrative Agent shall have received, for the account of 
each Increasing Lender (as defined below), an upfront fee in an amount, for 
each such Increasing Lender, equal to 30 basis points (0.30%) of such 
Increasing Lender’s Increased Commitment (as defined below). As used 
herein, “Increasing Lender” means each Lender whose Commitment, after 
giving effect to Section 1 hereof, exceeds such Lender’s Commitment on 
December 18, 2013 (after giving effect to the increase in the Borrowing 
Base to $600,000,000 on such date) and “Increased Commitment” means the 
amount of such excess.


4.    Representations and Warranties. To induce the Administrative Agent 
and Lenders to enter into this letter agreement, each Credit Party hereby 
represents and warrants to the Lenders and Administrative Agent as follows:


      (a)
Each representation and warranty of such Credit Party contained in the 
Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents is true and correct on the 
date hereof, except to the extent any such representations and warranties 
are expressly limited to an earlier date, in which case such 
representations and warranties shall be true and correct as of such 
specified earlier date.
      (b)
After giving effect to the extension of the Specified Period as 
contemplated hereunder and in the August 2014 Letter Agreement, no Default 
or Event of Default has occurred which is continuing and the total Credit 
Exposures of all Lenders do not exceed the Borrowing Base.
5.    Reaffirmation of Loan Documents. Any and all of the terms and 
provisions of the Credit Agreement, the Limited Consent, the August 2014 
Letter Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall, except as amended and 
modified hereby, remain in full force and effect. Nothing contained herein 
shall limit or impair any Liens securing the Indebtedness, each of which 
are hereby ratified, affirmed and extended to secure the Indebtedness as 
they may be increased pursuant hereto. Each

the legal, valid and binding obligation of such Credit Party, enforceable 
against it in accordance with its terms.


6.    No Other Waiver. Except as explicitly set forth in Section 2, nothing 
contained in this letter agreement shall be construed as a waiver by the 
Administrative Agent or any Lender of any covenant or provision of the 
Credit Agreement, the other Loan Documents or any other contract or 
instrument between any Credit Party and the Administrative Agent or any 
Lender, and the failure of the Administrative Agent or any Lender at any 
time or times hereafter to require strict performance by the Credit Parties

preparation, negotiation and execution of this letter agreement and all 
related documents; (b) this letter agreement may be executed in

Administrative Agent and each of the Lenders, and facsimiles or other 
electronic transmission (e.g., pdf) shall be effective as originals; (c)
