II.
SCOPE OF SERVICES/PROGRAMS/ACTIVITIES:

HIR will develop, implement, and maintain an ongoing stock market support 
system for BMAQ through a coordinated program of  proactive telephone and 
non-deal roadshow campaigns to expand awareness among all appropriate 
members of the investment community, including stockbrokers, analysts, and 
micro-cap portfolio/fund managers. The program will be predicated on 
accurate, deliberate and direct disclosure and information flow from the 
Company and dissemination to the appropriate investor audiences; we will 
expand your shareholder base by marketing to the buyside directly as well 
as by marketing to the sellside and pursuing research coverage as 
appropriate.  Key information to be articulated to the investing public 
includes:

·
      A better understanding of the core growth opportunities and key
      drivers for the end-market being addressed;
·
      The extent of the Company’s growth plans, capital requirements, and
      operating leverage;
·
      Establishing and articulating the key operating, growth, and
      valuation metrics that investors/shareholders should focus on to
      judge future performance. Answering the question, why should an
      investor invest in BMAQ?


1.
      PROFESSIONAL INVESTMENT COMMUNITY AWARENESS

A.
         Conference calls/meetings arranged by HIR with BMAQ in select
         cities (and at compatible times) with executive management at
         BMAQ.  Target cities shall include New York, Boston,
         Baltimore/Washington Metropolitan area, Philadelphia,
         Greenwich/Stamford, Dallas, Houston, St. Louis, Denver, Atlanta,
         Phoenix/Scottsdale, Chicago, Minneapolis, Milwaukee, Southern
         California, San Francisco, and other select cities that express
         interest. Our mutual goal is to optimize when and where possible a
         mix of approximately five to eight meetings in a single day and to
         combine contacts when possible to maximize throughput.  HIR at a
         minimum will commit to executing three (3) days of road shows per
         quarter. In addition to formal road shows we will set up
         teleconference calls for management with interested investors per
         managements availability as we find interest in-between/outside
         of road shows.
B.
         All interested parties will be continually updated of the
         Companys progress via phone conversations and through our
         fax/e-mail list for news releases.
C.
         HIR will screen all investment firms for upcoming financial
         conferences, which would be appropriate for BMAQ. HIR will work
         through the proper channels with the goal of receiving invitations
         for management to present at those conferences which are relevant.

2.
      SHAREHOLDER COMMUNICATIONS  

A.
         On a regular basis HIR will contact known key shareholders,
         research analysts, and other prospective sources of capital
         markets support and gather perception feedback for BMAQ executive
         management on their views and expectations of results, valuation,
         and managements execution relative to expectations.
B.
         HIR will open dialogue, expand and update a database of known and
         potential shareholders and keep key investors informed once
         material developments are reported.
C.
         HIR will during the first 30 days of this agreement undertake an
         analysis of BMAQs financials and all operating metrics in detail
         and keep updated on these metrics allowing interactions with new
         and current investors and articulating the necessary information
         to assist professionals in completing their due diligence.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

D.
         HIR shall handle investor requests for timely information
         fulfillment via the telephone and e-mail. HIR will have a
         knowledgeable senior professional available during market hours to
         field and respond to all investor inquiries and update the
         shareholder database accordingly. This is a time intensive service
         that allows management to focus on executing while showing the
         Company is shareholder friendly and proactive in its communication
         efforts.
E.
         HIR will at the minimum provide same day fulfillment for all
         investor package requests received prior to 4 p.m. EST with next
         day fulfillment received after such time.  Fulfillment will be
         provided electronically where possible and HIR will work with BMAQ
         in developing any and all either printed or electronically
         developed approved investor materials.  
F.
         HIR shall assist BMAQ with quarterly conference calls to accompany
         the release of quarterly and annual financial results. HIR will
         assist with scripting these calls and monitoring the continuity to
         ensure a smooth roll-out for investors.  HIR will further assist
         BMAQ in working with third parties to facilitate any recorded and
         printed transcripts and 8-K filings as part of BMAQ regulatory
         filing requirements.

3.
THE FINANCIAL PRESS

HIR will assist executive management in drafting and supporting BMAQ in 
delivering complete press releases on all material events as deemed by the 
Company to the investing public.  Executive Management and corporate 
counsel, when required by BMAQs press release policy and procedures, will 
approve all press releases before they are sent to the wire. We have 
negotiated volume discounts with a top-tier wire service vendor and shall 
pass through those significantly discounted pricing plans on a wide range 
of services to BMAQ. At Companys discretion, HIR will disseminate news 
releases through a Broadcast Fax and/or electronic mail (e-mail) to our 
established database of financial professionals including: special 
situation analysts, brokers, fund managers, individual investors, money 
managers, and current or prospective individual shareholders who are 
already invested or have expressed an interest in BMAQ.

4.
      PUBLIC MARKET INSIGHT

Paramount to our collective efforts, HIR will discuss with executive 
management the importance of establishing conservative expectations and how 
various corporate actions may be perceived and impact the public market. 
HIR has the capability to help assess acquisition candidates, discuss the 
financial impacts, in addition to the longer term implications. We will 
assist executive management in understanding the life cycle of the 
financial markets and how BMAQ is impacted directly and indirectly by 
different variables. The Team at HIR leverages its collective expertise 
gained through representing over 200 public companies to help our clients 
understand expectations, valuations, perceptions, and investment 
methodologies utilized by investment professionals. We believe this 
consulting aspect of our business is extremely valuable for management to 
optimize key opportunities and to avoid pitfalls.
