  Contract and have the equal legal force as the Contract.
   
  4.              INTEREST RATE ON THE LOAN, DEFAULT INTEREST RATE,
  INTEREST CALCULATION AND SETTLEMENT
   
  4.1       Interest Rate on the Loan (the Loan Rate)
   
        The Loan Rate hereunder shall be an annual rate set forth in item
        (2) below:
         
      (1)         a fixed interest rate of                      % which
      shall remain the same during the Term;
       
      (2)         [See Schedule A] on the date when interest commences to
      accrue (the Interest Commencement Date). Such interest rate shall
      remain the same during the Term; or
       
      (3)         a floating interest rate equal to      (100% a floating
      percentage of      %) (the Floating Percentage) of the Base Rate
      (as defined below) on the date when interest commences to accrue (the
      Interest Commencement Date). The Loan Rate shall, during the period
      between the Interest Commencement Date and the date when all the
      principal amount and interest accrued thereon under the Contract have
      been fully repaid, be adjusted once every        months in accordance
      with the Base Rate on the interest rate adjustment date and the
      Floating Percentage. The interest rate adjustment date shall be a
      date corresponding to the Interest
 

2

 

 
      Commencement Date in the month when such interest is adjusted. If
      there is no such a date corresponding to the Interest Commencement
      Date in such month, the adjustment date for the interest rate shall
      be the last day of such month.
 
    4.2             Default Interest Rate
         
      (1)         If Party A does not use the Loan hereunder for purposes
      set forth herein (Misappropriation), the default interest rate on
      such Loan shall be (100% plus 100%) of the Loan Rate. If the Loan
      Rate is adjusted according to Article 4.1 (3) above, the default
      interest rate shall be adjusted in accordance with the adjusted Loan
      Rate and the upward floating percentage set out in this Article 4.2
      (1).
       
      (2)         The default interest rate on overdue Loan shall be (100%
      plus 50 %) of the Loan Rate. If the Loan Rate is adjusted according
      to Article 4.1 (3) above, such default interest rate shall be
      adjusted in accordance with the adjusted Loan Rate and the upward
      floating percentage set out in this Article 4.2 (2).
       
      (3)         If Misappropriation and overdue payment occur
      concurrently, the default interest shall be calculated and compounded
      in accordance with the higher of the two default interest rates
      provided for in Articles 4.2(1) and 4.2(2) herein.
       
    4.3             The Interest Commencement Date provided in this Article
    4 refers to the date on which the proceeds of the first advance have
    been deposited into the loan disbursement account designated in Article
    6 (the Loan Disbursement Account).
     
     For the first advance of the Loan, the Base Rate refers to the lending
     interest rate quoted by the Peoples Bank of China (the PBOC) on the
     Interest Commencement Date for loans with the same tenor and within
     the same category. If the lending interest rate on other advances of
     the Loan is adjusted in accordance with Article 4.1 (3), the Base R
     ate refers to the lending interest rate quoted by the PBOC on the
     interest rate adjustment date for loans with the same tenor and within
     the same category. If the PBOC no longer publishes such lending
     interest rate, the Base Rate shall mean, unless agreed otherwise
     between the parties, the lending interest rate with the same tenor and
     within the same category generally accepted by the banking industry 
     on the interest rate adjustment date or an interest rate commonly used
     for a loan with the same tenor and within the same category.
      
    4.4             The interest on the Loan shall commence to accrue as of
    the date when such Loan proceeds have been deposited into the Loan
    Disbursement Account designated by Party A. Interest on the Loan shall
    be computed daily with the daily interest rate equal to 1/360 of the
    annual interest rate. If Party A can not pay interest on the interest
    settlement date as provided herein, the interest shall be compounded as
    of the date immediately following the applicable interest settlement
    date.
     
    4.5             Interest Settlement
     
        (1)                     For a loan subject to a fixed interest
        rate, the interest accrued thereon shall be calculated in
        accordance with the agreed fixed interest rate. For a loan subject
        to a floating interest rate, the interest accrued thereon shall be
        calculated in accordance with the interest rate determined for each
        interest rate floating period. If the interest rate has been
        adjusted more
 

3

 

 
        than once during a single interest settlement period, the interest
        during each interest rate floating period shall be calculated first
        and the total interest accrued during such interest settlement
        period shall be the aggregate amount of all the interest accrued
        during each interest rate floating period within such interest
        settlement period.
 
        (2)   The interest accrued on the Loan hereunder shall be settled
        in accordance with (i) of the following:
         
         (i)                   on a monthly basis and the interest
         settlement date shall be the 20th day of each month;
          
         (ii)                on a quarterly basis and the interest
         settlement date shall be the 20th day of the last month of the
         relevant quarter;
          
         (iii)             other method:                                   
                   .

      7.1       General Principles for Repayment
     
      Party A shall repay the Loan in accordance with the following
      principles: Party B has the right to apply Party As repayment first
      towards payment of any expense which shall be borne by Party A as
      provided hereunder but has been advanced by Party B and the expenses
      incurred by Party B for realizing its creditors rights. Party B
      shall apply the balance of such repayment in the order of interest
      first and then principal adhering to the principle that the interest
      shall be fully repaid concurrently with the repayment in full of all
      the principal amounts.
       
      For any advance of which the principal has become due but unpaid for
      more than ninety days, or any advance on which the interest has
      become due but unpaid for more than ninety days, or any advance
      otherwise provided by the laws, regulations or rules, Party B may
      first apply Party As repayment towards those payments of expenses

      principal first and then interest.
       
      7.2       Payment of Interest
     
      Party A shall pay due interest to Party B on the interest settlement
      date. The first interest payment date shall be the first interest
      settlement date after the release of an advance. All the interest and
      principal amounts outstanding shall be paid in full on the last
      repayment date.
       
      7.3       Schedule for Repayment of the Principal
     
      The repayment schedule hereunder shall be determined in accordance
      with item [see Schedule A] below:

      (2)
          
          
          
      7.4       Repayment Method
     
      Party A shall deposit sufficient amount into the Account to collect
      sale processor other account at Party B before the repayment date
      provided hereunder and transfer such amount to repay the Loan (Party
      B may also debit such amount from such account to repay the Loan), or
      transfer such amount from another bank account of Party A to repay
      the Loan.
       
      7.5       Prepayment
     
      Party A may prepay the principals in full or in part upon approval by
      Party B of a written application submitted to Party B THIRTY working
      days in advance.
       
      The interest accrued on the principals to be prepaid shall be
      calculated on the basis of the actual number of days lapsed and the
      Loan Rate provided herein.
       
      If Party B approves the prepayment by Party A, Party B shall have the
      right to charge Party A the compensation fee in an amount to be
      determined in accordance with the (1) of the following methods:

       number of months remaining until the scheduled repayment date(the 
       Remaining Period) × 1%; provided, however, that the part of the
       Remaining Period that falls short of a month shall be calculated as
       a full month; or
          
       (2)
          
          
          
      If Party A is required to repay the Loan in installments and prepays
      part of the principal, the prepaid amount shall be applied in the
      reverse order of the repayment schedule. After any partial
      prepayment, the outstanding Loan shall still be subject to the Loan
      Rate provided herein.

          (1)            all costs and expenses incurred as a result of

          valuation/appraisal fees, auction fees, notary fees, service
          fees, public announcement costs, legal fees, shall be borne by
          Party A.
           
         (2)                 in respect of other fees the parties agree as

    11.2                        Use of Party As Information
     
       Party A agrees that Party B is entitled to inquire about Party As
       creditworthiness with the Credit Database or relevant authorities
       established or approved by the Peoples Bank of China and the Credit
       Reference Agency, and that Party B is entitled to provide Party As
       information to such Credit Database. Party A further agrees that
       Party B may reasonably use and disclose Party As information for
       business purpose.
         
    11.3                        Collection by Public Announcement
     
       In the event that Party A fails to repay on time any principal or
       interest or breaches any other contractual obligations hereunder,
       Party B is entitled to report to relevant authorities and demand

       repayment, receipts, vouchers made or retained by Party B during the
       course of drawdown, repayment and interest payment, and records and
       vouchers relating to the collections by Party B shall constitute
       valid evidence of the creditor-debtor relationship between the two
       parties. Party A shall not raise any objection merely because the
       above records, receipts, vouchers are made or retained by Party B.

       other contracts. No forbearance, extension of time limit,
       preferential treatment or delay in exercising any right hereunder
       shall be deemed to constitute a waiver of rights and interests
       hereunder or permit or recognition of any breach of the Contract.
       Nor shall it restrict, prevent or interfere with the continuous
       exercise of such right at a later time or any other right, nor shall
       the foregoing cause Party B to be liable in any way to the Borrower.
       
        11.6                        If Party A owes Party B any other due
        and payable debts in addition to the debts hereunder, Party B may
        debit any of Party As account at China Construction Bank in RMB or
        other currencies and may choose to repay any of the due and payable
        debts in the order it deems appropriate. Party A agrees not to
        raise any objection with respect thereto.

        address or other contact information, Party A shall promptly notify
        Party B of such change in writing. Party A shall be liable for any
        loss caused by its failure of giving prompt notice of such change.
